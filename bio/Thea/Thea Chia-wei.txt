Here is a summary of Thea Chia-wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thea is a complex and introspective person beneath her confident exterior. She has a sharp wit and quick tongue, but struggles with self-doubt and imposter syndrome. Despite this, she is fiercely independent and determined to find balance in her life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Jet black
* Skin Tone: Olive or golden brown, depending on the context (she spends time outdoors in Taiwan)

**Interests:** Thea is a freelance writer and editor with a passion for exploring themes of existentialism and morality in her work. She enjoys reading dog-eared books and scribbling notes in the margins, often losing herself in the pages of classic novels and philosophical texts.

In addition to writing, Thea values family, tradition, and community. She is drawn to the cultural heritage of Taiwan and seeks to understand its history and customs more deeply.

As she navigates her journey to Taiwan, Thea becomes increasingly interested in learning about traditional Taiwanese cuisine, music, and art forms, such as calligraphy and woodblock printing.

Her experiences in rural Taiwan also lead to an interest in gardening and agriculture, as she learns from her grandmother about the importance of local foods, sustainable farming practices, and community-supported agriculture.
