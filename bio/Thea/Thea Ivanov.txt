Her hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy bob, while her eyes are an piercing shade of blue-green, reminiscent of the ocean. Her skin has a warm golden undertone, likely from spending countless hours working outdoors or navigating dimly lit spaces.

**Interests:** Thea's interests revolve around technology, coding, and problem-solving. She is an avid reader of books on computer science, cryptography, and cybersecurity, which fuels her passion for staying ahead in the field. When she's not working, she enjoys attending underground hacking events and forums to connect with other like-minded individuals.
