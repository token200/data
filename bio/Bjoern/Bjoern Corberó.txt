Based on the short story, I've created a character profile for Bjoern Corberó:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Weight: Lean and athletic build
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and falling across his forehead
* Eyes: Piercing green with a deep intensity, hinting at the complexity within
* Face: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and a scattering of stubble on his cheeks

**Personality:**

Bjoern Corberó is a complex and introverted individual, shrouded in mystery. His reclusive nature makes it difficult for others to get close to him, but once you've broken through that barrier, he reveals a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity. He is an intensely passionate artist, driven by a strong connection to the natural world and a desire to capture its essence on canvas.

**Interests:**

* Art: Bjoern's primary passion is painting, particularly landscapes inspired by the Catalan landscape.
* Nature: His love for nature drives his art, as he seeks to convey the ephemeral and ever-changing qualities of the natural world.
* Reading: He is an avid reader of literature, particularly works that explore themes of identity, solitude, and the human condition.
* Music: Bjoern has a fondness for traditional Catalan folk music, which resonates with his soul.
* Solitude: Despite his introverted nature, he finds solace in the quiet moments of solitude, where he can retreat into his own world.

**Background:** Although Bjoern's troubled past is hinted at in the story, it remains shrouded in mystery. He appears to be self-taught, having honed his artistic skills through years of observation and experimentation. His connection to the Catalan landscape runs deep, and he seems to have an almost intuitive understanding of its rhythms and secrets.

This character profile aims to capture the essence of Bjoern Corberó as depicted in the short story, with a focus on his enigmatic personality, physical attributes, and interests that drive his art and connection to nature.
