Here's a summary of Bjoern Kalnins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bjoern is a dedicated and meticulous individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a passion for his work as a forager and botanist that drives him to continue studying the unique flora of Riga. His years of experience have given him a practiced air, but he's also not afraid to admit his own fascination with the natural world. Despite this, he often finds himself wryly observing the chaos around him, like the rowdy schoolchildren who interrupted his work.

**Physical Attributes:** Bjoern is a man in his mid-40s with an unassuming build and an air of quiet competence. He stands at about 5'8" (173 cm) tall with short, dark brown hair that's often mussed from his daily foraging expeditions. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seem to hold a wealth of knowledge and experience. He has a smattering of stubble on his chin and carries himself with an easy confidence that comes from spending years navigating the streets of Riga.

**Interests:** As a botanist, Bjoern is deeply interested in the unique flora of Riga and its adaptations to the city's climate. His research project focuses on the effects of climate change on native plant life, which he believes has significant implications for preserving the ecosystem. He also values his work as a forager, not just for its practical applications (such as creating medicinal remedies), but for its ability to connect him with the natural world. Outside of work, Bjoern likely enjoys quiet moments spent studying, reading about botany and ecology, or simply appreciating the beauty of the plant kingdom.

In terms of specific interests, some possible additions to his profile could include:

* A love of literature, particularly works by authors who explore the relationship between humans and nature (e.g. Aldo Leopold, Annie Dillard).
* A passion for amateur gardening, using his knowledge of botany to cultivate rare plants in his own greenhouse or on his small flat's balcony.
* An interest in local history and culture, as evidenced by his familiarity with Riga's unique flora and its significance to the city's identity.

Of course, these details are speculative, but they could add more depth and richness to Bjoern's character.
