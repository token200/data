**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel with flecks of gold, hinting at his connection to ancient wisdom and mysticism.
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and tied back, revealing a few wisps framing his face when his hair is loose.

**Personality:**
Luis Flavius Domitianus Augustus exudes an aura of quiet confidence, tempered by a sense of humility and curiosity. As a warrior-scholar, he possesses a deep understanding of both combat tactics and mystical forces, allowing him to approach problems from multiple angles. His insatiable thirst for knowledge drives him to explore uncharted territories, often pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable or safe.

This thirst for knowledge, coupled with his natural charisma, inspires admiration in those who have crossed paths with him, yet also elicits suspicion from those unfamiliar with his craft. Despite this, Luis maintains a calm demeanor, understanding that true power lies not in fear but in mastering one's own abilities and respecting the balance of nature.

**Interests:**
- Mastery of Transmutation: His primary focus is on understanding and controlling the mystical forces tied to the cycles of nature, particularly as they relate to the phases of the moon.
