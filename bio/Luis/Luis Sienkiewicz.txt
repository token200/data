* Bauhaus movement: He has an affinity for functional simplicity, bold experimentation, and geometric shapes, which reflects in his artistic style.
* City life: As a native New Yorker, Luis has grown up amidst the chaos of the city and sees it as a complex web of connections where every thread is intertwined with the next.
* Urban exploration: His gaze lingers on discarded trash cans, crumbling facades, and other urban decay, finding beauty in these elements.
