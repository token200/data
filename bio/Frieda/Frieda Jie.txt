**Physical Attributes:** Frieda stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her long, dark hair cascades down her back like a waterfall, often tied in a loose bun to allow for better access to her hands as she carves. Her eyes are an expressive shade of deep brown, rich with warmth and kindness. Her skin has a subtle golden undertone from years of working outdoors in the sun.

**Personality:** Frieda is a patient and compassionate individual who finds solace in the meditative process of woodcarving. She is deeply rooted in her heritage and traditional crafts, yet open to learning new techniques and incorporating modern ideas into her work.

Frieda's gentle guidance and encouragement have helped many artists find their own voice and connection with the craft.

**Interests:** Frieda is deeply interested in Japanese mythology, particularly the stories of Shinto gods and goddesses. She draws inspiration from these tales when creating her intricate carvings and scrolls, seeking to capture the essence and beauty of these ancient myths. Her love for nature and the art of woodcarving allows her to express herself creatively while maintaining a connection with the natural world.
