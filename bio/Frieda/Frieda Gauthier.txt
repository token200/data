Here's a summary of Frieda Gauthier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Frieda is a woman in her mid-40s with an unassuming presence. She stands at about 5'6" with an athletic build, honed from years of working in the bakery. Her hair is a warm, honey-blonde color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, soulful brown that seem to hold a quiet intensity. A scattering of fine lines around her eyes and mouth suggests a life well-lived, but she carries herself with a sense of elegance that belies her rugged exterior.

**Personality:** Frieda is a complex, multifaceted individual with a reputation for being prickly and enigmatic. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a heart of gold and a deep empathy for those around her. She's fiercely independent and values her alone time, but she's also deeply compassionate and willing to listen to others' troubles. Frieda has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but once you gain her trust, she'll reveal a warm, gentle side that's hard to resist.

**Interests:** Frieda is passionate about baking, particularly when it comes to creating soothing, subtle pastries that seem to speak directly to the soul. She finds solace in the quiet, meditative process of crafting each item with love and care. On mornings like any other, she'll spend hours lost in thought as she works in her bakery, experimenting with new recipes and flavors. However, there's also a deeper side to Frieda that's drawn to the world around her â€“ she loves taking walks along the river, watching people go about their daily lives, and soaking up the beauty of nature.
