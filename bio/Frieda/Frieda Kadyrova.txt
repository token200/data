Here's a summary of Frieda Kadyrova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Frieda is known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, but few people know about her complex past. She has a dry sense of humor and can be fiercely independent, having grown up in a family of Russian émigrés who valued individuality above all else. Despite this upbringing, Frieda is intensely emotional and sensitive, which she often struggles to reconcile with the sharp edges of her wit.

**Physical Attributes:** Frieda stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back, and her eyes are a piercing blue that seem to sparkle with mischief. Her features are finely chiseled, with high cheekbones and full lips that curve into a subtle, enigmatic smile.

**Interests:** Frieda has always been passionate about art, particularly painting. She spent countless hours as a child listening to her parents' stories about the Russian Revolution and the struggles of their émigré community, which sparked her interest in social justice and politics. In college, she honed her artistic skills in Paris, where she became fascinated with the works of female artists like Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt.

After completing art school, Frieda spent years developing her unique style, which blends bold expressionism with delicate Impressionist landscapes. She is a voracious reader and researcher, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology to better understand herself and the world around her. Despite her success as an artist, Frieda still finds solace in music – she plays the piano and often listens to classical composers like Chopin or Debussy to clear her mind.

As for using her mother's likeness without permission, Frieda is deeply conflicted about this aspect of her work. While she recognizes that it was a necessary compromise to achieve success, she still struggles with the moral implications of using someone else's image without their consent – particularly when that person is someone she loves and respects as much as she does herself.
