Here is a summary of Frieda Handschuh's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Frieda has an unassuming height, standing at around 5'4" (162.56 cm), with a slender yet athletic build that reflects her busy lifestyle as a baker. Her eyes are a bright blue, sparkling with warmth and kindness, and her dark brown hair is often tied back in a neat bun to keep it out of the way while she works.

**Personality:** Frieda has a fiery personality, known for her sharp wit and quick tongue. She's not afraid to speak her mind and will fiercely defend those she cares about. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a heart of gold, and she is deeply compassionate and caring towards her customers and community. Her confidence in the kitchen is matched only by her kindness to those around her.

**Interests:** Frieda has a passion for baking that knows no bounds. She spends hours experimenting with new recipes, testing flavors, and perfecting techniques. Outside of work, she enjoys trying out new dessert ideas on friends and family (much to their delight!), exploring local farmers' markets to find the freshest ingredients, and practicing yoga to keep her energy levels high. Despite her many responsibilities, Frieda always makes time for a good laugh or a lively conversation with those around her.

It's worth noting that Frieda seems to have no discernible favorite color aside from white and gold decorations in Sweet Treats, nor does she appear to be particularly interested in fashion beyond wearing whatever is most practical and comfortable.
