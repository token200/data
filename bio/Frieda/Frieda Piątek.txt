Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Frieda Piątek:

**Physical Attributes:** Frieda is likely around 5'6" (168 cm) with long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a rich chocolate drizzle. Her eyes are a bright, sparkling hazel that seem to light up when she's talking about donuts. She has a petite yet athletic build from years of sampling and baking donuts.

**Personality:** Frieda is a free-spirited individual with a playful sense of humor. She's always been drawn to the whimsical and sweet in life, which explains her nickname "Pączek" – a nod to her love of donuts. Despite her childlike enthusiasm, she's also fiercely determined and hardworking when it comes to pursuing her passions.

**Interests:** Donuts (of course!), baking, pastry arts, culinary travel, social media (particularly Instagram), photography, experimenting with new flavors and ingredients, and learning about different cultures through food. Frieda is also passionate about sharing her story of resilience and following her dreams with others.

As a bonus detail, I'd like to add that Frieda has a playful tattoo of a donut on her left wrist, which she got during one of her travels in Krakow – a symbol of her love for pączki and the memories she's made along the way.
