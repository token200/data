Frieda's physical attributes reflect her warm and inviting personality. Her bright blue eyes sparkle with warmth and creativity, while her rich brown hair adds a touch of sophistication to her overall appearance.

**Interests:** 

* Baking (she is particularly skilled at creating intricate pastries and desserts)

As it turns out, Frieda's art teacher from childhood, Mrs. Jenkins, introduced her to her portfolio filled with her own artwork. This rediscovery sparks Frieda's creative fire and sets her on the path towards rekindling her artistic passions.

With renewed purpose, Frieda returns to her bakery, her mind racing with possibilities. As she expertly pipes icing onto a tray of fresh cupcakes, she knows that this is just the beginning of a new chapter in her life.
