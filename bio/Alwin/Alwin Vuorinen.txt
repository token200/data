**Personality:** Alwin is a driven and determined individual who refuses to let go of cases that haunt him. He has a strong sense of justice and is willing to go to great lengths to uncover the truth. His years as a retired detective have honed his skills and given him a unique perspective on human behavior, allowing him to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. Alwin's obsession with "The Snowflakes" case is both admirable and concerning, as it blurs the line between justice and fixation.

**Physical Attributes:** Alwin is in his late 50s or early 60s, with a tall, imposing figure (5'10"-6'0") that commands respect. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. His hair is thinning, and his features are weathered from years of exposure to the harsh Helsinki climate.

**Interests:** As a retired detective, Alwin's interests lie in puzzles and mysteries that continue to elude him. He has an insatiable curiosity about human nature and is fascinated by the complexities of behavior. Outside of work, he enjoys quiet walks through Helsinki's snow-covered streets, lost in thought as he ponders new cases or revisits old ones. Alwin also seems to have a deep appreciation for the natural world, often finding inspiration in the beauty of the Finnish landscape. His connection to the Suomen Jääpajat club and Pekka's life hints at a more personal interest in the lives of those who come into contact with him.
