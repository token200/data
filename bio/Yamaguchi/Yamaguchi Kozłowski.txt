Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Yamaguchi Kozłowski:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Vibrant green, which seemed out of place among his bold and colorful attire
* Hair Color: Originally blond, later dyed to vibrant purple, often styled in a wild and unkempt manner

**Personality:**

Yamaguchi Kozłowski was known for his unorthodox fighting style and outrageous persona. Behind the scenes, he struggled with balancing his true self and the expectations of his alter ego. He was fiercely passionate about his craft, but also deeply introspective and empathetic. As a wrestler, he had a natural charisma that drew fans in, but as Yves LaFleur, he was more reserved and contemplative.

**Interests:**

Outside of wrestling, Yamaguchi Kozłowski had a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature. He was an avid collector of antique trinkets and mementos from his childhood, often displaying them in his dressing room as a reminder of his humble beginnings. As Yves LaFleur, he enjoyed writing poetry and short stories, using the creative outlet to process his emotions and reflect on his experiences.

Despite his rugged and athletic exterior, Yamaguchi Kozłowski had a soft spot for sentimental trinkets and family heirlooms. He cherished the handmade wooden figure given to him by his abuela and often spoke fondly of his childhood memories with his loved ones.

Overall, Yamaguchi Kozłowski was a complex and multifaceted individual, whose passion for wrestling and artistry masked a deeper emotional depth and sense of vulnerability.
