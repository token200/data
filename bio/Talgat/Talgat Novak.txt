Based on the inspiration from Talgat Nusupbekov, I've created a fictional character profile for Talgat Novak:

**Name:** Talgat Novak
**Birthdate:** March 15, 1985
**Height:** 6 feet 3 inches (191 cm)
**Weight:** 235 lbs (107 kg)
**Eye Color:** Deep blue

**Personality:**
Talgat is a confident and driven individual with an unwavering passion for combat sports. He possesses natural leadership qualities, which have inspired his teammates and fans alike. Despite facing numerous setbacks and challenges throughout his career, Talgat remains resilient and focused on his goals. His strong work ethic, discipline, and dedication to his craft have earned him the respect of his peers and mentors.

**Physical Attributes:**
In addition to his height and weight mentioned earlier, Talgat has a lean yet muscular build, honed from years of intense training and competition. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he faces in the ring, leaving an indelible mark on his opponents. A distinctive scar above his left eyebrow serves as a testament to his tough and rugged demeanor.

**Interests:**
Outside of combat sports, Talgat enjoys practicing traditional Kazakhstani martial arts, such as kurash and akhmo, which were taught to him by his father when he was a child. He is also an avid fan of classic rock music and has been known to belt out his favorite tunes after a particularly grueling training session. In his free time, Talgat enjoys spending time with his family and friends, trying new foods from different cultures, and participating in local charity events.

While this profile is inspired by the real-life Talgat Nusupbekov, it should not be confused with the actual individual.
