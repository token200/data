Based on the provided story, I have created a fictional character profile for Talgat Pires:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm) - slender yet athletic build
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that sparkle with curiosity and kindness
* Hair Color: Dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back

**Personality:**

Talgat Pires is an adventurous and free-spirited individual, always eager to explore the world around her. She has a sharp mind and quick wit, often surprising those who underestimate her due to her youthful age. Her kind heart and compassionate nature make her a beloved figure in the village, where she is known for her infectious laughter and warm smile. Despite her innate curiosity, Talgat Pires can be introverted at times, preferring to observe rather than speak, allowing her to absorb and process information before sharing it with others.

**Interests:**

* Exploring the world beyond the village, with a particular fascination for the nomadic lifestyle and the great tribes that roam the steppes

**Background:**

Talgat Pires is an orphan, having lost her parents in a tragic accident. Her uncle, Abai, took her in and raised her as his own, teaching her valuable lessons about kindness, compassion, and resilience. As she grew older, Talgat Pires became increasingly restless, feeling the call of adventure and the need to explore the world beyond her village.

I hope this character profile fits the story you had in mind!
