Based on my research, I've created a fictional character profile for Talgat Kamiński. Please note that this is a creative interpretation and not based on any actual historical or literary character.

**Name:** Talgat Kamiński ( nickname: "The Unyielding")

**Personality:** Talgat is a determined and fiercely loyal individual, much like his father's infamous reputation. He possesses a strong sense of justice and will stop at nothing to protect those he cares about. His unyielding nature can sometimes make him come across as stubborn or inflexible, but this only serves to strengthen his resolve. As a Targaryen prince, Talgat has been shaped by the turbulent history of his family's name, making him both fearless and principled.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, reminiscent of his father Aerys II's piercing gaze
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a rugged, untamed manner
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial training

**Interests:**

Talgat has a deep passion for horse breeding and riding. He spends hours in the stables, selecting and nurturing horses to become the finest warhorses Westeros has ever seen. When not immersed in his equine pursuits, Talgat enjoys studying the art of strategy and tactics, seeking to learn from the great minds of his family's history.

In private, Talgat is a romantic at heart, often finding solace in the company of beautiful horses or lost in the pages of a well-worn book. He values loyalty above all else, seeking friends who will stand by him through thick and thin.

This character profile provides a solid foundation for the enigmatic and courageous Prince Talgat Kamiński, a fitting addition to any Targaryen tale.
