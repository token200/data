Based on the inspiration from Tamerlane, I've created a fictional character profile for Talgat Alighieri:

**Physical Attributes:**
Talgat Alighieri stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing shade of emerald green, which seems to gleam with intensity in the right light. His dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, shoulder-length fashion, framing his chiseled facial features.

**Personality:**
Talgat Alighieri is a complex and charismatic individual, embodying both the strategic brilliance and ruthless ambition of Tamerlane. He possesses an unwavering sense of purpose, driving him to pursue his goals with unrelenting determination. This drive can sometimes be misinterpreted as arrogance or arrogance, but those close to him know that it's simply a manifestation of his passion for justice and leadership.

**Interests:**
Talgat Alighieri has a deep affinity for literature, philosophy, and the arts. Like his namesake Tamerlane, he encourages the intellectual pursuits in his court, hosting scholars, poets, and artists to discuss and create works that showcase the richness of human expression. He is also an accomplished strategist and military tactician, often using his intellect to outmaneuver his opponents rather than relying solely on brute force.

**Hobbies:**
In his rare moments of leisure, Talgat Alighieri enjoys horseback riding, studying ancient texts, and composing poetry himself. His verses are known for their haunting beauty and depth, offering insights into the human condition that resonate with those who hear them.

While not as well-known as Tamerlane, Talgat Alighieri's legend is beginning to spread across the vast expanse of Central Asia, earning him a reputation as a formidable leader and patron of the arts.
