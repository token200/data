Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Soren Andersson:

**Personality:** Soren is an introverted and abstract thinker. As a child, he was often lost in thought, gazing at the stars, and as an adult, he continues to be driven by his curiosity about the universe. Despite his classmates being perplexed by his ideas, Soren remains undeterred, convinced that his passion for science and technology will lead him to groundbreaking discoveries.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no information provided about Soren's physical attributes in the story. However, based on the author's style of describing people with scientific enthusiasm, I would assume he might be a bit tall and slender, possibly around 5'11" (180 cm) with bright blue eyes (blue being a fitting color for someone who spends most of their time looking up at the stars).

**Interests:** Soren's interests are centered around science and technology, particularly astronomy and physics. He is an avid reader of books on these subjects and spends his free time devouring information about the universe. His passion for discovery drives him to pursue a career in astrophysics, where he can unravel the secrets of the cosmos.

Missing attributes that I would add include:

* Age: Late 20s to early 30s (based on the story's narrative progression)
* Background: Soren's family is mentioned as worried about his affinity for science and technology, but no information is provided about his parents or upbringing in Lund.
* Education: While it's mentioned that Soren completed a degree in astrophysics at Lund University, I would add more details about his educational background and any notable academic achievements.
* Relationships: The story highlights Soren's collaboration with colleagues at the ESA, but there is no information about his personal life, relationships, or friendships outside of work.
