Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Soren Michalska:

**Personality:** Soren is a complex and introspective individual who struggles to cope with the traumas of his past. He appears to be quiet and reserved, often lost in his thoughts and emotions. Despite this, he has a deep sense of empathy and understanding for others, as evident when he connects with Jacek over their shared struggles.

**Physical Attributes:** Soren is likely a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. His height is around 5'10" (178 cm) to 6'1" (185 cm), which would make him tall and imposing, possibly an advantage for someone who served as a soldier. His eye color is blue, likely piercing and intense, reflecting his brooding nature.

**Interests:** Soren's interests seem to be limited to his own personal struggles and demons. However, it can be inferred that he has a deep appreciation for the world outside his apartment, particularly the natural beauty of snowflakes dancing in the windowpane. He might enjoy quiet moments of solitude or introspection, possibly with a dram of whiskey to accompany his thoughts.

It's worth noting that Soren appears to have struggled with finding meaning and connection in life after serving as a soldier, so his interests may be more focused on understanding himself and others rather than external hobbies or activities.
