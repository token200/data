His sense of wanderlust is contagious, and he has a way of drawing people into his orbit with his infectious enthusiasm.

**Physical Attributes:** Soren stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, suggesting that he has spent many hours outdoors exploring the natural world. His eye color is a deep, piercing brown, reminiscent of the rich soil of Colombia, where he grew up. His hair is dark and unruly, often sticking out in every direction as if it has a life of its own.

**Interests:** Soren's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his love of adventure, history, philosophy, and literature. He devours books on geography, anthropology, and psychology, and spends countless hours poring over maps, dreaming of far-off lands to explore.

As a writer, Soren draws inspiration from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's literary legacy, but also incorporates elements of philosophy, history, and cultural anthropology into his work. He is particularly drawn to the symbolism and metaphors that Garcia Marquez employed in his writing, and he seeks to capture similar themes and motifs in his own writing.

When not writing or traveling, Soren can be found practicing yoga, playing music on his guitar, or experimenting with traditional Colombian cooking. His abuela's stories of Gabriel Garcia Marquez continue to inspire him, but he is also driven by a desire to forge his own path and create something new and original in the world of literature.
