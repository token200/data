Based on the short story provided, I've created a summary of the fictional character Mykola Mastroianni:

**Physical Attributes:** Mykola is of average height, approximately 5'9" (175 cm), with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his enigmatic demeanor. His eyes are an intense shade of brown, almost piercing, which seem to see right through to the souls of those around him.

**Personality:** Mykola is a complex and mysterious individual, with a personality that is both humble and captivating. He is an artist who seems to tap into the collective unconscious, bringing forth secrets hidden deep within the human psyche. Despite his fame, he remains tight-lipped about his inspiration, preferring to let his art speak for itself. His intensity and passion for his craft are palpable, and those around him can't help but feel drawn to his enigmatic presence.

**Interests:** As an artist, Mykola is deeply interested in capturing the essence of his subjects on canvas. He seems to have a gift for tapping into people's souls, bringing forth their deepest emotions and desires. In addition to his artistic pursuits, he is also intrigued by the mysteries of the human psyche and the secrets hidden within the collective unconscious.

**Additional Details:** Mykola appears to be a solitary individual who prefers the company of his art to that of others. However, his connection with Sophia, a young woman he meets in the story, suggests that he may have a softer side and is capable of forming deep bonds with those around him.
