**Personality:** Mykola Sepp is a cunning and confident individual with a mysterious past. He has a strong sense of self-preservation and is not afraid to take risks. Despite his rough exterior, he has a calculated intelligence and is able to adapt quickly to new situations. However, his troubled past and loyalty issues may occasionally surface, making it difficult for him to form lasting connections.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a chiseled jawline that speaks to his KGB training

**Interests:** Mykola's interests seem to be centered around investigative journalism and uncovering the truth. As a freelance journalist, he is driven by a desire for accuracy and justice. He is also drawn to high-stakes cases, particularly those involving art thefts and wealthy collectors. His past as a KGB agent has likely influenced his fascination with espionage and international intrigue.

It's worth noting that Mykola's current life in Berlin seems to be centered around living a quiet existence and keeping a low profile. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that this facade may not be entirely genuine, and he is drawn back into the world of espionage and high-stakes politics.
