**Personality:**

Gulmira Taylor is a complex and multifaceted individual with a tough exterior that hides a vulnerable past. She is fiercely independent and determined to survive at any cost, but beneath her confident facade lies a deep-seated desire for connection and security. Her wit and sharp tongue serve as defense mechanisms, protecting her from the hurt and rejection she has experienced in the past. Despite this, Gulmira has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic when confronted with ridiculous situations.

**Interests:**

Gulmira's interests are largely centered around her profession as a thief and con artist. She is skilled at picking locks, safecracking, and identifying valuable items. In her free time, she enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners and taking on new challenges that test her skills. Gulmira also has a passion for art, collecting rare and unique pieces that she can fence or use as collateral in her heists.

She finds solace in the stories of great con artists throughout history, who have managed to outwit their enemies and live by their own rules. Despite her love for reading, Gulmira's time is limited, and she often prioritizes her professional life over personal hobbies.

One thing that sets Gulmira apart from other characters is her deep understanding of the social dynamics of London's underworld. She has a vast network of contacts and informants who provide her with valuable information about potential marks and rival thieves. This knowledge allows her to stay one step ahead of her competitors, but it also comes at a cost: her relationships are often superficial and transactional.

Overall, Gulmira Taylor is a force to be reckoned with, driven by a fierce determination to survive and thrive in a world that seems determined to crush her.
