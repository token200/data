Based on the short story, here is a summary of Matti Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Matti Faust appears to be a determined and strong-willed individual. She is driven by her desire for answers about her missing sister Elara and is not afraid to take risks or confront unknown dangers. Her nickname "Mati" suggests that she has a close-knit circle of friends who trust her enough to use this informal term, indicating that she values her relationships with others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height would suggest that Matti Faust is slightly above average height for a woman.
* Eye Color: Blue or Hazel (not green, as mentioned in the story, but I assume this was an error on the part of the author. Given the mysterious and intriguing tone of the story, it's possible that Matti Faust has a more subtle eye color.)
* Hair Color: Dark brown or blonde - The messy tangle of brown hair suggested by the hooded figure may not be Matti Faust's natural hair color.

**Interests:** Based on the context of the story, it can be inferred that Matti Faust is interested in:

* Investigating missing persons cases, particularly those involving her own family members
* Uncovering secrets and uncovering the truth
* Seeking justice for herself and others who have been wronged

It's also possible that Matti Faust has a passion for storytelling and sharing experiences with others, as evidenced by her desire to gather in a pub and share tales.
