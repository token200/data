Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Matti Kentaro:

**Physical Attributes:**
Matti Kentaro is a woman in her mid-30s, with a slender yet athletic build. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are a piercing brown, almond-shaped and fringed with thick lashes that seem to sparkle with intensity whenever she's on the hunt for a story.

**Personality:**
Matti Kentaro is a force to be reckoned with. She's a fiercely intelligent and ambitious individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. Her sharp instincts and fearless pursuit of truth have earned her a reputation as one of the most reliable journalists in the business. She's always up for a challenge, never backing down from an uncomfortable or contentious situation. Matti has a quick wit and a sharp tongue, which she uses to deflect attention and stay focused on the story at hand.

**Interests:**
Matti Kentaro is a voracious learner with a passion for uncovering the truth. She's always been fascinated by politics, history, and science, and loves to devour books on these topics in her free time. When she's not working, Matti can be found practicing yoga or meditating to center herself before tackling another big story. Her love of travel has also taken her to many parts of the world, where she's learned to appreciate different cultures and ways of life.

Some additional details that I came up with:

- Matti is a natural-born leader who commands respect from those around her.
- She's fiercely loyal to her colleagues and will go to great lengths to support them.
- Matti has a secret love for old movies and classic jazz music, which she listens to when she needs inspiration or relaxation.

I hope this summary fits the fictional character you had in mind!
