Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Matti Keiko:

**Personality:** Matti is a humble, dedicated, and creative individual who values her heritage and cultural traditions. She is passionate about woodblock printing and is driven to preserve and share this ancient art form with others. Her love for woodblock printing stems from her childhood fascination with her grandmother Yumi's work, and she has carried this enthusiasm into adulthood.

**Physical Attributes:** Matti is a woman of average height (around 5'6" or 168 cm), with a slender yet athletic build that allows her to move comfortably in her studio. Her eyes are dark brown, with a deep warm glow that seems to sparkle when she talks about woodblock printing. Her hair is straight and long, often tied back in a simple bun that reveals the intricate tattoos of Japanese motifs on her wrists.

**Interests:** Matti's primary interest is, of course, woodblock printing itself. She is also deeply interested in Japanese culture and history, particularly the mythology and legends depicted in her grandmother Yumi's designs. When not working in her studio, Matti enjoys exploring traditional crafts and art forms from rural Japan, as well as practicing calligraphy and suminagashi (a technique of floating ink on water).
