Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Matti Liepiņš:

**Personality:**
Matti is a quiet, introspective person with a deep love for mythology and folklore. He has a creative soul, often lost in his own thoughts and imagination. Despite his reserved nature, he possesses a strong sense of curiosity and adventure, which drives him to explore the unknown. Matti is also a kind and empathetic individual, always willing to help others find their next great read or offer guidance on their own paths.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Warm, honey-brown eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom
- **Hair:** Unkempt, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a way that makes him look endearingly tousled
- **Build:** Slender, with a gentle strength that belies his quiet demeanor

**Interests:**
Matti's passions are centered around mythology, folklore, and storytelling. He is an avid reader of classic literature, mythology texts, and ancient tomes on magical creatures. When not working at the library or exploring the woods near Riga, he can be found sketching fantastical creatures or weaving tales that transport his listeners to otherworldly realms.

**Additional Details:**
- Matti's love for the night sky is contagious; he often invites friends over for stargazing sessions on his porch, sharing stories of constellations and mythological origins behind celestial bodies.
- He has a secret talent for playing the lute, which he learned from listening to local musicians in Riga. Matti plays to soothe himself before bed or to accompany his storytelling performances.
- Despite being an expert on mythology, Matti is not immune to the charms of fairy tales and children's stories. He often indulges in these texts for their simplicity and creative potential.

This character profile aims to capture the essence of Matti Liepiņš as a quiet, imaginative person who brings wonder and magic into the lives of those around him through his storytelling and passion for mythology.
