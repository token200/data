Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Elina Cara:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown/long hair often whipped around her face
* Other notable features: athletic build, toned physique from years of surfing

**Personality:**

* Resilient and determined individual who has faced numerous challenges in her career as a professional surfer
* Struggled with balancing her desire for victory with the need to take care of herself and maintain her mental health
* Emphasizes finding balance within herself, highlighting the importance of self-care and wellness
* Inspires hope and determination in those around her through her example

**Interests:**

* Surfing (obviously!)
* Yoga and meditation (found a positive outlet for managing stress and finding inner peace)
* Balance and wellness (strives to prioritize self-care in all aspects of life)
* Connection with nature (surfing is deeply connected to the ocean, which Elina feels is essential to her well-being)

Note: Since I couldn't find any information about specific interests outside of surfing, yoga/meditation, balance/wellness, and connection with nature were inferred from her experiences and behaviors in the original story.
