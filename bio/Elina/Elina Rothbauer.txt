Personality: Elina appears to be introspective, emotional, and deeply connected to her past. She has a strong sense of nostalgia and is driven by a desire for closure and connection with her loved ones. Despite leaving Ravenswood 10 years ago, she still feels a strong affinity for the town and its people, as evident in her warm reunion with Mrs. Jenkins.

Physical Attributes: Elina's physical appearance is not explicitly described in the story, but based on the context, here are some possible details that can be inferred:

* Eye Color: The story mentions "her eyes scanning the small town" without specifying her eye color, but based on the warm tone of the narrative, it's possible that Elina has brown or hazel eyes.

Interests: Elina's primary interest is music. As mentioned in the story, she was a pianist who won the prestigious Golden Piano competition, and she still feels an overwhelming passion for playing the piano. The scent of lavender wafting from her childhood home also evokes memories of summers spent listening to her mother play music, further emphasizing Elina's love for music.

Additional interests: Given her background as a renowned pianist, it can be assumed that Elina is also interested in:

* Performance and competition (as evidenced by her past success in the Golden Piano competition)
* Music therapy or healing (her mother passing away and her need to honor her legacy suggests a deep connection between music and emotional well-being)
