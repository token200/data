I must correct you again - there is no fictional character named Elina Saldana. The name seems to be a mix of actresses, specifically Gina Carano and Salma Hayek's co-star from the movie "Crash" (2004), but I couldn't find any information about an actress with this name.

However, if you'd like me to create a fictional character profile for Elina Saldana, I can do that. Here is a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Name:** Elina Saldana

**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s (actual age not specified)

**Personality:** Elina is a confident, determined, and fiercely independent individual. She has a strong sense of justice and will fight for what she believes in. Her quick wit and sharp tongue can sometimes be intimidating to those who don't know her, but once you gain her trust, she's fiercely loyal and protective.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with a golden brown ring around the iris
* Hair: Dark brown, shoulder-length, and curly
* Build: Athletic yet toned, with broad shoulders and a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right bicep

**Interests:** Elina is passionate about martial arts, particularly kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. She's an avid rock climber and enjoys hiking in the outdoors. She's also a talented artist and painter, often using her art as a way to express herself and tell stories.

Please note that this profile is entirely fictional and not based on any real person or actress.
