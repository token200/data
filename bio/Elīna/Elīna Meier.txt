Based on the short story, here is a summary of Elīna Meier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elīna appears to be a introspective and creative individual who has been held back by fear and self-doubt. However, with the support of her childhood friend Jānis, she begins to reveal a more determined and passionate side. Her conversation with Jānis suggests that she is a loyal and grateful person who values close relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no direct description of Elīna's physical appearance in the provided text. However, based on her name (which is traditional Latvian) and the cultural context, I would make some educated guesses:

* Height: Average to above-average height for a woman (around 5'6" to 5'8")
* Eye Color: Dark brown or blue-green eyes, which are common in Baltic countries where Elīna's name originates

**Interests:** From the text, we can infer that Elīna has strong creative interests:

* Painting: She is drawn to painting as a form of artistic expression.
* Art in general: Her conversation with Jānis suggests that she has a deep appreciation for art and is eager to pursue her dreams.

It's also possible that Elīna's creative interests may extend beyond visual arts, given the cultural context and the fact that music is mentioned specifically.
