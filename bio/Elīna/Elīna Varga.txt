She's passionate, introspective, and determined, always chasing the muse that drives her to create.

Music plays a significant role in Elīna's life, as she often listens to traditional Latvian instruments like the kanklēji (stringed instrument) or the balsspeles (fiddle). She finds solace in nature and spends hours foraging in forests, gathering inspiration from the textures, colors, and scents of the natural world.
