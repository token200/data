**Personality:** Detlef is known for his sharp mind, quick wit, and tireless work ethic. He possesses a unique blend of street smarts and literary flair, which has served him well in his career as a detective. He is intelligent, resourceful, and able to think outside the box, often coming up with creative solutions to complex problems.

**Physical Attributes:** Detlef stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of physical activity while investigating cases. His dark brown hair is often styled neatly, framing his bright, inquisitive eyes - a deep shade of blue that seems to sparkle with intensity when he's on the verge of solving a case.
