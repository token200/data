Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Detlef Harris:

**Personality:** Detlef Harris is a seasoned and experienced detective with a keen instinct for sniffing out deception. He has a measured tone and seems to approach situations with a level head, which suggests that he is a logical and analytical person. Despite his years of experience, Detlef still shows curiosity and a willingness to help others, as seen when he agrees to review evidence for Hans Müller's case.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much information about Detlef Harris' physical attributes. However, based on his profession and age (implied to be older than 40, given that he is described as a "former" detective), it can be assumed that he is likely in his late 50s or early 60s.

One detail that can be inferred from the story is Detlef's height. Given that Hans Müller is an "undercover agent", it is likely that they are of similar stature, and Hans is described as being able to "emerge from the darkness" without any issues with space constraints in the alleyway. Therefore, we can infer that Detlef Harris is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) or slightly shorter.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, there is no mention of Detlef's eye color in the story.

**Interests:** Based on his profession as a detective and his expertise in sniffing out deception, it can be inferred that Detlef's interests include:

* Investigating crimes and solving puzzles
* Analyzing evidence and piecing together complex cases
* Reading up on new techniques and technologies to improve his skills
* Staying informed about the latest developments in law enforcement and criminology

Additionally, given that he has a keen instinct for deception, Detlef may also have interests in psychology, sociology, or other fields that help him understand human behavior.
