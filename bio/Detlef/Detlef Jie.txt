Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Detlef Jie:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - This height adds to his imposing presence, fitting for a detective who seems to command respect.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. These piercing eyes convey intensity, intelligence, and a keen sense of observation.

**Personality:**

Detlef Jie is portrayed as an enigmatic and stoic individual. He appears to be driven by his work, with a mind always racing to solve the next puzzle.

However, there are hints of determination and resolve within him. When thinking about the case, Detlef's thoughts drift back to Sophie De La Croix's smile, indicating a connection with the victim on a human level. This suggests that despite his stoic demeanor, he may have a soft spot for those who were wronged.

**Interests:**

It seems that Detlef Jie is deeply invested in his work as a detective and is driven by a strong sense of justice. His interest lies in uncovering the truth behind complex cases like Sophie De La Croix's murder, particularly when it involves deceit and hidden secrets among Amsterdam's high society.

His interests also appear to extend beyond the realm of justice, however. There is an underlying curiosity about human nature, as evidenced by his consideration of Sophie's life beneath her glamorous exterior. This curiosity suggests that Detlef Jie values understanding people and their motivations, even if it means wading through darkness and complexity.

While we don't have much information on his personal life or hobbies outside of work, it is clear that justice and uncovering the truth are paramount in his interests.
