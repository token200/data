Based on the inspiration from the short story, I'll create a brief summary of Toms Hussein:

**Physical Attributes:** Toms is a 30-year-old man who stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to hold a hint of warmth despite his introverted nature.

**Personality:** Toms is a quiet and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor that he often uses to deflect from deeper conversations. He has a hard time connecting with people, especially in the early stages of relationships or social interactions. This stems from years of working alone as an engineer abroad, where he relied solely on his own intellect to solve problems rather than relying on others.

**Interests:** Toms is an avid reader, often getting lost in science fiction and philosophy novels. He's also an enthusiast of classic rock music and spends hours listening to vinyl records by The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. In his free time, he enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, finding solace in nature's vastness and beauty.

**Background:** Toms is a former engineer who spent several years working abroad, honing his skills and building a unique perspective on life. However, after facing some personal losses and feeling disconnected from his hometown, he decided to return home to reconnect with old friends, family, and the place that shaped him as a person.
