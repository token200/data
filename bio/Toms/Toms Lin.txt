**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)

* Studying security protocols and layouts to stay one step ahead of his rivals
* Experimenting with new recipes in his bakery, often incorporating subtle hints and codes into his creations

It's worth noting that Toms' persona is carefully crafted to serve multiple purposes. In public, he presents himself as a humble baker; in private, he becomes "The Baker," a master thief with an uncanny ability to outwit his opponents. This dual identity allows him to navigate the world of high-stakes thievery while maintaining a level of anonymity and control.
