Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Tom (corrected from Toms) Ivanov:

**Physical Attributes:** Tom is a tall and lean individual, standing at 6'2" with an athletic build that he maintains through regular exercise. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look perpetually tired. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost grey, which seem to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him a resolute and determined appearance.

**Personality:** Tom is a brooding and introspective person who seems to exist in a world of shadows. As a private investigator, he's developed a thick skin and a tough exterior that hides his emotional vulnerability. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to uncover the truth. Tom is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but beneath his reserved demeanor lies a deep well of empathy and compassion.

**Interests:** Outside of work, Tom enjoys art, music, and literature, which he finds solace in during long hours spent pouring over clues. He's particularly fascinated by the works of Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch, whose bold and expressive styles resonate with his own creative inclinations. Tom also has a passion for jazz music and can often be found listening to Coltrane or Miles Davis late at night as he ponders cases. When not working, he's likely to be found exploring the city's hidden corners or practicing yoga to clear his mind.

As for Sofia's case, Tom's interests seem to align with her art world connections â€“ he has a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of artistic trends. His fascination with the small smudge of paint on the pavement suggests that he's not just looking at the surface level of this case but also willing to dig deeper into the creative world that Sofia inhabited.
