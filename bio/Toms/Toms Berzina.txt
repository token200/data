Based on the short story provided, I will create a character profile for Tom Berzina:

**Physical Attributes:**
Tom Berzina is a middle-aged man with a slender build. He stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall and has an unassuming presence that often goes unnoticed by those who meet him. His hair is dark brown, typically worn short and neatly trimmed. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seem to hold a world of emotion within them.

**Personality:**
Tom is a quiet and introspective person who keeps his emotions locked away beneath the surface. He has an affinity for observation and listening, often preferring to watch and listen rather than speak up himself. This reserved nature can sometimes make him appear aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but he is deeply empathetic and cares deeply about those around him.

**Interests:**
Tom's main passion is writing poetry, which has become an integral part of his life after reconnecting with it through his experiences. He finds solace in the written word, using poetry as a way to express himself and connect with others on a deeper level. His other interests include reading, nature walks, and cooking. Despite his reserved nature, Tom is deeply curious about the world around him and has a love for learning new things.

**Background:**
Tom grew up with an estranged brother, Kaspars, who eventually returned to reconnect with him after years apart. This reunion had a profound impact on Tom's life, reigniting his passion for writing poetry and opening him up to the possibility of forgiveness and second chances.
