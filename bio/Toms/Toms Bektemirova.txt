Based on the inspiration provided, I will create a fictional character profile for Toms Bektemirova. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with intelligence and creativity. She has a small tattoo of a sun on her left ankle and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Toms is a free-spirited and adventurous person who is always up for a challenge. She's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking risks that put her at odds with authority figures.

Toms is highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on her feet and come up with creative solutions to problems.

Toms has a passion for photography, which she uses as a way to capture the beauty of the world around her. She's also an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and science fiction. In her free time, Toms enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and playing the guitar. She's also a bit of a foodie, experimenting with new recipes and flavors in her small kitchen.

**Background:**
Toms grew up in a nomadic family that traveled extensively throughout the world. This upbringing instilled in her a love of adventure and a sense of curiosity about different cultures. After completing her education, she spent several years working as a freelance photographer and writer, traveling to new destinations and capturing their stories on film.
