Here's a summary of Tomsz Kozlowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tomasz Kozlowski is a complex individual with a mysterious past. On the surface, he appears charming and charismatic, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a master manipulator who uses his charm to get what he wants. He has a tendency to keep his secrets locked away, even from those close to him. However, when faced with intense emotions or strong connections, Tomasz's reserved nature begins to crack, revealing a deep sense of vulnerability and longing.

**Physical Attributes:** Tomasz is described as an average-looking guy who often gets mistaken for someone ordinary. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which is slightly above the average height for a male. His piercing blue eyes are his most striking feature, giving away his intense gaze and deep emotional well-being. His physical appearance is complemented by sharp cheekbones and a lean build, hinting at an athletic or otherwise physically fit individual.

**Interests:** Tomasz has a fondness for long walks along the riverbank, where he can lose himself in thought. This solitary activity allows him to reflect on his past, contemplate his future, and momentarily escape the constraints of his carefully constructed life. As a man who has mastered manipulation, Tomasz is naturally drawn to activities that allow him to control his environment or manipulate external circumstances. His encounters with Sophia suggest an interest in rekindling connections from his past and exploring deeper emotional connections.
