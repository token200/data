Based on the short story, here is a summary of Tomasz Szymanska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tomasz Szymanska is a cunning and resourceful individual with a quick wit and charm. However, beneath his polished exterior lies a more complex personality. He has a tendency to blend into the crowd, which suggests that he may struggle with feelings of loneliness or disconnection. Despite this, he is drawn to people who are plucky and determined, such as Sophia. For the first time in years, Tomasz feels like he's being forced to confront the consequences of his actions, indicating a growing sense of self-awareness and moral introspection.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a quiet athleticism that allows him to move quickly and easily through crowded spaces
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt in his line of work
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small nose that gives him a distinctive, angular appearance

**Interests:** Tomasz Szymanska's interests are largely centered around his profession as a pickpocket. He is drawn to the art of stealth and deception, and takes great pride in being able to snatch valuables from unsuspecting tourists without them even noticing. However, his encounter with Sophia has left him questioning everything he thought he knew about himself and his profession. As he navigates this new moral landscape, Tomasz may begin to explore other interests or passions that bring him joy and fulfillment outside of his work as a thief.

It's worth noting that these physical attributes are speculative, and can be adjusted or changed based on the author's vision for the character.
