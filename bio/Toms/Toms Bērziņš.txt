Based on the short story about Kārlis Bērziņš, I'll create a fictional character profile for Tom's Bērziņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue
- Hair Color: Dark blond
- Build: Athletic and lean, with broad shoulders and powerful legs.

**Personality:** Tom's Bērziņš is a charismatic and compassionate individual. He exudes confidence on the ice but remains humble and grounded off it. His infectious smile and warm demeanor have won over fans and teammates alike. As mentioned in the story, he is known for his kind heart and generosity, often going out of his way to support those in need.

**Interests:** Hockey, of course! Tom's passion for the sport knows no bounds. When not on the ice, he enjoys playing recreational hockey with friends, practicing yoga to maintain flexibility, and exploring the outdoors to clear his mind. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology.

While there are many characteristics from Kārlis Bērziņš, Tom's personality has some distinct traits of his own, such as having a more reserved demeanor despite being charismatic and athletic.
