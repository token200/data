Here's a summary of Toms Larsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Toms is a ruggedly handsome Swedish musician in his mid-30s. He stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm) tall with an athletic build. His hair is typically messy and unkempt, often falling across his forehead. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait he inherited from his parents. Toms has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly intense gig.

**Personality:** Toms is a introspective and creative individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's passionate about music and is not afraid to express himself through his art. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a listening ear. Toms' past experiences have made him resilient, but they've also left emotional scars that still linger. He struggles with feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can make it difficult for him to open up to new people.

**Interests:** Music is, of course, Toms' primary passion. He's an accomplished guitarist, singer-songwriter, and musician who has spent countless hours honing his craft. In addition to music, Toms enjoys reading literature (especially Swedish authors like Stieg Larsson), hiking in the Swedish countryside, and exploring new cities. He's also a talented cook and loves trying out different recipes in his free time.

It's worth noting that while the story doesn't provide extensive information about Toms' interests outside of music, it does mention his love for ABBA records and his fondness for cozy nights spent performing with "The Midnight Sun".
