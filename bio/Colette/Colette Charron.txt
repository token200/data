**Physical Attributes:**
Colette stands at approximately 5'2" (157 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, almost black in their depth, which seems to bore into those she meets. Her dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, effortless manner that adds to her enigmatic aura.

**Personality:**
Colette exudes quiet confidence and authority, commanding attention without seeking it. She possesses an air of mystery, as if there are layers to her personality that only reveal themselves to those who have earned her trust. Her piercing indigo eyes seem to see right through to the souls of those she meets, making them feel seen and understood on a deep level.

**Interests:**
Colette is passionate about creating art that tells stories and conveys emotions. She draws inspiration from the raw energy and emotion in the world around her, using bold colors and textures to capture the essence of her subjects' inner lives. Her art is not just about beauty; it's about conveying truth and authenticity.

Outside of her artistic pursuits, Colette appears to be deeply interested in philosophy, psychology, and sociology. She seems to have a fascination with the human condition, often exploring themes of identity, trauma, and social justice in her work. This introspective nature makes her an intriguing and complex individual, full of depth and layers.

As hinted at in the short story, Colette is also drawn to the idea of being a guardian or keeper of secrets and stories that need to be told. She seems to have a deep sense of empathy and understanding for others, which drives her creative process and fuels her passion for sharing these stories through her art.
