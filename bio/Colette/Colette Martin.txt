Here is a summary of Colette Martin's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Colette Martin is a free-spirited and creative individual with a passion for art. She is driven by her imagination and has a unique ability to capture the beauty in the world around her. Her artistic nature allows her to see beyond the ordinary and find inspiration in the simplest things. She is empathetic, encouraging, and supportive of others, having been instilled with these qualities by her parents.

**Physical Attributes:** Colette Martin stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, while her eyes are a deep shade of indigo that sparkle with creativity.

In addition to art, Colette values community and connection, having formed lasting friendships with fellow artists like Jasper Lee. She is also drawn to antique shops and vintage treasures, finding inspiration in forgotten relics and stories of the past.

* A fondness for the outdoors, evident from her ability to find inspiration in rolling hills and vast skies.
* A creative childhood, marked by hours spent sketching and drawing fantastical creatures and dreamscapes.
* A strong sense of empathy and encouragement, reflecting her parents' supportive nature.

These details aim to flesh out Colette's character while staying true to the spirit of the original story.
