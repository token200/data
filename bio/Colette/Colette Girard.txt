Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Colette Girard's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Colette is intelligent, determined, and fiercely independent. She has a strong sense of justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. Despite her sharp mind and quick wit, she is not afraid to show vulnerability or emotion, as evident from her frustration when faced with an unsolvable case. Her passion for justice drives her to keep pushing forward, even in the face of adversity.

**Physical Attributes:** Colette is a woman of average build, standing at 5'8" (172 cm) tall. Her eye color is a deep brown that seems to bore into those she interviews, conveying her intense focus and attention to detail. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a neat and polished style that accentuates her sharp features.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Colette's interests lie primarily in uncovering the truth and solving complex cases. She has a particular fascination with financial crimes and corruption, which drove her to take on the high-profile embezzlement case that ultimately led to her breakthrough. Outside of work, it can be assumed that Colette enjoys staying active, possibly through exercise or sports, as evidenced by her ability to pack up her things and leave for the day at night.

It is worth noting that some details about Colette's physical attributes were not specified in the original story, such as her age, height, weight, etc., so I had to fill them in with information based on typical characteristics of a woman who works as a private investigator.
