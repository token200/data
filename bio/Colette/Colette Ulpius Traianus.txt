Here is a summary of Colette Ulpius Traianus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Colette is a free-spirited individual who craves intellectual stimulation and creative expression. She is fiercely independent and longs to break free from the constraints of her aristocratic upbringing. Despite her bold nature, she has a vulnerable side and struggles with self-doubt. Her curiosity and love for learning drive her to explore new ideas and perspectives.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (172 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue-green (almost turquoise), a trait inherited from her Roman heritage
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in loose waves
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-smooth complexion with a hint of olive undertones, a testament to her mixed ancestry

**Interests:** Colette is passionate about philosophy, mathematics, and literature. She devours books on these subjects, devouring knowledge like a hungry mind. Her love for performance and storytelling is evident in her acting background as Aurora. However, she also has a fascination with the world of espionage and counter-intelligence, having been drawn to Marcus' mysterious occupation.

As Colette navigates her dual identities, it becomes clear that she values freedom, intellectual curiosity, and creative expression above all else. Her journey as Aurora will likely continue to shape her perspective on life, but for now, she remains torn between the two worlds: the aristocratic Rome of her past and the thrilling world of espionage and performance that she has created for herself.
