Here is a summary of the fictional character Colette Yuji:

**Physical Attributes:** Colette stands at 5'6" (168 cm) with striking features. Her bright pink hair is one of her most distinctive physical characteristics, and it frames her heart-shaped face and expressive eyes. Her eye color is a deep shade of indigo that seems to sparkle with energy.

**Personality:** Colette is a force to be reckoned with - she's fiercely determined, passionate, and unapologetically herself. She exudes confidence on stage, but behind the scenes, she's humble and grounded, crediting her upbringing in Yokohama for instilling in her a strong work ethic and determination to succeed. Colette is driven by a desire to use her platform for creative expression and social justice.

**Interests:** In addition to music, Colette has a deep passion for art, particularly painting and drawing. She's always been fascinated by the intersection of art and activism, and she sees Electric Storm's music as a way to channel her emotions and experiences into something meaningful. When not touring or performing, Colette enjoys exploring new cities, trying out local street food, and supporting emerging artists.

**Additional Details:** Colette has a small tattoo of a sun on her left ankle, symbolizing the power of creativity and hope. She's also an avid fan of Japanese literature and poetry, which inspires much of Electric Storm's lyrics.
