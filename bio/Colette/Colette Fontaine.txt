Here's a summary of Colette Fontaine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Colette is a complex and introspective person, often struggling with feelings of disconnection and anxiety. She has a charismatic stage presence, but behind the glamour, she feels trapped in a role that isn't truly hers. Despite her enigmatic smile and captivating voice, she's introverted and may appear guarded to those who don't know her well. Colette is fiercely independent and values her individuality above all else.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in loose waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Olive with a smattering of freckles across her cheeks

**Interests:** Colette's passions lie beyond music. She's an avid reader and writer, often finding solace in the words of authors like Sylvia Plath and Emily Dickinson. In her free time, she enjoys exploring the outdoors, hiking in the mountains, and practicing yoga to clear her mind.

Colette is also deeply fascinated by art and philosophy, frequently attending galleries and exhibitions, and engaging in heated debates with friends about existentialism and human nature. She's a hopeless romantic at heart, always on the lookout for authentic connections and genuine conversations that allow her to grow as a person.

While Colette's love for music has brought her fame and success, it also makes her feel like she's living someone else's life â€“ a life of curated performances and scripted personas. This disconnect drives her desire to break free from the expectations of others and forge her own path, one that allows her to be true to herself without apology.
