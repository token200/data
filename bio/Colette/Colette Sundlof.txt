She has a small tattoo of a paintbrush on her left wrist and often wears eclectic outfits that reflect her artistic personality.

**Personality:**
Colette is a fiercely independent and confident individual who isn't afraid to speak her mind. Her passion for art drives her to take risks and challenge the status quo, which sometimes leads to controversy but also fuels her creativity. She's intensely focused on her craft, often spending 12-hour days in her studio perfecting her techniques. Despite her tough exterior, Colette has a soft spot for those who support her artistic vision, and she's known to be loyal and grateful to her loved ones.

**Interests:**
Colette is deeply passionate about art, music, and literature. She spends hours listening to jazz and experimental music, which inspires her abstract expressionist style. Her favorite authors include Virginia Woolf and James Joyce, whom she finds influence her writing-like brushstrokes in her paintings. Colette also enjoys practicing yoga and meditation, which helps her center herself amidst the chaos of the art world. She's an avid collector of antique furniture and vintage cameras, often incorporating them into her sculptures.

**Quirks:**
Colette has a habit of talking to herself when working on a new piece, which her friends find endearing but also occasionally worry about. She's prone to making spontaneous decisions, such as switching mediums or techniques mid-project, which keeps her art fresh and exciting. Despite her confidence, Colette sometimes struggles with self-doubt and the pressure to constantly innovate, but she overcomes these fears by surrounding herself with supportive people who share her vision.
