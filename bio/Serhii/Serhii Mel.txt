Serhii is likely in his mid-to-late 30s. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with a rugged, weathered appearance, probably due to his military background. His eye color is brown, which could be a testament to his Ukrainian heritage.

**Personality:**
Serhii is a introspective and emotional person who has struggled to cope with the trauma of war. He is haunted by memories of his past battles and struggles to find comfort in his new life in Moscow. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Natasha, and will go to great lengths to protect them. Serhii's experiences have also made him more reserved and less trusting of others, as evidenced by his initial hesitation to share his country of origin with the taxi driver.

Serhii's interests appear to be centered around literature, with a particular fondness for the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. These books provide him with solace and comfort, offering a fleeting escape from his troubled past. His love for literature also reflects his introspective nature and desire for self-discovery.
