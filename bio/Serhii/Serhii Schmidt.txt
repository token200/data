**Physical Attributes:**

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Serhii's interests are deeply rooted in his profession. He is skilled in surveillance, interrogation techniques, and analyzing evidence. However, it appears that his true passion lies in family and protecting those close to him.

Additionally, Serhii seems to appreciate the quiet, introspective nature of small-town life, as evident in his choice of meeting Natalia at a small caf√© on 5th Avenue. This suggests that he values simplicity, familiarity, and the comfort of routine over the fast-paced and high-stakes world of espionage.
