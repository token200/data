Serhii Kuznetsova is a complex and multifaceted individual. Behind the carefully crafted mask of Serhii, she wears multiple hats - those of a brilliant scientist, a Ukrainian refugee, and a woman with secrets. This duality makes her both fascinating and intimidating to those around her. On one hand, she's fiercely intelligent, analytical, and determined. She has a strong sense of self-preservation that drives her to make tough decisions. On the other hand, she struggles with vulnerability, trust issues stemming from her past, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility for her double life.

**Additional Details:**
Serhii's experience with Viktor hints at a deep-seated longing for human connection and love. Her ability to compartmentalize her past and present selves suggests that Serhii has become adept at maintaining healthy boundaries between different aspects of her life.

Given her background, it's likely that Serhii values independence, resilience, and intellectual pursuits. She might be drawn to people who understand and respect her complexities, yet still manage to challenge her when needed.
