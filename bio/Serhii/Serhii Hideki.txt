* Skin Tone: Olive-toned from spending time outdoors in Japan

**Personality:**

Serhii is an ambitious and determined individual who isn't afraid to take risks. He's driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth. His Ukrainian heritage has given him a unique perspective on cultural differences, which he uses to navigate the complexities of Tokyo's vibrant media scene.

Despite his tough exterior, Serhii has a compassionate side and is deeply empathetic towards those affected by the tech startup's deceitful practices. He's fiercely independent and values his autonomy, often preferring to work alone rather than as part of a team.

Serhii's fascination with technology and culture stems from his upbringing in Ukraine and later Japan. He sees the intersection of these two worlds as a rich source of inspiration for his work.

In addition to his professional interests, Serhii enjoys sipping matcha lattes at small cafes like the one in Shibuya mentioned in the story.
