Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ilze Kovács' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Ilze Kovács is a brilliant mathematician who is passionate about her work, particularly in fractal geometry. However, she has been neglecting her own well-being and personal relationships due to her obsessive pursuit of knowledge. She is introverted and may come across as aloof or absent-minded at times, but this is partly due to her focus on her work rather than a lack of care for others.

Physical Attributes: Ilze Kovács is likely a woman with an unassuming appearance that belies her exceptional intelligence. Her height is not specified in the story, but it's possible she stands around 5'6" (168 cm) to 5'8" (173 cm), which would be typical for someone who spends most of their time hunched over papers and books. Her eye color could range from light brown to dark brown, depending on her ancestry.

Interests: Ilze's interests lie primarily in mathematics, particularly fractal geometry. She is drawn to the abstract, theoretical, and unknown aspects of her field. She also has a strong appreciation for literature and storytelling, which is evident in her love for reading and discussing books with her sister Léa. Her passion for mathematics stems from her childhood fascination with Soviet engineers who achieved seemingly impossible feats, inspiring her to push the boundaries of human knowledge.

Other Interests: Ilze's interests may also include science fiction and speculative ideas about space exploration, given her admiration for Soviet engineers working towards revolutionary projects like space programs.
