Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jannis Hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jannis is described as innovative, fearless, and unwaveringly dedicated to her craft. She is also shown to be quite confident in her abilities and unafraid to take risks. This confidence is rooted in her passion for weaving and textile art, which drives her to push boundaries and inspire others with her work.

**Physical Attributes:** Jannis Hao is of unknown ethnicity (the story does not specify), but she appears to be a slender individual with an athletic build, given the description of her "wave of her hand" dismissing Kaito. It can be assumed that she stands at around 5'8" to 6'0" tall, based on the typical height range for adults in East Asian cultures.

Her eye color is not specified, but it is described as being expressive and likely striking given her attention to detail and dedication to her craft. Her hair color is also unspecified, although it may be dark brown or black, common colors for many East Asian individuals.

**Interests:** Jannis's primary interest is weaving and textile art, which has been a passion of hers since childhood. She is particularly known for her innovative approach to dyeing and weaving, and she spends most of her time creating new fabrics and designs that blend traditional techniques with modern flair.

She also values her independence and is driven by a desire to create something truly original and meaningful, rather than simply following in the footsteps of her family or meeting expectations placed upon her. This independence is reflected in her dismissive wave towards Kaito, who was meant to be her apprentice but had begun to take over her work.
