Here is a summary of Jannis Altmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jannis is a complex character who has struggled with feelings of isolation and disconnection from his life outside of soccer. He appears introverted and perhaps a bit melancholic at first glance, having retreated into himself after his career-ending injury. However, as the story progresses, we see glimpses of a dry sense of humor and a deep love for his family, particularly his granddaughter Lena. With the help of her visit, Jannis begins to rediscover his passion for life and finds a renewed sense of purpose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, piercing blue eyes, dark hair

These physical attributes suggest that Jannis is a sturdy, athletic build, which would have been necessary for his soccer career. His bright blue eyes convey a sense of intensity and focus, while his dark hair hints at a more reserved personality.

**Interests:** Prior to his granddaughter's visit, Jannis was largely consumed by his love for soccer. He spent most of his time watching old matches, playing with toys, or staring blankly at the TV. However, as he begins to reconnect with the world around him, new interests emerge:

* Gardening: Jannis takes up gardening as a way to connect with nature and find a sense of purpose outside of soccer.
* Local Soccer Team: He joins a local team for fun, allowing him to stay involved in the sport that once defined his life.
* Coaching Lena's Little League Team: This role brings him joy and fulfillment, as he is able to mentor and guide young athletes, passing on his knowledge and passion for the game.

These interests suggest that Jannis has a more well-rounded personality than initially meets the eye. He is not just a one-dimensional sports hero but a complex individual with multiple passions and interests.
