**Personality:** Jannis appears to be a driven and determined individual, evident from his long hours as a freelance journalist and his ability to navigate Tokyo's complex streets with ease. However, he also seems to be cautious and guarded, particularly when faced with mysterious or unsettling situations (as seen in the initial phone call). He is likely a quick thinker and able to think on his feet.

**Physical Attributes:** Jannis is not explicitly described in terms of height, but based on the description of him standing on a bridge overlooking Tokyo Bay at midnight, it's possible that he is an average to slightly above-average height. His eye color is not mentioned, but given his Japanese background, it's likely brown or dark brown.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Jannis is clearly passionate about investigative journalism and uncovering hidden truths. He appears to be well-versed in the inner workings of Tokyo's government and industry, suggesting that he has a strong interest in politics and corruption. His encounter with Yumi Nakahara suggests that he may also have an interest in international news and global affairs.
