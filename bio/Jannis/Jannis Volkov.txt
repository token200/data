Jannis is deeply connected to music, particularly punk rock, which he believes serves as a medium for self-expression and community building. His passion for journalism allows him to explore these themes in depth, often finding catharsis through writing about his own experiences and emotions.

His encounters with Maxine Wilder of "Electric Chaos" were pivotal moments that helped Jannis connect with others who understand the power of music as a unifying force beyond cultural boundaries.
