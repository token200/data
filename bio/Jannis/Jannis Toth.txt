Here is a summary of Jannis Toth's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jannis Toth is a calculated and professional mercenary with a dry sense of humor. He has seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed, which has made him cynical but also resourceful and efficient in high-pressure situations. Despite his tough exterior, he has a certain level of respect for those who can command authority without resorting to brute force.

**Physical Attributes:** Jannis Toth is approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, often seeming almost piercing in their intensity when focused on his surroundings. He has short, dark brown hair that's always impeccably styled, framing his sharp features and angular jawline.

**Interests:** Jannis Toth seems to have little time for leisure activities or personal interests outside of his work as a mercenary. However, it can be inferred that he is drawn to missions that challenge him and require strategic thinking. He appears to be someone who values efficiency, precision, and control, often relying on his own wits and skills to get the job done.

It's worth noting that Jannis Toth's character is heavily influenced by his background as a former soldier, which suggests that he may have a strong sense of discipline and duty. His interactions with The Archon also hint at a deeper respect for authority figures who can command trust and loyalty.

One possible interest that could be explored further is Jannis Toth's personal morality code. As someone who has seen the worst of humanity, he may struggle with questions of right and wrong, often walking a fine line between his duties as a mercenary and his own sense of justice. This inner conflict could create an intriguing dynamic in future storylines or interactions with other characters.
