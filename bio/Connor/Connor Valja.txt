Here's a summary of Connor Valja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Connor Valja is a introspective and emotionally guarded individual. He has a tendency to shut out the world around him to protect himself from getting hurt again, which makes it difficult for others to connect with him on an emotional level. Despite this, he is not unfriendly and can be fiercely loyal to those he cares about. He struggles with sentimental feelings and often comes across as stoic or detached.

**Physical Attributes:** Connor Valja stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with a lean build that suggests he prioritizes his physical health over other aspects of his life. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he looks at, giving him an intense and brooding appearance. His dark brown hair is often unkempt and shoulder-length, adding to his rough-around-the-edges demeanor.

**Interests:** Connor Valja appears to be someone who values independence and self-sufficiency above all else. He has a strong desire for control over his life and is hesitant to let others in or ask for help. He seems to prefer quiet, solitary activities such as staring at the wall (as depicted in the story) or contemplating the past, rather than engaging in social interactions or pursuing new experiences.

It's worth noting that Connor Valja's interests are not explicitly stated in the original story, so these deductions are based on his personality and behavior.
