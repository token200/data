Based on the short story, here's a summary of Connor Schneider's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Connor appears to be a friendly and supportive individual who values meaningful relationships. He's confident in his abilities but also has a humble side, as evident when he encourages Rachel with her writing skills. He's likely a good listener and enjoys deep conversations, as seen when he and Rachel discuss their plans for the future and shared interests.

**Physical Attributes:** Connor is described as being present during the scene but not physically observed in great detail. However, based on his interaction with others and his observation of himself from the past, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Connor is likely a bit taller than Rachel, who appears to be petite. Given that he mentions watching students from his classes walk into the coffee shop, it's possible he stands around 5'10" to 6'1".
* Eye Color: His eye color isn't explicitly stated in the story, but considering his introspective nature and connection with Rachel, he might have eyes that are a warm, hazel brown or blue-green.

**Interests:** Based on Connor's conversation with Rachel, we can infer some of his interests:

* Writing: As a fan of literature and a friend to a writer, it's likely that Connor enjoys reading and writing.
* Music/Literature/Arts: His nostalgic comment about being like the students from his classes suggests he values creative expression. He might appreciate music, books, or art, possibly even photography (given his connection with Jamie, the photographer).
* Friendship/Mentorship: Connor's relationship with Rachel indicates that he values meaningful friendships and enjoys supporting others in their endeavors.

Some additional interests or traits that could be inferred from Connor's personality:

* Optimism: Despite struggling with writer's block, Connor offers Rachel a vote of confidence, suggesting he has an optimistic outlook on life.
* Self-awareness: Connor's introspection about his past self and the students around him implies that he's aware of his own growth and experiences.
