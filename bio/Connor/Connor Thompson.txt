**Personality:** Connor is a complex individual with a mix of rough edges and vulnerable spots. As the "bad boy" with a heart of gold, he has a reputation that precedes him, but beneath the surface, he's likely struggling to find his place in the world. He appears to be introverted and guarded, having grown up living in the shadow of his father's legacy. However, as he begins to open up to Dolly, it becomes clear that he's capable of deep emotional connections and is seeking a way out of his predetermined path.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, likely from years of working as a mechanic

**Interests:** As a mechanic, Connor is hands-on and practical. He seems to enjoy the quiet satisfaction of fixing something with his own two hands. His interests may also include traveling, taking on odd jobs, and exploring new places (he's been on the move for years). Additionally, he appears to have a fascination with finding ways out of small-town life, suggesting that he's drawn to freedom and self-discovery.

It's worth noting that these attributes are inferred from the short story and may not be explicitly stated. However, based on Connor's character development throughout the passage, it's possible to fill in some gaps about his personality, physical appearance, and interests.
