Here is a summary of Connor Dell's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Connor Dell appears to be a calculated and resourceful individual. He has a strong sense of self-preservation and is always on the lookout for potential threats. This trait allows him to stay one step ahead of his adversaries, but also suggests that he may have a certain level of paranoia or distrust towards others.

As someone who has been in high-stakes situations before, Connor likely has a dry wit and a tendency to be blunt with those around him. He seems confident in his abilities, but this confidence is tempered by a sense of caution and awareness of the risks involved.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height**: Connor stands at approximately 6 feet (183 cm), allowing him to maintain balance on rooftops while scanning his surroundings.
- **Eye Color**: His eyes are dark brown, which may seem like an ordinary trait but actually adds depth to his overall appearance and hints at a more intense personality.

**Interests:**

Connor's interests seem centered around survival, strategy, and high-stakes missions. As a former soldier, he likely has strong skills in combat, tactics, and hand-to-hand fighting. He is skilled in surveillance and espionage techniques as well. 

However, his profession also suggests that Connor enjoys the thrill of uncertainty and challenge associated with taking on clandestine jobs. Despite this aspect of his personality, it's less clear if he genuinely enjoys the risks involved or simply tolerates them to achieve a higher goal.

Connor appears to be driven by financial necessity rather than any altruistic desire for personal fulfillment or satisfaction.
