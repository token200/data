**Personality:** Charlie Arjona is a private investigator with a sharp mind and quick wit. She has a natural talent for gathering information and navigating complex situations, which serves her well in her line of work. However, she also has a guarded nature, having had to rely on herself for too long, making it difficult for her to open up to others easily. Despite this, there is a spark within her that makes her curious and drawn to people and mysteries.

**Physical Attributes:** Charlie Arjona stands at 5'8" with a lean yet athletic build, which suggests she is physically fit and capable of handling herself in tough situations. Her bright blue eyes are an arresting feature, sparkling with intelligence and intensity. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls to her shoulders in loose waves, often pulled back into a ponytail when she's working. She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, adding to her natural beauty.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Charlie Arjona has a keen interest in solving mysteries and uncovering hidden truths. She is naturally curious and enjoys piecing together seemingly unrelated clues to reveal the bigger picture. On a personal level, she values independence and self-reliance, having had to navigate the world on her own since childhood. Despite this, she has a soft spot for underdogs and is willing to help those in need.

In addition to her work and interests, Charlie seems to have an appreciation for mystery novels and perhaps even enjoys a good cup of coffee, as evident from her ordering one at the caf√© where she meets the enigmatic stranger.
