**Personality:** Charlie Valja is a charming and cunning individual with a sharp wit and agile hands.

Despite his checkered past, he is confident and charismatic, able to effortlessly manipulate people to get what he wants.

**Physical Attributes:**

It's worth noting that Charlie Valja's real name, Charles Valjean, has a different physical description. In Victor Hugo's novel "Les Mis√©rables," Charles Valjean is described as having a hunchback and being significantly shorter than average. However, for the purposes of this fictional character, I have created a distinct physical appearance that better fits the personality and traits described in the inspiration.
