Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Charlie Sánchez-Gijón's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Charlie is an unorthodox private investigator with a reputation for taking on cases that others deem too hot to handle. He appears to be firm and resolute in his dealings, as evidenced by his "firm despite his growing curiosity" voice when approaching Sofía. This suggests he's confident but also cautious. As the story progresses, Charlie shows determination and a willingness to take risks, solidifying his resolve to help Ana.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Charlie is not specified in terms of height, so I will make an assumption that he stands around 5'10" (178 cm) or slightly above average height for a man.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Charlie's eye color. However, considering his rugged and potentially mysterious nature, I would speculate that his eyes are likely brown or hazel, with an intensity that complements his determined personality.

**Interests:** As a private investigator in Los Angeles' Latin Quarter, Charlie is likely drawn to cases involving the underworld of crime, corruption, and danger. His willingness to take on "hot" cases indicates he's willing to push boundaries and face risks head-on. Beyond this specific case with Ana and Sofía, it's unclear what other interests or passions Charlie might have; however, his commitment to helping those in need suggests that justice and fairness are likely driving forces behind his work.

Please note that some aspects of Charlie's character remain implicit, leaving room for additional development and interpretation within future stories.
