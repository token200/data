**Personality:** Charlie has a tough exterior that he developed growing up on the streets. However, beneath this fa√ßade, he has a soft spot for those in need, particularly stray animals. He is resourceful and self-reliant, having learned to survive by his wits and fists. Despite his mysterious past, Charlie is capable of forming strong bonds with others, especially those he trusts, as seen with Sarah.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - a tall and imposing figure that commands attention.
* Eye Color: Blue - a piercing blue gaze that seems to see right through you.
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and messy, giving off an air of ruggedness.

**Interests:** Charlie is deeply connected to nature and the outdoors. He spends his days tending to his small ranch on the outskirts of town, where he has a special fondness for stray animals like Max. His love for the land and its creatures brings him a sense of peace and contentment. When not working, Charlie enjoys spending time with Sarah on the porch, watching the sunset and stargazing.

It's worth noting that while there is no mention of specific interests outside of his ranch and companionship with animals and Sarah, it can be inferred that Charlie values simplicity, solitude, and a connection to nature.
