Here is a summary of the fictional character Charlie Mäkinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Charlie Mäkinen stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender build. His hair is dark brown and usually unkempt, framing his sharp jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a depth of sadness.

**Personality:** Charlie is a introverted and analytical person who has always excelled in his work as the lead data analyst for FinFusion. He is highly intelligent, resourceful, and driven, but also struggles with emotional expression and opening up to others due to past traumas. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support them.

**Interests:** Outside of his work, Charlie enjoys exploring the city of Helsinki, particularly its design district, where he can find solace in the sleek glass facades and snow-covered buildings that reflect the pale winter sun. He also has a passion for numbers and problem-solving, often finding himself lost in complex calculations when feeling overwhelmed.

In terms of hobbies or interests beyond work, Charlie doesn't seem to have any explicitly stated activities in this story. However, it is suggested that he finds solace in spending time alone, perhaps taking walks around the city or reading (though this isn't explicitly mentioned).

**Emotional State:** After Sofia's passing, Charlie struggles with feelings of sadness and emotional numbness, which can make it difficult for him to connect with others or find meaning in his life.

Overall, Charlie Mäkinen is a complex character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are deeply influenced by his emotional state.
