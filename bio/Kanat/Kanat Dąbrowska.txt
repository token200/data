In her free time, she enjoys writing poetry, playing traditional Polish folk music on the violin, and exploring new cities and landscapes.

Now that I have a character in mind, would you like me to write a story for Kanat Dąbrowska? Please let me know what kind of story you'd like it to be (e.g., romance, mystery, adventure) and where it should take place.
