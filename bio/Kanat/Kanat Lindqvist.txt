Based on the short story, here is a summary of Kanat Lindqvist's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Kanat appears to be a creative and introspective individual who finds solace in nature. She is likely an emotional and sensitive person, given her deep connection with the frozen lake and her tendency to hold back tears when needed. Despite her vulnerability, she seems resilient and determined to find peace amidst her grief.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide explicit details about Kanat's physical appearance, except for one key fact: she is tall enough that ice skates can fit comfortably on her feet. Assuming a typical adult height range of 5'8" (173 cm) or slightly taller, we can make an educated guess. Let's say Kanat stands at around 5'9" (175 cm).

As for eye color, the story doesn't provide any specific information, but considering the author's description of her eyes being "fixed on the horizon," it's possible that she has a piercing or intense gaze, which might suggest blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** Kanat seems to be an artist at heart, with painting becoming her primary outlet for expressing emotions and finding solace. Her passion for capturing the beauty of nature is evident in her sketches and paintings, particularly the frozen lake scene that holds a special significance for her.

Her interest in ice skating as a child suggests a more adventurous and playful side to her personality, which might be balanced by her introspective nature. Overall, Kanat's artistic expression and connection with nature seem to be integral parts of her identity and solace-seeking habits.
