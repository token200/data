Here is a summary of the fictional character Mia Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Physical Attributes:** Mia stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet refined build, typical of her aristocratic upbringing. Her eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost purple in hue, which is unusual for someone of her social class but suits her creative and expressive personality. Her long, raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall, often tied up in a loose braid or adorned with small flowers and leaves to reflect her connection to nature.

**Personality:** Mia is a free-spirited and passionate individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She has a deep love for words, music, and the human experience, which drives her creative pursuits. As a poet, she is sensitive and emotional, often wearing her feelings like a badge of honor. Her confidence and conviction can sometimes make her come across as assertive or strong-willed, but those who know her understand that this is simply her inner strength shining through.

**Interests:** Mia's passions lie in poetry, music, and storytelling, with a focus on the human condition and the power of words to inspire and connect people. She is deeply fascinated by the works of Virgil, Ovid, and Homer, among others, and spends hours pouring over their verses, searching for inspiration and guidance. Her love of nature and the outdoors also plays a significant role in her art, as she often finds solace in walks through the city's gardens, parks, or along the Tiber River.

**Additional Traits:** As a member of the Roman aristocracy, Mia has been raised with etiquette and protocol, which she learned to navigate with ease. However, it is clear that these lessons do not restrict her creativity or individuality; rather, they provide a framework for her unique expression. Her ability to connect with people from all walks of life has made her a natural diplomat and mediator, skills she brings to her work as a traveling bard.

Overall, Mia Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus is a complex, multifaceted individual whose passions, creativity, and values drive her to make a meaningful impact on the world around her.
