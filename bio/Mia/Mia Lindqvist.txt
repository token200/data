**Background:**

Mia grew up in a family that valued education and storytelling. Her grandmother, who passed away when Mia was young, was a writer and a teacher who inspired Mia to explore the world of literature. She studied English literature in college and later opened "Page & Co." as a way to share her love for books with her community.

Now, as the owner of the local bookstore, Mia spends most of her days surrounded by dusty tomes and curious customers. Her passion for literature is contagious, and many have grown up with Mia as their guide through the world of words.
