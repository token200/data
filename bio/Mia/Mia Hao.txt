Here is a summary of Mia Hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mia Hao is a confident and skilled thief who operates on the edge of respectability. She is resourceful and cunning, able to think on her feet and talk her way out of sticky situations. Despite her tough exterior, she has a strong sense of self-preservation and will not hesitate to bend or break rules if it means getting the job done. However, she also has a certain code of honor that guides her actions, particularly when it comes to other thieves who may be in similar circumstances.

**Physical Attributes:** Mia stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build. Her hair is dark brown and cut short, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to gleam with mischief. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, which she obtained during one of her early thieving exploits.

**Interests:** Mia's interests lie in the world of high-stakes theft and antiquities recovery. She is fascinated by rare and valuable artifacts, particularly those with historical or cultural significance. In her free time, she enjoys reading about art history, forensic science, and cryptography - all skills that have helped her in her line of work. She is also an avid traveler, always on the lookout for new opportunities to test her skills and expand her network.

**Additional Details:** Mia's background is somewhat shrouded in mystery, but it is rumored that she came from a lower-middle-class family before turning to thievery as a means of supporting herself. She has built up a reputation as one of the best thieves in the business through her bravery, intelligence, and skill, earning respect - and sometimes envy - from her peers. Despite this, she remains fiercely independent and driven by her own motivations, rather than seeking to join any particular gang or syndicate.

It's worth noting that Lena, the young woman who confronts Mia in the alleyway, seems to be a skilled thief as well. While less is known about her background, it appears that she is younger than Mia and has a certain edge or impulsiveness that sets her apart from the more seasoned thief.
