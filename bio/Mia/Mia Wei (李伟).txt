Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mia Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mia Wei is a determined and ambitious journalist. She is driven by a strong desire to uncover the truth and expose corruption, as evident from her months-long investigation into Zhang Jian's dealings. Despite facing challenges and uncertainties, Mia remains focused and confident in her work.

However, there is also an air of caution and skepticism around her, particularly when dealing with new sources like Ling. This suggests that Mia has learned to be vigilant and discerning, especially in a profession where trust can be hard to come by.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, typical of Chinese skin

Mia appears to have an average build and an unassuming presence. She is not one to draw attention to herself, preferring to blend into the background while gathering information.

**Interests:** Mia's primary interest is investigative journalism, which drives her passion for uncovering corruption and exposing injustice. Her work as a reporter for the Shanghai Daily requires her to stay up-to-date with local politics and business news, making her well-informed on current events in Shanghai.

Outside of her work, it can be inferred that Mia enjoys reading and research, as she is always pouring over documents and conducting interviews to gather information for her stories. Her interest in investigative journalism suggests that she values truth-telling and is committed to using her skills to make a positive impact.

Some additional details that could be included:

* Mia has long, dark hair, which she often keeps tied back in a neat ponytail.
* She wears glasses perched on the end of her nose, giving her an intelligent and studious appearance.
* Mia has a fondness for traditional Chinese tea, often enjoying a cup before starting work or unwinding after a long day.

These details are purely speculative and based on my interpretation of the character.
