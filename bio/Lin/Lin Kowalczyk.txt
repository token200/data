Based on the provided story, I'll create a character summary for Lin Kowalczyk:

**Physical Attributes:**
Lin is of average height, standing at around 5'7" (170 cm). Her eye color is an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to match the intensity of her art. Her hair is a wild tangle of curly brown locks that often fall across her face when she's lost in thought.

**Personality:**
Lin is an enigmatic and introverted individual, preferring the company of her art to that of people. Despite her reclusive nature, she has a deep connection with those who appreciate her work, forming strong bonds with like-minded individuals. Her creative process is often chaotic, and she has a tendency to become completely absorbed in her art, neglecting her own needs and well-being. This intensity can be intimidating to those around her, but it's also what drives her artistic genius.

**Interests:**
Lin's interests are closely tied to her art. She spends most of her time experimenting with new techniques, exploring different mediums, and pushing the boundaries of creativity. Her passion for surrealism and abstract expressionism is unmatched, and she's always on the lookout for inspiration from mythology, nature, and personal experiences.

Additional details that can be inferred from the story:

* Lin has a strong sense of intuition and trusts her instincts when it comes to creating art.
* She's fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else.
* Despite her success in the art world, Lin remains humble and grounded, with no apparent desire for fame or fortune.
