His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His bright hazel eyes sparkle with curiosity, and his sharp jawline is accentuated by a subtle scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during an accident in the workshop.

**Personality:**
Lin Zawisza is an introverted yet intensely driven individual, fueled by an insatiable desire to learn and create. His curious nature leads him to explore unconventional paths, often challenging conventional wisdom and seeking out hidden knowledge. Despite his growing success and reputation, Lin remains humble and grounded, crediting his mentors and inspirations for his accomplishments.

**Personality Quirks:**
