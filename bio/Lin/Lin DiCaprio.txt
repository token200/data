Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Lin DiCaprio:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Age: Late 60s (with graying hair)
* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - slightly above average height
* Eye Color: Warm, honey-brown eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom and kindness

**Personality:**

* Lin is a kind-hearted and resilient individual who has faced adversity in his life. Despite the challenges he encountered as an immigrant child, he developed a strong sense of determination and perseverance.
* He is also deeply passionate about the ocean and its secrets, which drives his love for sailing and exploration.
* Lin is a romantic at heart, having fallen deeply in love with Mei and building a life together despite societal norms. This love has been a source of strength and inspiration throughout his life.

**Interests:**

* Sailing and navigation
* Oceanography and marine biology
* Learning new languages and cultures
* History and storytelling (as evident from the narrator's use of anecdotes in Lin's story)
* Music ( possibly mentioned as a source of comfort or solace in the narrative)

Please note that I've taken creative liberties to flesh out the character profile, making it more detailed and engaging. The original short story served as inspiration, but the fictional character "Lin DiCaprio" is entirely new and not based on Leonardo DiCaprio.
