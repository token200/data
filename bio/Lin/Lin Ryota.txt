Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Lin Ryota's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lin Ryota is a skilled and fearless operative who is driven by a strong sense of justice. Her past experiences have left her with a deep-seated desire for vengeance, but she now channels this energy into protecting the innocent and bringing down those responsible for corruption. She is a natural leader, confident in her abilities and unafraid to take risks. Ryota's training has honed her instincts, allowing her to stay one step ahead of her enemies.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 5'8" (172 cm)
* **Weight:** Lean and athletic build, weighing around 130-140 lbs (59-64 kg)
* **Eye Color:** Piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she encounters

Ryota's physical attributes suggest a wiry and agile individual, capable of moving with stealth and precision. Her height and lean build allow her to navigate through tight spaces and evade danger.

**Interests:** Lin Ryota's interests are centered around her work as an operative for the Special Forces Unit "Nightshade". She is deeply invested in uncovering truth and bringing down those responsible for corruption and crime. Outside of her work, it can be assumed that Ryota has a strong interest in staying physically fit and honing her skills to maintain her edge as a deadly operative.

However, since there isn't any information about Ryota's interests outside of work in the provided text I added them:

*   In her free time Ryota enjoys practicing martial arts. The emphasis on discipline and control is similar to what she experiences with her work. It allows her to relieve stress while also improving her focus.
*   She has a weakness for traditional Japanese food and tea, often treating herself to quiet evenings in her small Tokyo apartment after long missions.
