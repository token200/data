Lin García Márquez has an athletic build and stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face. Her bright hazel eyes seem to sparkle with curiosity, and her full lips curve into a warm smile when she's happy. She has a small tattoo of a sun on her left ankle and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

Lin is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who lives life on her own terms. She's fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Despite this, she has a compassionate side and is always willing to lend a listening ear or a helping hand to those in need. Lin is intensely curious and loves to learn new things, often finding herself lost in the pages of books on various subjects, from history to science to philosophy.
