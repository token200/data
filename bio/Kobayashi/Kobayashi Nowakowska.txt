She stands at approximately 5'8" (172 cm) with an slender yet athletic build, typical of someone who spends most of their day on their feet examining artifacts. Her dark brown eyes are intense and focused, a testament to her sharp intellect and curiosity. Her raven-black hair is often styled in a neat bob, framing her heart-shaped face and accentuating her high cheekbones.

**Personality:**
Kobayashi Nowakowska is an introverted yet fiercely determined individual with a passion for the unknown. She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her, but beneath this exterior lies a deep-seated love for discovery and uncovering secrets from history's past. Her intense focus on her work often leads to long hours spent researching and verifying authenticity, which can make her appear detached or disinterested to others.

**Interests:**
Kobayashi Nowakowska has a fascination with the obscure and unknown, particularly when it comes to ancient artifacts and relics from forgotten eras. She spends most of her free time reading about historical texts, attending archaeological lectures, and scouring museums for hidden treasures. Her interests extend beyond art and history, as she is also an avid fan of mythology, folklore, and cryptography. Despite the controversy surrounding her discovery, Kobayashi Nowakowska remains committed to uncovering the truth behind ancient artifacts and sharing her knowledge with others.

As a curator at the Tokyo Museum of Antiquities, she has developed a keen eye for spotting hidden patterns and anomalies in artifacts, making her one of the most sought-after experts in the field.

The rumors of fabrication by a rival curator, however, have shaken Kobayashi Nowakowska's confidence in her own abilities, leaving her even more determined than ever to prove the authenticity of her discovery and restore her reputation.
