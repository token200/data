**Background:**

Kobayashi Zariņš hails from a small village in Eastern Europe, where he was raised by his parents, who were both scholars and collectors. He showed a keen interest in history and archaeology from a young age and spent many years studying and traveling the world to acquire rare artifacts for his collection.

As he grew older, Kobayashi Zariņš became increasingly disillusioned with the academic community and the commercialization of his field. He struck out on his own, becoming a freelance collector and curator who takes on high-risk missions to retrieve rare artifacts from around the world.

Despite his tough exterior, Kobayashi Zariņš has a deep sense of vulnerability and is haunted by a tragic event in his past that drives him to seek out new challenges and opportunities.
