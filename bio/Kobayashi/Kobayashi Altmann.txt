Based on the short story "The Art of Deception" about Kobayashi Yakumo from the Lupin III manga series, I'll create a summary for a fictional character named Kobayashi Altmann.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, almost piercing green when looking at something he's passionate about
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey fashion

**Personality:**
Kobayashi Altmann is a charismatic and resourceful individual with an insatiable curiosity for art, history, and human behavior. He has a quick wit and an easy smile, which allows him to effortlessly navigate complex situations. Despite his charming exterior, Altmann is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries.

**Interests:**

* Art (museum heists, forgery, and restoration)
* History (specifically, the history of art and its connection to politics, power struggles, and cultural movements)
* Human behavior (understanding people's motivations, desires, and flaws)
* Traveling and exploring new places
* Reading literature (classics, contemporary fiction, and non-fiction books on various subjects)

**Background:**
Kobayashi Altmann is a skilled art historian-turned-thief with an affinity for the rare and the obscure. He has spent years honing his expertise in art appreciation, forgery detection, and museum security systems. With his sharp mind, quick thinking, and natural charm, he's built a reputation as a master thief, always staying one step ahead of his marks.

If you'd like me to write a story featuring Kobayashi Altmann instead of Kobayashi Yakumo, I'd be happy to give it a try!
