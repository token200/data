Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Kobayashi Kiss:

**Name:** Kobayashi Kiss (no relation to the Japanese phrase meaning "a kiss from someone's mouth")

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm, hazel brown eyes with golden flecks
* Hair: Long, curly dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned complexion with a subtle glow from spending time outdoors

**Personality:**

Kobayashi Kiss is a free-spirited and creative individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She's a hopeless romantic, always chasing her passions and living life to the fullest. Despite her bold exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs, stray animals, and causes that need a helping hand.

**Interests:**

* Art (painting, murals, street art)
* Music (plays the guitar and writes her own songs)
* Travel (loves exploring new cities and experiencing different cultures)
* Animal welfare ( volunteers at local animal shelters and advocates for stray animal rights)
* Environmentalism (dedicated to reducing waste and promoting eco-friendly practices)

**Additional Details:**

Kobayashi Kiss is a talented artist who has gained recognition for her vibrant murals in the city. She's often spotted with her trusty terrier mix companion, whom she rescued from an abandoned warehouse. When not creating art or advocating for social causes, she can be found strumming her guitar at local cafes or sipping coffee at a quirky bookstore.
