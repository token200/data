Kobayashi Meltin' Mel is an adventurous and curious individual with a passion for exploration. He's confident in his shape-shifting abilities, which makes him feel invincible when traversing the galaxy. Mel has a childlike enthusiasm that sometimes gets him into trouble, but it also allows him to approach challenges with creativity and resilience.

Despite being made of liquid metal, Mel is surprisingly empathetic and understanding. He quickly forms close bonds with those he meets, including Space Dandy and QT, whom he considers friends. His unique abilities make him a natural problem solver, and he's always eager to share his knowledge and expertise with others.

Mel is also deeply introspective, often questioning his own identity and purpose. Through his journey with Space Dandy and QT, he develops a stronger sense of self and finds meaning in his exploration of the galaxy.
