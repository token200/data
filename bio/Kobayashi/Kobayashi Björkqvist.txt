In terms of hobbies or pastimes, Björkqvist enjoys collecting rare and unusual natural materials for his performances – an old gourd shell here, a strand of spider silk there. He is also an avid traveler, always seeking new places to perform and meet fellow artists who can share in his passion for "Björkspiel."
