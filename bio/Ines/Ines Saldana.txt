Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ines Saldana, I'll create a character profile inspired by Zoe Saldana, with similar name and some physical attributes. Here's a summary:

**Physical Attributes:**
Inez Saldana (Zoe Saldana-inspired) is of Latin American descent, with dark brown eyes and long, curly dark hair. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to move effortlessly between her artistic pursuits and the bustling streets of New York City.

Her love for Frida Kahlo's artistic philosophy and unapologetic style continues to inspire her, guiding her creative path.

**Additional Details:**
