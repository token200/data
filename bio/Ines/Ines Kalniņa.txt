**Interests:**

Ines Kalniņa is deeply passionate about sailing and exploration. She has spent years charting the unknown waters of the Baltic Sea, driven by a desire for discovery and an insatiable curiosity about the natural world. Her love for navigation, linguistics (as suggested by her grandfather's teaching), and oceanography (implied through her pursuit of secrets in the sea) are evident in her journey as a sailor and explorer.

Beyond sailing and exploration, Ines seems to value solitude and quiet contemplation. She finds peace in stillness, perhaps even more so than she values excitement or discovery. This combination suggests that while adventure is an integral part of who she is, it's not the only aspect of life that brings her fulfillment.
