Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ines Sundlof's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ines appears to be a free-spirited and adventurous person who has been drawn to the ocean since childhood. She is introspective and contemplative, often seeking solace in nature and reminiscing about her grandfather's stories. As an adult, she seems to have found a sense of contentment in her quiet life as a librarian, but the presence of her grandfather's words stirs up a restlessness within her, hinting at a deeper desire for exploration and connection with the natural world.

**Physical Attributes:** Ines is likely to be a tall and slender person, given her ability to stand alone on the edge of the fjord. Her exact height is not mentioned, but based on the description of her standing against the wind and feeling small yet connected to the vastness of nature, she may be someone who carries herself with a quiet confidence.

As for her eye color, it's difficult to determine from the text alone, but I would imagine her eyes to be a deep blue or gray, reflecting the ocean's colors. Her hair, which is whipping in the wind, suggests that it may be long and flowing, perhaps reaching down to her waist or longer.

**Interests:** Ines' love for the ocean and sailing is evident, as she feels a sense of restlessness when away from its presence. She has an appreciation for stories, particularly those passed down through generations, and values the wisdom imparted by her grandfather. As a librarian, she likely enjoys reading and sharing tales with others, but her true passion lies in connecting with nature and surrendering to its wild beauty.

Overall, Ines appears to be a person who is deeply connected to the natural world and has a rich inner life. Her experiences have shaped her into someone who values introspection, storytelling, and the quiet moments of contemplation that come from being near water.
