Based on the inspiration from Inés de la Fressange's character, I will create a fictional summary for the character Ines De Rossi:

**Name:** Ines De Rossi

**Height:** 5'8" (172 cm) - tall and slender with an athletic build.

Her passion for life is contagious, making those around her feel inspired to chase their dreams.
