Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ines Valerius Aurelius Constantinus' (Iver) personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Iver is a man of unyielding conviction and unwavering principle. He is driven by an insatiable curiosity for knowledge and a strong sense of justice. He is a natural leader with natural charisma and eloquence, able to inspire others through his impassioned speeches. Despite his many accomplishments, Iver remains humble and unassuming, living modestly and surrounding himself with close friends and advisors who share his values.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown
- Hair Color: Jet black

I've assumed the height based on typical Roman male stature during that era. The eye color is dark brown, common in ancient Rome, and the hair color is jet black, typical for men of his social class.

**Interests:**
Iver's primary interests include:
1. Philosophy: He spends countless hours reading about philosophy, devouring texts on various subjects.
2. Law: Iver has a deep understanding of law and politics, often using his knowledge to argue on behalf of the oppressed.
3. Politics: As a prominent figure in Roman intellectual circles, Iver is deeply involved in shaping policy and promoting reform.

I've made these assumptions based on the information provided in the short story, filling in any gaps with general knowledge about ancient Rome and its culture.
