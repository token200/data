Based on the provided information about Zoe Saldana, I have created a fictional profile for Kiara Saldana:

Physical Attributes:
Kiara Saldana is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with an athletic build. Her eyes are a warm hazel color, often described as a combination of brown and green. She has long, dark hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her skin tone is olive with subtle golden undertones, a testament to her mixed heritage.

Personality:
Kiara Saldana is known for her sharp wit and infectious smile. As an actress, she exudes confidence and vulnerability simultaneously, making her performances all the more captivating. Off-screen, Kiara is fiercely independent and determined, never afraid to take risks or challenge the status quo. Her creativity and passion drive her, whether it's through acting, advocacy, or her personal interests.

Interests:
Kiara Saldana has a deep love for art, music, and science. She's an avid painter and sketch artist, often using her creative outlets to express herself outside of acting roles. Music is another one of her passions; she plays the guitar and has even released her own indie music album under a pseudonym. Her interest in science spans from astrophysics to environmental studies, which fuels her advocacy for social justice and sustainability.

While Kiara may share some similarities with Zoe Saldana, this fictional profile aims to create a unique character that is not meant to be confused with the actress.
