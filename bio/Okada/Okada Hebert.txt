Based on the brief character profile and the short story, I've created a comprehensive character profile for Okada Hebert:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8"
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Jet black, often worn in a messy bob
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, with toned arms from years of rock climbing and parkour training

**Personality:**
Okada Hebert is a determined and resourceful individual who has learned to rely on herself in order to survive. Growing up as an orphan, she had to navigate the streets and make ends meet, teaching her the importance of self-reliance and adaptability. Her fiercely independent nature makes it difficult for her to accept help from others, but once she trusts someone, she will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Interests:**

* Investigative journalism: Hebert's passion for uncovering the truth drives her to take risks and push boundaries in order to expose corruption.
* Rock climbing and parkour: These sports provide Hebert with a sense of freedom and thrill-seeking adventure, helping her to clear her mind and focus on her investigations.
* Hiking and camping: When she's not in the city, Hebert loves to escape into nature, finding solace in the peace and quiet of the wilderness.

**Skills:**

* Investigative journalism
* Rock climbing and parkour training
* Basic self-defense techniques
* Proficient in multiple languages (including Japanese, English, and some basic proficiency in French)

Hebert's years as a freelance journalist have taught her to be resourceful and quick-thinking, always looking for ways to stay one step ahead of her sources. Her sharp instincts and determination make her a formidable force when pursuing a story, and those who underestimate her do so at their own peril.
