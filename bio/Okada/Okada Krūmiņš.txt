Here's a summary of Okada Krūmiņš' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - with an slightly lean build
* Eye Color: Bright blue - reminiscent of a clear summer sky in Latvia
* Hair: Pink - dyed bright pink, often styled in messy, tousled locks that add to his eccentric appearance
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a collection of scars and scratches on his hands from years of tinkering

**Personality:**

Okada is an eccentric inventor who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's fiercely passionate about machines and the possibilities they hold, often getting lost in his own little world of gears, wires, and mirrors. Despite his somewhat unpredictable nature, he has a quick wit and can be charming when he wants to be.

However, as Okada delves deeper into his work, his dedication can sometimes border on obsession, leading him to neglect the needs of those around him. He's also intensely introspective, often plagued by self-doubt and the fear that his creations may not be worthy of the world.

**Interests:**

Okada's primary interest lies in inventing and tinkering with machines. He's always been fascinated by how things work, from the intricacies of clockwork mechanisms to the raw power of steam engines. His inventions are often unorthodox and impractical, but they hold a certain allure that draws people to him.

Aside from his love of machinery, Okada is also an avid reader of scientific texts and philosophy books, devouring knowledge on topics ranging from quantum physics to Renaissance-era art movements. He's particularly drawn to the works of inventors like Nikola Tesla and Leonardo da Vinci, whose innovative spirit and relentless pursuit of progress inspire him.

In his free time, Okada enjoys taking long walks along the Daugava River, observing the way the light reflects off the water's surface, and listening to the sound of the city coming alive in the evenings.
