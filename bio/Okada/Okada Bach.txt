He collects antique dolls and yellowed photographs, which he sees as artifacts of the human experience that reveal insights into our collective psyche. His fascination with these objects often leads him to draw parallels between past and present, revealing unexpected connections between seemingly disparate aspects of human culture.

**Hobbies:** Due to his reclusive nature, Okada Bach's hobbies are largely solitary pursuits that allow him to focus on his intellectual interests.
