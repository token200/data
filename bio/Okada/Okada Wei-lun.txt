Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Okada Wei-lun's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wei-lun is a complex individual who has struggled to reconcile his past and present selves. He appears to be introverted, lost in thought, and nostalgic, as evident from his behavior in the café. However, when Mei-Ling arrives, his demeanor changes, and he becomes more expressive and emotive. This suggests that Wei-lun is capable of deep feelings and connections with others, particularly those who see beyond his façade.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no detailed physical attributes are provided in the short story. To fill this gap, let's assume the following:

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, possibly almost black

**Interests:** Based on Wei-lun's background as an ex-con artist and his current introspective state, it is likely that he has interests related to self-discovery, personal growth, and potentially, spirituality or philosophy. The fact that Mei-Ling's presence reignites his passion for life suggests that he values meaningful relationships and experiences.

It's also worth noting that Wei-lun's interest in art might not be explicitly stated in the story, but given his background as an artist, it is possible that he has a creative outlet or hobby. Additionally, his connection with Mei-Ling implies that he values human connections and may be interested in social justice or advocacy work.

Please keep in mind that these details are speculative and based on the provided short story.
