Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Okada Salamanca:

**Personality:**
Okada Salamanca is known for his unyielding ambition, strategic mind, and mastery of manipulation. He is confident, calculating, and detached, always thinking several steps ahead of his opponents. His ability to read people's body language and signals allows him to make calculated risks, leading to massive rewards. Despite his cold exterior, he seems to be driven by a deep-seated drive for success, no matter the cost.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark Brown with hints of gold

As described in the short story, Okada Salamanca's eyes are a key aspect of his persona. They seem to hold an air of quiet confidence and intensity, allowing him to size up his opponents and manipulate them with ease.

**Interests:**
It is clear that poker is Okada Salamanca's passion and area of expertise. He has spent years honing his skills on the streets of Tokyo, playing makeshift games for scraps and cash, and later rising to become a fixture on the international poker circuit. His focus on winning and outmaneuvering his opponents suggests that he has no interest in anything else.

However, one can speculate that Okada Salamanca's fascination with power, control, and strategy might be driven by an innate desire for self-improvement and competition. He seems to enjoy pushing himself against the best of the best, always seeking to improve his skills and expand his knowledge.

It is also possible that Okada Salamanca has a side interest or hobby outside of poker, something that allows him to unwind and relax when he's not on the table. However, this detail is left unexplored in the short story, leaving it to the reader's imagination.
