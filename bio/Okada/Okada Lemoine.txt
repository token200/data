Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Okada Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Okada (or Kay) is a free-spirited and determined individual who values self-expression and independence. She has a strong sense of confidence and is not afraid to take risks. Having experienced the suffocating expectations of her traditional family in Tokyo, she has developed a need for autonomy and freedom. Despite this, she is still deeply passionate about art and music, and is eager to make a name for herself in Paris.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Black, straight, and shoulder-length

These physical attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the story, but they can be inferred based on Kay's personality and background. As a Japanese-American expat, she may have inherited her dark hair color from her Asian heritage.

**Interests:** Okada is a talented painter and violinist who is passionate about art and music. She has always been drawn to "Western" art, which was not accepted by her traditional family in Tokyo. Her interests are centered around self-expression and creativity, and she sees Paris as the perfect place to pursue her dreams.

It's worth noting that Sophie's gift of a wooden violin case to Kay suggests that Okada is also skilled at crafting beautiful objects with her hands, possibly indicating a connection to woodworking or other crafts.
