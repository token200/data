Despite his years of experience as a detective turned private investigator, he remains fiercely independent and driven by a strong sense of justice.

He is empathetic and genuinely cares about the people who come into his life, often putting their needs before his own. This empathetic nature makes him an excellent advocate for those who are being victimized or oppressed.

Outside of work, Juris enjoys taking long walks along the beach or hiking through the mountains to clear his mind. He also has a passion for reading, particularly true crime novels, which helps him stay up-to-date on the latest developments in his field.

When he's not working, Juris can be found playing guitar and writing music - this is one of his few creative outlets where he feels truly free to express himself.
