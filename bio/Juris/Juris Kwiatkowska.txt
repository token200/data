Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Juris Kwiatkowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Juris is a brilliant but reclusive mathematician known for his unorthodox approach to problem-solving. Despite his reputation as a maverick, he has a strong sense of insecurity and self-doubt, which can be overwhelming at times. However, with the help of the mysterious wooden box and its hidden equation, Juris gains newfound confidence and clarity in his work.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, almost piercing
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often unkempt and tousled from days spent in the laboratory
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a slightly gaunt appearance that belies his razor-sharp mind

**Interests:** Juris is deeply passionate about mathematics, particularly fractal geometry. He spends most of his time studying and experimenting with complex equations and theories, often neglecting his own well-being in the process.

When he's not working on his research, Juris has a fascination for symbols and codes that seems to be both an intellectual curiosity and a deep emotional connection. The intricate wooden box on his nightstand is just one example of this interest, hinting at a broader fascination with hidden patterns and secrets waiting to be uncovered in the universe.

Juris's love of mathematics and codes also hints at a more intuitive side of his personality, suggesting that he may have a strong connection to abstract concepts and higher-dimensional realities.
