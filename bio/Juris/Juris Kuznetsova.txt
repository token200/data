Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Juris Kuznetsova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Juris appears to be a determined and driven individual, with a strong passion for uncovering hidden histories. She seems to be fiercely independent and willing to take risks to uncover the truth, as evident from her willingness to "do whatever it takes" to find out about the Kozlov family secrets. Her curiosity and enthusiasm suggest that she is highly intelligent and resourceful.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no details provided about Juris's physical appearance in the short story. However, I can make an educated guess based on her profession as an archivist. Perhaps she has a somewhat bookish or academic demeanor, with perhaps glasses perched on the end of her nose and a neat, organized sense of style.

**Height:** It is difficult to estimate Juris's height without additional information, but based on the description of her interactions with the local elder, I would imagine that she is likely around 5'8" (173 cm) or slightly shorter. This would give her an unobtrusive presence, allowing her to blend into the village and observe its inhabitants.

**Eye Color:** The story doesn't provide specific details about Juris's eye color, but based on her determined expression and sharp features, I would imagine that she has bright, piercing eyes - perhaps blue or green in hue. These colors suggest intelligence, intensity, and a strong will to uncover the truth.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Juris is deeply interested in uncovering hidden histories, particularly those related to the Kozlov family. Her work as an archivist suggests that she is well-versed in research methods, historical analysis, and critical thinking. She appears to be fascinated by the mysteries surrounding her great-grandmother's past life as a village healer, and is willing to dig deep into the secrets of the Kozlov family to uncover the truth.
