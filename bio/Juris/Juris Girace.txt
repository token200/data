Here's a summary of Juris Girace's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Juris Girace is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, he appears to be ruthless, determined, and fiercely loyal to those he cares about. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep-seated vulnerability and a desire for redemption. As revealed in his relationship with Francesca, Juris has a capacity for love and compassion that is slowly uncovered as he navigates the consequences of his past actions.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Build: Muscular and imposing, with a wiry physique honed from years of physical labor and combat training.
* Face: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Juris's interests are largely centered around his love for whiskey and women. As revealed in the story, these vices became all-consuming at times, masking a deeper sense of emptiness and disconnection from the world around him. However, after meeting Francesca, his perspective began to shift, and he started to find solace in quieter pursuits, such as spending time with those he loves.

In contrast to his life on the streets, Juris has no discernible hobbies or passions outside of his relationship with Francesca. He seems to have found a sense of purpose in the quiet moments they share together, sipping whiskey and enjoying each other's company.

It is worth noting that as Juris navigates his new life beyond organized crime, we can assume that he may explore new interests and hobbies, such as gardening or painting, but for now these are largely unknown.
