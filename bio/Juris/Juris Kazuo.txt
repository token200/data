This willingness to challenge authority and push boundaries makes him a magnet for sources willing to take risks.

Outside of his work as a journalist, Juris enjoys a good whiskey (often sipped in dimly lit bars like the one where he first encountered the hooded figure), reading books on history, philosophy, and psychology, and engaging in late-night debates with fellow intellectuals over cigars and fine wine.

In his investigation into the ancient cult, Juris's interests have evolved to include deciphering cryptic symbols, tracing historical threads, and analyzing the psychological motivations behind human behavior â€“ a testament to his driven personality and willingness to question everything he thought he knew about himself.
