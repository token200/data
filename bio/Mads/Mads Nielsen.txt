Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mads Nielsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Mads Nielsen appears to be a creative and passionate individual who has lost touch with his artistic identity due to the pressures of real-world responsibilities. He seems introverted and struggling with self-doubt, but also fiercely determined to pursue his dreams. His friendship with Sofia suggests that he values loyalty and support from close relationships.

Physical Attributes: 

- Height: Mads is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, given the context of having graduated from art school. However, without explicit information about his height, it's difficult to estimate precisely.
  
- Eye Color: The story doesn't explicitly mention Mads' eye color, so I will assume it is blue, as blue eyes are commonly associated with European or Scandinavian features (consistent with Mads being Danish).

Interests:

- Art: This is the most obvious interest of Mads Nielsen. He has a deep passion for art and uses it to express himself.
- Urban Exploration: Mads finds beauty in abandoned and overlooked places within cities, indicating an appreciation for the unique qualities found in these areas.
- Architecture: As Sofia's profession, she seems to have an influence on his ideas and designs, suggesting that Mads may appreciate or be interested in architecture as well.

Mads' interests revolve around finding beauty in unexpected places and utilizing his creative skills to express himself.
