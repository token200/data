Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mads Esposito's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mads is a cautious and resourceful individual with a strong sense of unease when faced with unfamiliar or potentially threatening situations. As a former soldier, he has experience in combat zones and has developed a keen instinct for survival. Despite his tough exterior, there is a hint of vulnerability and curiosity about him, which suggests that he may be open to new experiences and connections.

**Physical Attributes:** Mads is likely a ruggedly handsome individual with a strong build, given his military background. He is probably around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with short to medium-length brown hair and hazel or blue-gray eyes. His height and physical presence suggest that he commands respect without drawing attention to himself.

**Interests:** Given Mads's background as a former soldier, it can be inferred that his interests lie in adventure, survival, and possibly even treasure hunting or retrieval. He may also have an interest in history, particularly when it comes to ancient artifacts and lost civilizations. The fact that he is hired to retrieve an artifact from the depths of the forest suggests that Mads is drawn to challenges and puzzles that require skill and strategy to solve.

Additionally, Mads's encounter with the mysterious woman raises questions about his personal life and motivations. Is he a private person who prefers to keep to himself, or does he have a network of contacts and allies? What drives him beyond financial gain (although this is a significant motivator for him)? These unanswered questions add complexity to Mads's character and invite further exploration.

Overall, Mads Esposito appears to be a complex and multifaceted individual with a mix of military discipline, curiosity, and adventure-seeking spirit.
