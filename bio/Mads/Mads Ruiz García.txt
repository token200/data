Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Mads Ruiz García:

**Personality:** Mads appears to be a introspective and thoughtful individual. He is drawn to the stillness of night, which suggests that he values quiet contemplation and may be someone who prefers to observe rather than act impulsively. His love of art, history, and photography indicates that he is creative and curious, with a deep appreciation for the nuances of his subject matter.

Despite his passion for his work, Mads seems to struggle with fitting into his family's legacy, which suggests that he may be an outsider looking in. However, this sense of disconnection also appears to drive him, fueling his desire to uncover hidden symbols and codes in his images.

**Physical Attributes:** Mads' height is not specified, but based on the text, it can be inferred that he is likely a bit above average. His eye color is not mentioned either, but considering his appreciation for the dimly lit streets of Paris, it's possible that he has dark or blue eyes that are more suited to observing the world at night.

**Interests:** Mads' primary interest is photography, which is an art form that allows him to capture moments in time and convey his vision to others. He seems to be particularly drawn to documenting the beauty and decay of cities, which suggests that he has a strong appreciation for urban landscapes and the people who inhabit them.

In addition to his love of photography, Mads appears to have a deep interest in art, history, and culture, particularly Spanish cinema and the works of Gaudí. He also seems to be fascinated by codes and symbols, which may indicate that he has an analytical mind or is simply drawn to puzzles and mysteries.

Outside of his work, Mads values quiet contemplation and memory, as evidenced by his desire to revisit his father's old studio and relive fond memories of his childhood. This suggests that he places a strong emphasis on personal connection and heritage.
