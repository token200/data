Gaia Jarv is a gentle soul with a deep connection to the earth and its rhythms. She has a calming presence that puts those around her at ease, making her an beloved figure in Willow Creek. Despite her quiet nature, she's fiercely determined and resourceful when it comes to protecting her community and the natural world. Her empathetic heart and intuitive understanding of the plant kingdom make her a skilled listener and problem-solver.

**Interests:**

* Baking (of course!) - Gaia's passion for creating sweet treats is rivaled only by her love of working with plants.
* Herbalism and apothecary - She spends countless hours researching, experimenting, and perfecting recipes that harness the healing properties of nature.
