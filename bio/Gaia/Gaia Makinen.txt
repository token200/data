Based on the short story, here is a summary of Gaia Makinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Gaia is a brave, determined, and fiercely loyal individual. She has channeled her past pain into a strong sense of justice and protection for her people and territory. Her experience in survival and combat has given her a sense of resilience and adaptability. Despite the weight of her losses, she remains focused on her mission to protect others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Ice blue, with a hint of silver that seems almost otherworldly in the right light
* Hair: Dark brown and straight, often tied back in a practical braid or ponytail for battle

**Interests:** Gaia's interests revolve around her duties as a warrior and protector of her people. She is skilled in combat, spear-wielding, and tracking, and has honed these skills through years of training and experience in the harsh tundras of the north. While she may not have much time for leisure activities, she likely enjoys spending time outdoors, hunting, and exploring the wilderness with her fellow Kaelin warriors.

In terms of personal interests outside of combat and duty, little is revealed about Gaia's thoughts, feelings, or desires beyond her mission to protect her people and land. She seems driven by a strong sense of purpose and loyalty, rather than personal ambition or desire for wealth or status.
