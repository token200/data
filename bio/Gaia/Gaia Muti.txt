She is particularly drawn to mysteries that lie beyond human comprehension, often finding solace in the unfathomable power that resides within the unknown realms.

Despite her imposing presence, Gaia has a quiet sense of curiosity and a deep respect for the complexities of the universe – she recognizes that some secrets are too great for mortal minds to grasp.
