**Personality:** Emi is a complex individual with a tough exterior and a soft spot for stray animals and children. He has a habit of being on high alert, always expecting someone to be lurking in the shadows, which suggests that he remains sharp and vigilant even after leaving his past life as an assassin and spy behind. Despite this, he also has a gentle demeanor and enjoys volunteering at local charities.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn short and neatly trimmed

**Interests:** Emi is an avid gardener and takes great pride in his green thumb. He also enjoys fixing things around the house, walking dogs, and participating in charity events.
