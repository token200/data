Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Grzegorz Kaleja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Grzegorz Kaleja is introspective and melancholic, often lost in thought as he reflects on his life's journey. He appears to be haunted by self-doubt, struggling to come to terms with the fact that football wasn't enough for him. This introspection suggests that he is a thoughtful and possibly introverted person.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific physical attributes are described in the story, except for his height (unspecified) and eye color (no description). However, considering his age as a former professional footballer, it's possible to make an educated guess. Given his age, he likely has a tall stature typical of many professional athletes, with a rugged yet worn appearance due to years of playing the sport.

**Interests:** Grzegorz Kaleja's primary interest is football (soccer), which dominates his life until his career forces him to reevaluate his priorities. He had also joined the Polish national team, suggesting that he values national pride and possibly has a strong sense of patriotism. However, after walking away from football, it seems he has lost interest in the sport and its related activities.

It's worth noting that Grzegorz Kaleja seems uninterested in other aspects of his life outside of football, which raises questions about what sparked this new era of introspection.
