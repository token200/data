Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Grzegorz HÃ©bert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Grzegorz is a sharp-minded detective with a reputation for being one of the best in the business. He has a keen eye for detail and is fiercely intelligent, which makes him an invaluable asset to the Warsaw Police Department. However, he also has a tendency to be reckless and impulsive, often leaping into action without thinking through the consequences. This trait sometimes gets him into trouble, but it also allows him to solve cases that others might have missed.

**Physical Attributes:** Grzegorz is likely of average height for a Polish male, standing around 5'10" (178 cm) tall. His eye color is likely brown or hazel, with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he questions. He has short, dark hair and a strong jawline, giving him a rugged yet intelligent appearance.

**Interests:** Grzegorz's primary interest is solving complex cases and unraveling mysteries. He is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged. Outside of work, he may enjoy activities that allow him to exercise his mind and relax, such as reading, playing chess, or practicing yoga. However, given his intense focus on his work, it's unclear if he has much time for hobbies or leisure activities.

It's worth noting that Grzegorz seems to be a bit of an introvert, preferring to spend his free time alone or engaged in intellectual pursuits rather than socializing with others. Despite this, he is deeply committed to his work and will go to great lengths to solve a case, even if it means sacrificing his own well-being.
