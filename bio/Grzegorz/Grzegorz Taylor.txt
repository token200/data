He is haunted by the loss of his passion for music and feels stuck in a monotony-filled life. Despite this, he has a deep-seated desire to create and connect with others through music. As revealed by his impromptu jam session, Grzegorz is also a resilient and determined individual who can tap into his inner spark when given the opportunity.
