**Personality:** Merike is an introverted and enigmatic individual with a dry wit and sharp tongue. She has a reputation for being elusive and guarded, preferring to keep to herself rather than engaging with others on a superficial level. Despite this, she possesses a keen insight into human nature and is drawn to complex, thought-provoking ideas. Her passion for art and philosophy makes her intensely curious, and she has a knack for finding the underlying truths in people and situations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle golden glow
* Build: Slender yet athletic, with toned arms and shoulders from years of typing away on her laptop

**Interests:** Merike is an art aficionado with a deep appreciation for avant-garde and experimental works. She is also fascinated by philosophy, psychology, and the human condition. Her interests extend to literature, music, and poetry, particularly those that explore themes of identity, morality, and the complexities of human nature.

In her free time, Merike enjoys writing reviews and articles about art, attending underground exhibitions, and engaging in lively debates with fellow intellectuals over coffee or wine. She is a voracious reader and has a vast collection of books on philosophy, psychology, and art history.

Despite her love for the arts, Merike's fascination with Marcello and their mysterious encounter leaves her wondering if there's more to life than the familiar walls of her own world.
