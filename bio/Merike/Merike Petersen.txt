Here's a summary of Merike Petersen's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Merike is known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, which have earned her a reputation as one of the most incisive voices in the literary scene. She is confident and outspoken, but also has a vulnerable side that she only reveals to those closest to her. Despite her success, she has become increasingly disillusioned with the art world, leading her to question her own motivations and values.

**Physical Attributes:** Merike is likely a petite woman, given the description of her running into Lena at a "dingy caf√©" in the outskirts of town, where the atmosphere seems intimate and informal. She might have curly brown hair (given the mention of her friend's "eclectic trinkets") and warm, expressive eyes that sparkle with intensity when she discusses topics that matter to her.

**Height:** Around 5'4"-5'6" (162 cm-168 cm), which is slightly below average height but belies her sharp intellect and strong personality.

**Interests:** Merike has always been passionate about writing and storytelling, initially as a way to express herself and share her emotions with others. She finds solace in the written word and uses it as a means to connect with readers on a deeper level. Her interests may include:

* Writing short stories, poetry, and articles
* Reading a wide range of literature, particularly works that explore the human condition and social justice issues
* Attending art exhibitions and concerts to experience different forms of creative expression
* Conversing with artists, writers, and intellectuals to learn from their experiences and insights

Over time, Merike has also become fascinated by the intersection of art and society, exploring how creativity can be used as a tool for social change and personal growth.
