Here is a summary of Merike Mäkinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Merike Mäkinen is a complex and introspective individual with a deep affinity for the darker corners of life. She is drawn to the unknown and has an insatiable curiosity about the supernatural. Her fascination with the paranormal drives her to explore the unexplained and often puts her at odds with those who don't share her interests. Despite this, she remains fiercely independent and passionate about uncovering the secrets that lie beyond the veil of reality.

**Physical Attributes:** Merike is a tall and slender woman in her mid-twenties, standing at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet ethereal build. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to gleam with an otherworldly intensity when she's discussing the supernatural or engaging in séances. Her dark hair is often tied up in a loose bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.

**Interests:** Merike's primary interests revolve around the paranormal and the supernatural. She spends countless hours researching ancient spirits like the Finnish vila, studying dusty tomes on mythology and folklore, and attending séances in dingy backrooms. Her love for the unknown often leads her on solo explorations of Helsinki's Old Town, where she searches for hidden secrets and whispers from the other side.

Merike's interest in the supernatural extends beyond mere curiosity; it also reflects a deep-seated desire to understand the mysteries that surround human existence. She believes that the veil between worlds is thinning, and that by delving into the unknown, she can uncover the truth about her ancestors' spirits, the city of Helsinki itself, and the world around her.

As a result, Merike has become an accomplished practitioner of various forms of mysticism and spiritualism, able to communicate with the other side in ways that few others can. Her experiences have also led her to develop a sense of intuition and empathy, allowing her to navigate the gray areas between reality and the supernatural with uncanny ease.
