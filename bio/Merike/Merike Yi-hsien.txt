Based on the provided short story, I've created a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Merike Yi-hsien:

**Personality:** Merike appears to be a determined and passionate individual who is willing to take risks to pursue her dreams. Despite facing challenges in making ends meet as an artist, she remains optimistic and open to new opportunities. Her humility and gratitude towards Mr. Li's guidance also suggest that she values mentorship and is appreciative of others' support.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm) - a relatively slender build, which may allow her to move easily through the busy streets of Taipei.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - expressive and warm eyes that sparkle with creativity and enthusiasm.
* Hair: Black, long, and wavy - possibly styled in a manner that complements her artistic expression.

**Interests:** Merike is deeply passionate about art, particularly traditional Taiwanese architecture. She spends most of her free time experimenting with different mediums and techniques to capture the vibrant colors and textures of her surroundings. Her love for art leads her to explore new styles and inspiration, often discovering hidden gems in unexpected places, like the antique shop "Curios and Wonders."

Keep in mind that these attributes are based on a single story, and Merike's character might evolve or change as more narratives are added to her world.
