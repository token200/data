Here's a summary of the fictional character Merike Põld:

**Physical Attributes:**
Merike is a slender woman with an unassuming presence. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with a gentle face and soft features that belied her exceptional talent as a weaver. Her eyes are a deep, rich brown that sparkle with creativity, and her hair is a rich, dark blonde that falls in loose waves down her back.

**Personality:**
Merike is an artistic soul with a quiet confidence and introspective nature. She is deeply empathetic and understanding, able to tap into the emotions of those who commission her tapestries and weave them into intricate patterns that capture their stories. Her creativity is fueled by a deep love of Estonian folklore and mythology, which she weaves into every thread of her work.

**Interests:**
Merike's passions include weaving, storytelling, poetry, and the natural world. She finds inspiration in the rhythms of nature – the way light filters through leaves, the songs of birds at dawn, or the intricate patterns found in flower petals. Her love of Estonian folklore is matched only by her love of words and language, which she uses to infuse her tapestries with meaning and symbolism.

**Additional Traits:**
Merike has a remarkable attention to detail and a patient spirit that allows her to coax intricate designs from the threads on her loom. She is also deeply introspective, often finding solace in the quiet hours spent alone in her workshop, surrounded by skeins of yarn and half-finished tapestries.
