Based on the short story provided, here's a summary of Michael Durand's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Michael Durand is a complex and mysterious individual with a tough exterior and deep-seated vulnerabilities. He is driven by a fierce determination to seek revenge against those who have wronged him in the past. His need for justice and retribution is all-consuming, making him a formidable and relentless adversary. However, this single-minded focus on revenge also makes him appear fanatical or even obsessive to others.

Despite his tough exterior, Michael has a dry sense of humor and a cold, calculating gaze that hints at a deeper emotional life. His calm and collected demeanor belies the intensity and fury that burns within him, making him a compelling and formidable character.

**Physical Attributes:**

Michael Durand is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with a lean and athletic build honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in high-stakes heists. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with broad shoulders and a imposing presence.

His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, giving him an unnerving stare that can be disarming or intimidating, depending on the situation. His dark hair is cut short and neat, framing his angular face and sharp jawline.

**Interests:**

Michael Durand's interests are largely centered around his personal vendetta against Marcus Thompson and his efforts to seek revenge. However, beyond this singular focus, it is unclear what else drives or fulfills him.

He appears to be well-versed in the art of stealth and deception, using these skills to outwit his enemies and stay one step ahead of those who would do him harm. He also seems to have a keen strategic mind, always planning several moves ahead of his opponents.

Outside of his work as an assassin or thief, it is unlikely that Michael Durand has any meaningful relationships or interests beyond his quest for revenge against Marcus Thompson. His focus on this singular goal has consumed him completely, leaving little room for other pursuits or connections in his life.
