**Personality:** Michael is a dedicated, meticulous, and passionate individual. He has a strong sense of family legacy and tradition, which motivates him to preserve and restore pieces of history that have been passed down through generations. He is also sentimental, often finding himself lost in memories of his great-grandmother and the happy times they shared together.

**Physical Attributes:** Michael is likely an older adult, possibly in his 50s or 60s, with a gentle, weathered face and a kind smile. His height is around 5'10" (178 cm), and his eye color is blue, hinting at a Scandinavian or Irish heritage. He has silver hair that he wears short, framing his face, and a bushy gray beard that adds to his distinguished appearance.

**Interests:** Michael's primary interest is restoration and woodworking, which reflects his passion for preserving the past and creating something new from old materials. He is particularly skilled in carpentry, woodwork, and antique restoration, and enjoys working with traditional techniques to bring pieces of history back to life. His love for family legacy and tradition also drives his interests in genealogy, history, and cultural preservation.

In addition to these interests, Michael seems to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, such as spending time in nature (as evidenced by his workshop's proximity to sunlight), cooking, and baking (hinted at by the scent of freshly baked cookies wafting from the kitchen). He also values the quiet moments of contemplation that come with restoration work, which allows him to reflect on memories and emotions.
