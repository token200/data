Here is a summary of the fictional character Michael Petrenko:

**Physical Attributes:**
Michael Petrenko stands at 5'11" with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his brooding intensity. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to see right through to the soul. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got in a bar fight during his younger years.

**Personality:**
Michael is a complex and introspective person with a passion for music that borders on obsession. He is fiercely dedicated to his art and will stop at nothing to create something truly authentic. Despite his success, Michael has a deep-seated sense of insecurity and struggles with feelings of inadequacy. He is intensely passionate and emotional, often wearing his heart on his sleeve. This can make him come across as intense or even abrasive to those who don't know him, but those closest to him understand that he is simply deeply feeling.

**Interests:**
Michael's interests are largely centered around music, of course, but he also has a deep love for literature and poetry. He is often found reading the works of Bob Dylan, Walt Whitman, or Sylvia Plath in his downtime, and can frequently be heard quoting lines from their books to himself as he writes new material. In addition to his love of words, Michael is also a bit of a film buff, with a particular fondness for the works of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.

**Other Details:**
Michael's relationship with his parents is close but complicated. His father was a struggling musician who always encouraged Michael's passion for music, but ultimately struggled to connect with him on a deeper level. As a result, Michael has built walls around himself, both emotionally and professionally. Despite this, he remains fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly his bandmates in "Echo Fade".
