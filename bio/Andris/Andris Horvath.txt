Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Andris Horvath:

**Personality:** Andris appears to be introspective, analytical, and driven. As a former journalist, he has a strong work ethic and a passion for uncovering the truth. He also seems to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by his smile when feeling like a "man reborn." However, his past controversies suggest that he may struggle with self-doubt and the weight of expectations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'0" (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Light Brown

It's worth noting that there is no description of Andris's hair color in the original story, so I've taken some creative liberties to provide a plausible answer. His height and eye color are inferred from his presence and appearance on the train platform.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Andris has a strong interest in investigation and research. He seems to enjoy uncovering hidden stories and secrets, and is driven by a desire to tell accurate and compelling tales. In his hometown of Riga, he is fascinated by the city's history and appears to be particularly interested in exploring its lesser-known narratives.
