He spends countless hours poring over dusty scrolls and crumbling manuscripts, seeking out new insights and understanding the intricacies of his craft. Malik is also deeply interested in alchemy, seeing it as a means to unlock hidden potential within himself and those around him. His interests extend beyond pure magical pursuits, however, as he is also drawn to the study of medicine and healing, recognizing that even the most powerful magic can only take you so far if not used for the greater good.

**Quirks and Habits:**
Malik Faust has a habit of carrying a small leather-bound journal with him at all times, jotting down notes and observations as he goes about his work.
