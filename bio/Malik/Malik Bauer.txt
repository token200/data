**Personality:** Malik is a complex and driven individual with a strong sense of determination and curiosity. As a former CIA operative turned freelance security consultant, he has honed his skills in high-stakes missions and adaptability, but this latest assignment has reignited a personal quest that challenges him on an emotional level. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often operating outside the boundaries of traditional authority structures.

**Physical Attributes:** Malik stands at 6'1" with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark brown hair is typically styled in a messy, piecey fashion, giving him an air of ruggedness. He has a lean and athletic build, honed from years of physical training and high-intensity activities.

**Interests:** Malik's interests are centered around his family history and the search for answers about his estranged father. His professional background as a security consultant and CIA operative also informs his passion for international relations, geopolitics, and tactical strategy. Outside of work, he appears to enjoy long-distance running and solo travel, allowing him to clear his mind and focus on his personal goals.
