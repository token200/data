He is fiercely independent and values his autonomy, which drives him to take on high-risk cases that others might shy away from. Outside of work, he has few hobbies, but those that do exist are often related to his military past or his desire for self-improvement. These may include reading historical texts, practicing martial arts, or meditating to clear his mind.

In terms of interests, Malik King is not much of a social butterfly, preferring the company of quiet, introspective moments.
