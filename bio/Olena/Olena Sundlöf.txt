Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Olena Sundl√∂f's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olena appears to be a creative and open-minded individual with a passion for art. She seems to be a free spirit who values exploration and discovery, as evidenced by her extensive travels through Europe before arriving in Stockholm. Her ability to connect with Anna, the gallery owner, suggests that she is also empathetic and able to form meaningful relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are mentioned in the short story beyond Olena's eye color, which is described as "eyes scanning [the small station]". However, I will assume some additional details based on the context. Assuming Olena is of Eastern European or Nordic descent (given her Finnish background), I would imagine her to have:

* Height: around 5'8" (173 cm) - a tall and slender build that allows her to move freely in crowded spaces.
* Eye Color: Blue-green eyes, possibly with flecks of gold or hazel, reflecting her Scandinavian heritage.

**Interests:** As an artist, Olena's primary interest is creating art. She has a passion for abstract expressionism and seems to be drawn to artists who share similar values. Her excitement about exploring new places and experiencing different cultures suggests that she also has a strong sense of wanderlust and a love for travel.

Additionally, based on the story, it can be inferred that Olena is:

* Curious: Her exploration of Stockholm's streets and galleries demonstrates her curiosity about the world around her.
* Open-minded: Olena is willing to engage in conversations with strangers (Anna) and consider new ideas and perspectives.
* Resilient: After months of traveling through Europe, she feels a mix of excitement and trepidation upon arriving in Stockholm, but ultimately finds solace and inspiration in her new surroundings.
