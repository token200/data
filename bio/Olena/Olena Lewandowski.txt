Based on the short story, here is a summary of Olena Lewandowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Olena appears to be a determined and driven individual, given her experience as a journalist and her ability to handle tight deadlines. She also seems to have a strong sense of instinct, trusting Ivan's instincts even when they lead her down "dark alleys." Olena's personality is likely characterized by her independence, resilience, and ability to adapt to new situations.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown
- Hair Color: Brown or dark auburn

Given the lack of information about her physical appearance in the story, I've made some educated guesses. The description of Ivan's warm smile and Olena's handshake implies that she has a friendly and approachable demeanor.

Interests:
As a journalist, it can be assumed that Olena is interested in storytelling, investigation, and uncovering the truth. Her ability to follow a lead on a potentially career-making story suggests that she is driven by curiosity and a desire for investigative journalism. Olena's interest in this specific assignment may also hint at her passion for social justice or rebellion, as hinted at by Ivan's description of the night air being "thick with smoke and rebellion."

It's worth noting that these are just interpretations based on a short story and can be subject to change depending on further development of Olena's character.
