* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a long braid or tied back in a ponytail

**Personality:**

Olena Mägi is a introspective and curious individual, driven by a passion for understanding the intricacies of Estonian folklore. She is fiercely dedicated to her work, often becoming completely absorbed in her research, forgetting about the world around her. Despite this intensity, Olena has a kind and empathetic nature, allowing her to form deep connections with the people she meets. Her love for mythology and folklore gives her a sense of wonder and awe, which she expresses through her eyes and smile.

**Interests:**

Olena's interests are centered around Estonian mythology and folklore, as well as anthropology and cultural studies. She is particularly fascinated by the female figures in Estonian mythology, such as goddesses, witches, and forest spirits.

In addition to her research, Olena enjoys spending time in nature, whether it's walking through forests or simply sitting by a river, listening to the sounds of the wilderness.

It is worth noting that Olena Mägi seems to be quite introspective and private person who is not very outgoing or social but deeply passionate about folklore.
