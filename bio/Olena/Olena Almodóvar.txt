**Personality:** Olena is a introspective and curious individual. She has a strong sense of connection to her roots and is willing to take risks to reconnect with her heritage. She's also determined and resilient, having navigated the complexities of adulthood and leaving her childhood behind in Ukraine. Despite her tough exterior, she's emotionally vulnerable and open to forming deep connections with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Olena stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is dark brown and straight, often worn in a simple style that frames her face. Her eyes are an striking shade of green, reminiscent of the color depicted in the old photograph she finds. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, which add to her introspective and artistic demeanor.

**Interests:** Olena is passionate about art, history, and storytelling. She's always been fascinated by the human experience and the ways in which people cope with adversity. Her experiences as an immigrant have given her a unique perspective on identity, culture, and belonging. In Barcelona, she becomes fascinated by the city's rich history, particularly during the Spanish Civil War, and spends hours exploring museums, attending lectures, and talking to locals about their stories.

Olena is also drawn to the world of photography, which becomes an outlet for her emotions and a way to capture the beauty of the world around her. Her camera becomes an extension of herself as she travels through Spain, documenting the landscapes, people, and places that inspire her.
