He is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to uncover hidden patterns and codes within the stars. Despite his intellectual pursuits, he has a creative side, often finding himself lost in thought as he gazes up at the night sky. Ethan's past is shrouded in mystery, and those who know him whisper tales of a troubled history that has left him with a rare condition known as synesthesia â€“ the ability to see colors when hearing sounds.
