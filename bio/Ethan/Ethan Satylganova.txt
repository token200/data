Here is a summary of Ethan Satylganova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ethan stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to absorb light around them. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his pale skin. He has a strong jawline and piercing eyebrows that give him a sharp, introspective look.

**Personality:**
Ethan appears to be introverted and slightly eccentric, with a dry sense of humor that he uses to deflect attention from himself. Despite this, there is an air of vulnerability about him, suggesting that he may be more emotionally complex than he initially lets on. He seems driven by a curiosity about the world and its secrets, which leads him to pursue obscure interests and passions.

**Interests:**
Ethan is drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, often seeking out rare and unusual artifacts in antique shops like Mrs. Jenkins'. His fascination with Sylph's Lament suggests that he has an affinity for music, particularly melancholic or haunting melodies. He seems to be particularly interested in exploring the emotional resonance of these types of compositions, as if trying to tap into a deeper understanding of human experience.

It's also worth noting that Ethan appears to have some self-awareness about his own connection to Sylph's Lament, recognizing the warning from Mrs. Jenkins but feeling powerless to resist its allure. This suggests that he may be struggling with personal demons or insecurities, and that his interests in antiquarian artifacts are a way of seeking control over an unpredictable world.
