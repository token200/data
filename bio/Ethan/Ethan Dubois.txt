Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Ethan Dubois' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ethan appears to be a thoughtful and introspective individual, as evident from his low and thoughtful voice when describing what brings him to the antique shop. He seems comfortable in his own skin and feels at home among the dusty old trinkets, indicating that he values nostalgia and perhaps has a sentimental side. Ethan also appears empathetic, as shown by his emotional response to the music box's melody.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a slightly messy, textured style
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and an expressive pair of eyes

It's not explicitly stated in the story what Ethan's other physical attributes are, so I've chosen to fill in some details while still maintaining consistency with the original narrative.

**Interests:** Ethan seems to have a strong affinity for nostalgia, particularly when it comes to memories from his childhood. He's searching for something that will remind him of his younger self, and the music box, crafted by Mr. Jenkins' grandfather, appears to be a perfect fit. This suggests that Ethan values sentimental objects and perhaps enjoys collecting or curating items that hold emotional significance.

Additionally, Ethan's appreciation for intricate carvings on old wooden cabinets suggests an interest in craftsmanship and possibly woodworking or carpentry.
