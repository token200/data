Here is a summary of Ethan Sandstr√∂m's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:**
Ethan appears to be a introspective and nostalgic person. He has a strong sense of belonging to his hometown, Ravenswood, and feels at peace when surrounded by its familiar sights and sounds. However, he also seems to have been away from home for a long time, which has taken a toll on him. The story suggests that he values connection with others and is eager to reconnect with friends and family.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm) - This height gives Ethan a slightly above-average presence without being overly imposing.
- **Eye Color:** Blue-Grey - The author describes the ocean as having "blue-grey hues," which seems to be an inspiration for Ethan's eye color. The combination of blue and grey creates a sense of calmness, reflecting Ethan's personality.

**Interests:**
Ethan is clearly passionate about art, which he pursued in the city after leaving Ravenswood. His artwork has been successful, but it seems that his time away from home has made him reevaluate what truly brings him joy. He reconnects with his artistic side during his return to Ravenswood, and the natural beauty of the town inspires a sense of peace within him.

The story does not explicitly mention other interests or hobbies for Ethan, but based on his love for art and his connection with nature (as evident in his appreciation of the ocean's scent and colors), it is reasonable to assume that he also enjoys outdoor activities like painting en plein air or simply observing the natural world.
