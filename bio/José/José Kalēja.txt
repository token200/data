**Physical Attributes:** José Kalēja stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of traveling and performing. His hair is dark brown, worn long and unruly, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his rugged charm. His eyes are a deep, soulful brown that seem to hold the weight of countless stories. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a lifetime of adventures, and his voice - rich, baritone, and full of emotion - is a hallmark of his performances.

**Personality:** José Kalēja is a free spirit, driven by a passion for storytelling and connecting with others through the power of words. He is a natural performer, able to weave tales that transport listeners to far-off lands and evoke strong emotions in those who listen. Despite his charisma on stage, he remains humble and kind off stage, always willing to lend an ear or offer a sympathetic word when needed. José has a deep empathy for others, which informs the stories he tells and makes him a beloved figure among those who know him.

**Interests:** Above all else, José Kalēja is passionate about storytelling. He spends hours gathering tales from travelers, villagers, and ancient texts, seeking out new material to weave into his performances. His love of mythology, folklore, and history drives him to explore the world beyond his own lands, seeking inspiration for his stories. Off stage, he enjoys playing the lute, strumming melodies that complement his words and add an extra layer of depth to his performances.

When not performing or gathering new tales, José can be found sipping ale at local taverns, listening to travelers' stories, or simply sitting by a campfire, watching the stars twinkle overhead.
