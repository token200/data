Here's a summary of José Pētersone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** José stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy manner, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold secrets of their own. He sports a well-groomed beard and mustache, which complements the fedora hat he wears on most occasions.

**Personality:** José is an enigmatic individual with a mysterious past, which has left him with a dry sense of humor and an air of caution around those he trusts. Despite this, he possesses a charming, velvety voice that can put even the most skeptical of people at ease. He's introverted and prefers the company of books and whiskey to social gatherings, often coming across as reserved or aloof. However, once you earn his trust, José reveals a deep love for literature, music, and life itself.

**Interests:** José is an avid reader, particularly fond of Russian literature (Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are among his favorite authors). He also has a passion for music, often performing on his guitar in local bars and clubs. When not singing or reading, José enjoys whiskey and the quiet company of strangers who share similar interests.

Additional details:

* José's height allows him to stand out in Riga's compact streets, giving him an air of confidence that belies his introverted nature.
* His eyes hold a deep sadness, hinting at the secrets he keeps hidden behind his charming facade.
* Despite his love for literature, José is not a scholar or academic; rather, he's an intuitive reader who finds meaning in the stories and themes he reads.

These details, while not explicitly stated in the original story, are inferred from the narrative and help to flesh out José Pētersone's character as a multifaceted individual with a rich inner life.
