* Age: Late 50s/Early 60s, with a hint of agelessness due to his reclusive lifestyle

**Interests:** Björkqvist's primary interest is knowledge. He is a voracious reader and researcher, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from ancient history to cryptography. His work for SÄPO as a linguist and cryptographer has given him an affinity for codes, symbols, and ciphers, which he continues to study in his free time.
