Here's a summary of José Majewski's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - This height seems fitting for a former soldier who has likely had to adapt to different environments and circumstances.

**Personality:**

* Brooding and introspective, with a tendency to retreat into himself when faced with emotional challenges (as evidenced by his struggles after arriving in Japan).
* Guarded and private, preferring to keep people at arm's length - This could be due to past traumas or experiences that have left him wary of forming close connections.
* Loyal and compassionate, as seen in his connection with Miko, who touches a nerve in his own troubled soul.
* Haunted by the memories of his past battles, but seeking solace and peace.

**Interests:**

* Solitude and quiet contemplation - José finds comfort in the stillness of the tea house, indicating that he values time alone to reflect on his thoughts and emotions.
