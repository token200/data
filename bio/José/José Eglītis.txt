Based on the short story, I've created a fictional profile for José Eglītis:

**Physical Attributes:** José stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often tousled and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to hold a world of emotions within them. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, from a childhood accident involving a broken glass.

**Personality:** José is a passionate and introspective person, deeply rooted in his art and struggling to find stability in the chaotic city life. Despite the hardships he's faced, he remains optimistic, with an unyielding enthusiasm for music that drives him forward. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking risks to pursue his artistic vision.

**Interests:** José is deeply devoted to his violin playing and composing music. His favorite genres are classical and folk, drawing inspiration from the works of renowned composers like Vivaldi and Bach. Outside of music, he enjoys exploring urban landscapes, discovering hidden gems in the city's alleys, parks, and street art scenes.

**Additional Details:** José was born into a family of musicians and artists, where creativity and self-expression were encouraged from a young age. His parents were hippies who traveled the world, exposing him to diverse cultures and musical traditions. As a result, José has a rich cultural heritage, with a deep appreciation for music as a universal language that transcends borders and boundaries.

I hope this profile fits your short story!
