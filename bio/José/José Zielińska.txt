Based on the inspiration provided, I will create an original character profile for José Zielińska.

**Name:** José Zielińska (José, a Spanish name, combined with the Polish surname Zielińska)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of golden brown
* Hair Color: Rich, dark brown with subtle waves
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a warm glow

**Personality:** José is a free-spirited and adventurous individual with a strong sense of curiosity. She has a contagious enthusiasm for life and is always eager to explore new experiences. As a Polish-Spanish heritage character, she has a deep appreciation for both cultures and is not afraid to celebrate her mixed roots.

José is also fiercely independent, determined to make her own way in the world without relying on others. However, this trait can sometimes lead her to be self-reliant to a fault, making it challenging for her to ask for help or accept assistance when needed.

**Interests:** José has an insatiable passion for art, music, and literature. She is particularly drawn to traditional Spanish flamenco dance and plays the guitar in her free time. When not exploring local cultures or learning new languages, she can be found indulging in Polish folk cuisine and practicing her culinary skills.

In terms of creative pursuits, José has a strong desire to tell stories that bridge cultural divides, using her experiences as a hybrid individual to create authentic narratives. She dreams of writing novels, making films, or even starting her own art collective.
