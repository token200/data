Based on the short story, here is a summary of Aleksandra Wozniak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksandra Wozniak is a young and ambitious journalist with a keen sense of curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. She has a strong determination and drive to uncover the truth, even in the face of danger. Her fascination with the supernatural suggests that she may have a somewhat morbid or dark side, but her desire for answers keeps her focused on her goals.

**Physical Attributes:** Aleksandra is likely in her mid-to-late twenties, given her young and ambitious nature. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with long legs that seem to be proportioned to her slender frame. Her eyes are an piercing green, a trait that seems out of place among the darker hues often associated with her line of work.

**Interests:** Aleksandra's interests lie squarely in the realm of journalism and investigation. She is particularly drawn to the supernatural and unexplained phenomena, spending countless hours pouring over ancient texts and seeking out experts in the field. Her research has taken her down dark paths, but she remains driven by a desire to uncover the truth behind these mysterious events.

It's worth noting that Aleksandra's physical attributes are somewhat missing from the original story, so I had to make some assumptions about her build and stature based on her age and occupation.
