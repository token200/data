Here is a summary of Aleksandra "Sasha" Navratilova's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the fictional story:

**Personality:** Sasha is a quiet, reserved individual who values peace and tranquility. She is depicted as someone with a deep respect for her sister Martina's accomplishments and dedication to tennis, which suggests that she is admiring and supportive of others' passions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark Brown

These physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the story, but they can be inferred based on the fact that Martina Navratilova is often described as tall and slender. Given Sasha's twin sister relationship with Martina, it's likely that Sasha shares similar physical characteristics.

**Interests:** Sasha's interests seem to revolve around books, literature, and tennis (in a supporting capacity). She works as a librarian and enjoys chatting with book lovers who share her passion for literature. Her love for tennis is more of an appreciation-based interest, as she admires her sister's achievements and legacy.

It's worth noting that Sasha's personality, physical attributes, and interests are somewhat less developed than those of her twin sister Martina Navratilova, which may be intentional given the story's focus on their sibling relationship rather than individual personalities.
