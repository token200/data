* Build: Lean, athletic build from years of working as a sound engineer
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and a small nose that gives him a gentle, introspective appearance

**Interests:** Martín is passionate about music, particularly tango, which he believes holds a special place in the hearts of Buenos Aires' inhabitants. He is also deeply interested in sound engineering and recording, as well as mentoring young artists to help them discover their own unique voice.

Additional details that can be added to Martín's character:
