**Physical Attributes:**
Martín stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an unassuming presence. His eye color is a deep, piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets. He has unruly brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy sweep. Martín's features are slender and angular, giving him a faintly bookish appearance.

**Personality:**
Martín is an enigmatic figure with a quiet confidence that commands respect. Despite his reserved demeanor, he possesses an unwavering intensity when engaged on a task he loves – be it playing the piano or deciphering codes. He is fiercely independent and intensely focused, which can make him appear aloof to those who don't know him.

**Interests:**
Martín has a deep passion for puzzles, codes, and cryptography. His fingers are trained to navigate complex patterns and decipher hidden meanings, skills he developed early on as a pianist. Music remains an essential part of his life, with the piano serving as a source of comfort and inspiration. In addition to cryptography, Martín is also intrigued by literature and history, often finding connections between seemingly disparate texts and events.

In terms of other interests, Martín seems to be a voracious reader and researcher, devouring books on topics ranging from mathematics to philosophy. He has a keen analytical mind and enjoys solving problems that others deem unsolvable.

It's worth noting that Martín's interests extend beyond intellectual pursuits – his love for music and puzzles is deeply personal, speaking to a desire for beauty and meaning in an often chaotic world.
