Since there is no public figure by the name of Martín DiCaprio, I'll create a fictional character inspired by the short story.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm hazel with golden flecks
* Hair: Dark brown, messy, and often unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face
* Build: Lean and athletic, built from years of exploring the outdoors

**Personality:**

* Free-spirited and adventurous, always chasing his passion for marine biology
* Compassionate and empathetic, with a strong sense of social justice
* Determined and driven, willing to take risks to make a difference
* Humble and unassuming, preferring to let his work speak for itself

**Interests:**

* Marine biology and ocean conservation
* Surfing and paddleboarding
* Reading about history, philosophy, and the intersection of science and society
* Playing guitar and writing songs inspired by his experiences
* Exploring new places and trying different cuisines

As a fictional character, Martín DiCaprio embodies the same values and passions as Leonardo DiCaprio, with a few unique twists to make him his own.
