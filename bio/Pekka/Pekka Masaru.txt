Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Pekka Masaru's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pekka Masaru is a complex and sensitive soul with an air of quiet confidence. He is a recluse by nature but has a profound impact on those who know him due to his calm demeanor and empathetic listening skills. He is wise, compassionate, and understanding, making him an invaluable friend and confidant.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Pekka Masaru's physical appearance, except for his rugged exterior, which suggests that he may have a strong build or facial features that contribute to his rough-around-the-edges demeanor. It is also implied that he may be of average to above-average height, as there are no specific measurements mentioned.

However, we can make an educated guess about his eye color based on the story's description of him gazing at Sofia with "a look of quiet understanding." Given that the protagonist and other characters have Scandinavian features (he's from Finland), it's possible that Pekka Masaru has piercing blue or green eyes, which would complement his rugged exterior.

**Interests:** Pekka Masaru is deeply passionate about nature, particularly botany and entomology. He has spent his life studying the unique species found in Finland's forests and has become a skilled expert in these fields. His love for nature is evident throughout the story, from his childhood fascination with collecting leaves and stones to his adult pursuits as a botanist and entomologist.

Additionally, he appears to be interested in meditation and contemplation, often sitting by a stream and listening to its gentle melody. This suggests that he values quiet reflection and finds solace in nature's symphonies.
