Here's a summary of Pekka Ming's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pekka is a quiet, introspective individual who has grown accustomed to the comforts of routine. As a retired librarian, he values knowledge and order above all else, often finding solace in the structured world of the Dewey Decimal System. However, his encounter with Elara shakes him out of his complacency, revealing a sense of curiosity and wonder that had been dormant within him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Pekka stands at 5'8" (173 cm), slender and unassuming.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown, often lost behind a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose.
* Hair: His hair is graying and thinning, combed neatly over his scalp in an attempt to conceal his balding spots.
* Face: Pekka's face is pale and slightly lined, etched by years of staring at dusty tomes rather than the sun.

**Interests:** As a retired librarian, Pekka has always been passionate about knowledge and literature. His interests lie in cataloging and organizing books, especially those on ancient history, mythology, and philosophy. He spends most of his days sorting through shelves of texts, searching for forgotten knowledge and obscure references.

In addition to his love of learning, Pekka also enjoys the quiet comfort of solitude, often finding solace in the musty scent of old books and the soft hum of fluorescent lighting in the library's fluorescent-lit corridors. His life was centered around routine and familiarity, but Elara's arrival brings a new sense of excitement and adventure to his world.

It is clear that Pekka has an undercurrent of restlessness beneath his reserved exterior, and his time spent with Elara will push him to explore new horizons and rekindle the spark within.
