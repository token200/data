Here is a summary of Pekka Williams' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pekka is a determined and driven individual who has seen the best and worst of humanity through his years as a detective. He is consumed by puzzles and patterns, always seeking to uncover the truth behind crimes. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for justice and will go to great lengths to prove himself. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and questioning norms. Pekka's experience with darkness and despair has left emotional scars, but they have also fueled his passion for uncovering the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm), towering over most people in the room
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, a color that seems almost piercing or intense due to their depth
* Hair: Dark brown, worn messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, from years of physical labor and physical activity
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a nose slightly too big for his face

**Interests:** Pekka is deeply interested in:

* Criminology and forensic science
* Uncovering patterns and puzzles
* Analyzing evidence and piecing together seemingly unrelated pieces of information
* Justice and morality (he believes that justice should always prevail)
* Sipping coffee, a habit he's developed over the years to fuel his mental processing

His interests are largely centered around work and solving crimes. While he may enjoy some aspects of his job, such as being an intellectual challenge or working with someone he trusts (like Sanna), it's clear that his true passion is for justice itself.

The only interest outside of work mentioned in the original text is a general enjoyment of socializing at the local pub with friends.
