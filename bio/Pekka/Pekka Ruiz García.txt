His dark hair is often worn long and unruly, framing a face that is both strong-jawed and heart-shaped.

**Personality:** Pekka Ruiz García is a man of quiet confidence, carrying himself with an air of mystery that is both captivating and intimidating. He exudes a sense of calm and centeredness, as if he has always known exactly where he is going in life. Despite his success and fame, Pekka remains humble and true to his roots, never losing sight of the vibrant streets of Barcelona that nurtured his art.

Above all, however, Pekka is drawn to the city of Barcelona itself, where he feels most at home and connected to his artistic heritage.
