Here is a summary of Pekka Zielinski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pekka is a man of few words, but when he speaks, his voice carries weight. He is driven by a desire for justice, no matter how flawed or imperfect he might be. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to help those who are suffering. His gut tells him that there's often more to a situation than meets the eye, and he trusts his instincts.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a wiry physique honed from years of working out in his cramped office

**Interests:** Pekka's interests seem to revolve around solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. As a former journalist turned private investigator, he has a keen eye for detail and a knack for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. He is also an avid reader and researcher, always looking for new leads and insights that might aid him in his investigations.

Outside of work, Pekka's interests seem to be centered around whiskey and cigarettes (although he's mentioned that his office smells more of stale perfume than cigarette smoke). He appears to enjoy the solitary nature of his work, often spending hours alone in his cramped office, lost in thought.

It's worth noting that Pekka seems to have a somewhat melancholic outlook on life, but one that is tempered by a strong sense of justice and determination. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep empathy for those who are struggling and a willingness to go the extra mile to help them.
