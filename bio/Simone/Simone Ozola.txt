Here's a summary of Simone Ozola's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Simone Ozola stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a wild tangle of curly brown locks that often escapes her loose braids or ponytails. Her eyes are a striking feature - a deep shade of blue reminiscent of the Baltic Sea, with golden flecks that sparkle like starlight in low light conditions. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:** Simone Ozola is an enigmatic and introspective person with a rich inner life. She has a deeply empathetic nature, able to connect with people on a profound level through her music. Her performances are raw, emotive, and deeply personal, making her audience feel like they're experiencing something intimate and sacred. Offstage, Simone is introverted and private, preferring to observe the world around her rather than being the center of attention.

**Interests:** Music is Simone Ozola's lifeblood - she lives and breathes it. As a child, she spent hours listening to classical music with her family, learning to play the piano and flute by ear. Her repertoire spans traditional Latvian folk songs to contemporary ballads and original compositions that reflect her own emotions and experiences. In addition to music, Simone has a deep love for nature - spending countless hours exploring Riga's Old Town parks and forests, and feeling most at peace when surrounded by the sounds of birdsong and rustling leaves.

As she begins to explore the wider world beyond Riga, Simone is drawn to the idea of experimentation and creative expression. She longs to collaborate with other musicians, try out new instruments, and push herself outside her comfort zone as an artist. The message on that mysterious sheet of paper has awakened a sense of purpose within her - "Follow your melody" becomes a clarion call to pursue her passions and see where the music takes her next.
