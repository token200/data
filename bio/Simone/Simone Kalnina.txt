Here's a summary of Simone Kalnina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Simone is 5'8" (173 cm) with long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a rich waterfall. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with warmth and kindness, often sparkling with a hint of mischief when she's baking up a storm in the kitchen. She has a radiant complexion, thanks to years of working outdoors in her bakery.

**Personality:** Simone is a warm and charismatic individual with a quick wit and infectious laugh that puts those around her at ease. She's confident, yet introverted, often hiding behind her bright smile and playful banter to mask any vulnerabilities. As the story reveals, she's more complex than meets the eye, struggling with the weight of expectation and navigating solo living after a recent breakup.

**Interests:** Simone is deeply passionate about baking, with a love for traditional pastries and innovative flavor combinations. She spends most of her days perfecting her craft in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and techniques to delight her customers at "Sweet Delights." In her free time, she enjoys exploring the town's hidden gems, attending local art events, and reading books on photography (her love for which was sparked by Alex).
