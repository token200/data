Here is a summary of the fictional character Simone Schmidt:

**Physical Attributes:**
Simone is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. She has an unassuming appearance, often lost in thought as she works on her art. While there are no explicit details about her physical attributes, it can be inferred that she has a slender build and is possibly around 5'8" to 6'0" (173-183 cm) tall, with a subtle yet striking presence. Her eye color is not explicitly stated in the original text, but based on the description of Alice's piercing green eyes, it can be suggested that Simone might have bright blue or gray eyes.

**Personality:**
Simone is an enigmatic and introverted individual who prefers to keep her personal life private. She is deeply passionate about her art, often becoming lost in her creative world, as if the outside world doesn't exist. Her quick wit and smile suggest that she has a dry sense of humor and can be quite charming when she wants to be. Despite her reclusive nature, Simone seems to have a deep empathy for others and is drawn to those who share her interests and passions.

**Interests:**
Simone is an artist with a strong interest in symbolism, mythology, and mysticism. She spends hours studying ancient myths and forgotten histories, weaving these stories into her art in a way that's both beautiful and unsettling. Her studio is filled with colorful fabrics, half-finished canvases, and odd trinkets collected from her travels, reflecting her eclectic and globally-inspired artistic style. When not working on her art, Simone might be interested in spiritual practices, philosophy, or language, as hinted at by the mysterious energy emanating from Alice's box.

**Additional Details:**
Simone seems to have a unique connection to the world of mysticism and symbolism, which allows her to tap into hidden frequencies and codes that run through her art. Her ability to sense this energy suggests that she might possess some sort of spiritual or intuitive sensitivity, allowing her to perceive the world in ways others may not. This could be an area of interest for Simone's character development, exploring her deeper connection to the mysteries of the universe.
