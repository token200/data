Here is a summary of the fictional character Simone Lehtonen:

**Physical Attributes:** Simone stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. Her piercing eyes are a striking shade of icy blue, often described as "frigid" by those who know her. Her hair is dark brown and often pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a determined jawline and prominent cheekbones.

**Personality:** Simone is an unyielding and fearless individual with an unwavering passion for climbing and mountaineering. She has earned the nickname "The Ice Queen" due to her calm and composed demeanor in the face of extreme adversity. Despite this, she exudes a fierce intensity that commands respect from those around her. Simone is also deeply driven and focused, often to the point of obsession, as seen in her preparation for Mount Kanchenjunga.

**Interests:** As mentioned, climbing and mountaineering are Simone's primary passions. She has spent her entire life honing her skills and pushing herself to new heights (literally). Outside of climbing, Simone is not particularly known to have other interests or hobbies that are mentioned in the short story. However, it can be inferred that she values independence, self-reliance, and the thrill of exploration.

It's worth noting that while some details about Simone's physical attributes were not explicitly stated, I made educated guesses based on the context provided by her nickname "The Ice Queen" and her behavior in the short story.
