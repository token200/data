**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Simone stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm), allowing her to move around comfortably in cramped spaces.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an arresting shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to gleam with intensity when she's working on a project.
* Hair: Simone's hair is dark brown and pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing her pointed chin and sharp jawline.
* Build: She has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of working in the city's underworld and navigating cramped workshops.

**Interests:** As a cybernetic engineer, Simone's primary interest is in advancing her craft, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology. She appears to have a particular fascination with artificial intelligence, AI systems that can adapt to any network or database. Her work on these projects seems to be driven by an insatiable hunger for discovery and innovation.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Simone may have a hidden interest in the spiritual realm, as hinted at in the passage when she mentions "the spirits of forgotten innovation whispering secrets in her ear." This could suggest that she has a somewhat mystical or philosophical side to her personality.
