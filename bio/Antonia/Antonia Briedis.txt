Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Antonia Briedis:

**Personality:** Antonia appears to be a free-spirited and adventurous individual, with a sense of wanderlust and restlessness. She has a strong connection to her family's past and heritage, but also feels an insatiable desire to explore beyond the horizon. She is likely a determined and resourceful person, as evidenced by her willingness to take on new challenges and help out at the bakery. Her relationship with her aunt suggests that she values warmth, comfort, and close relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the text does not provide specific details about Antonia's physical attributes, but we can make some educated guesses based on her age and appearance in the story. Given that she is an adult returning to her hometown after spending summers there as a child, it's possible that she is in her mid-to-late twenties or early thirties. As for eye color, the text only mentions her eyes scanning the station, so we can't determine her exact eye color.

However, based on her character and personality, I would imagine Antonia to have:

* Warm, earthy tones to her appearance, possibly with a golden glow from spending time outdoors
* A slender yet athletic build, suggesting she values physical activity and exploration
* Long hair that might be tied back when working in the bakery or kept loose for everyday wear

**Interests:** It's clear that Antonia has a strong connection to her family's past, particularly their maritime heritage. She is drawn to stories of adventure on the high seas and feels a sense of restlessness that suggests she craves excitement and discovery.

Some possible interests of hers include:

* Exploration and travel, both physically and metaphorically
* History and genealogy, with a particular interest in her family's past and experiences at sea
* Cooking and baking, particularly traditional or regional specialties like those found in the old family bakery
* Storytelling and listening to tales from others, as evidenced by her grandfather's stories and her aunt's own narrative style
