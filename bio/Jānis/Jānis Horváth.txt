Based on the story provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Jānis Horváth:

**Personality:**
Jānis Horváth is an inventive and meticulous individual with a passion for his craft. He is driven by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of clockmaking. Despite being surrounded by the hustle and bustle of industrialization, he remains dedicated to traditional techniques and values the beauty in each piece of machinery. Jānis is also a perfectionist, willing to spend countless hours refining his designs and experimenting with new ideas.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Dark brown, almost black
- **Hair:** Short, dark brown, often worn neatly combed to one side
- **Facial Features:** Strong jawline, prominent nose, and expressive eyes that light up when discussing his craft

**Interests:**
Jānis's primary interests lie in clockmaking and mechanical engineering. He is fascinated by the intricacies of timepieces and spends a significant amount of time studying celestial movements, experimenting with new mechanisms, and collaborating with other experts in the field.

In his free time, Jānis enjoys tinkering with wooden tools, observing the way light interacts with various materials, and taking long walks along the Latvian coast to clear his mind. He is also a collector of rare books on astronomy and mathematics, often spending hours poring over their pages, seeking inspiration for new projects.

While not explicitly stated in the original story, Jānis's love for nature seems to be reflected in his work, as he carefully incorporates elements that connect with the celestial world into his timepieces. This connection allows him to create pieces that transcend mere functionality and evoke a sense of wonder in those who see them.
