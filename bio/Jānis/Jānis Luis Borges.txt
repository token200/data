Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' life, I'll create a fictional character profile for Jānis Luis Borges:

Physical Attributes:
- Age: Late 30s
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue-green, reminiscent of the Mediterranean Sea
- Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and tousled, as if perpetually swept by a stormy breeze

Personality:
Jānis Luis Borges is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and wit. His sharp intellect and quick mind make him a formidable conversationalist, capable of navigating the most complex philosophical debates with ease. He exudes an air of quiet confidence, as if he holds secrets that only reveal themselves to those who dare approach him.

Interests:
Jānis Luis's fascination with time and space is rivaled only by his love for literature and poetry. He devours classic works of philosophy, from Plato to Kant, and often weaves their ideas into his own stories and poems. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the hidden corners of Buenos Aires, where ancient tales and forgotten lore await discovery.

Habits:
Jānis Luis has a habit of jotting down fragments of ideas in an old leather-bound notebook, which he keeps with him at all times. He's often lost in thought, wandering the streets or sitting in quiet cafes, as if the city itself is his muse.

Inspirations:
His favorite authors are the Romantics, particularly Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, whose emphasis on the beauty of language and the power of imagination resonates deeply with Jānis Luis. He's also drawn to the works of Sigmund Freud, whose theories on the human psyche continue to intrigue him.

Quirks:
Jānis Luis has a tendency to become completely absorbed in his own world-building, often losing track of time or neglecting his physical surroundings. When he's fully immersed in his creations, his eyes take on an otherworldly glint, as if he's gazing into the very fabric of reality.

This fictional character profile is inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' life and literary style, with some creative liberties taken to suit Jānis Luis Borges' distinct personality.
