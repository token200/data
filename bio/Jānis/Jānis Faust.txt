Jānis is ambitious and driven, with a burning desire to surpass his current limitations. He is intelligent and curious, often feeling stifled by the conventional nature of his apprenticeship. As he becomes more entangled in the mysterious forces within the book, he begins to struggle with his own identity and morality, becoming increasingly enthralled by the dark power that courses through him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Jānis stands at about 5'10" (178 cm), with a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of physical labor in the workshop.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, a trait that seems to be enhanced by his connection to the mysterious forces within the book.

**Interests:**

* Woodworking and Carpentry: Jānis's skill as a craftsman is evident in his attention to detail and mastery of various woodworking techniques. However, he feels restricted by the practical nature of his profession.
