He was born and raised in a family of modest means but encouraged his creativity from a young age by his mother, an art teacher. Jānis studied fine arts at the University of Latvia and now works as a freelance painter, specializing in landscapes and cityscapes.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue with golden flecks

**Personality:** Jānis is a free-spirited individual with a passion for life's experiences. He's outgoing, charismatic, and always up for an adventure. As an artist, he's fiercely creative and often finds himself lost in his own world of colors and emotions. Despite this, he's also down-to-earth and empathetic, making him a beloved friend and confidant among those who know him.

**Interests:** Jānis is fascinated by the intersection of nature and urban life. He spends most of his free time exploring Riga's hidden alleys, capturing them on canvas, or practicing photography to capture the beauty of the city and its people. Music is another one of his passions; he plays the guitar and enjoys playing folk music inspired by Latvian traditions.
