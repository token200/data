Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Élise Tamm's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Élise Tamm appears to be an enigmatic and introverted person. She is driven by her passion for botany and is fiercely dedicated to her work. However, she also has a compassionate side, as evident in her willingness to help her estranged sister Camille. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Élise is not just a botanist, but also a guardian of ancient secrets. She possesses a sense of responsibility and determination, which drives her to uncover the truth alongside her sister.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details about Élise's physical appearance are mentioned in the story. However, based on the context, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Élise is likely an average or slightly above-average height, given that she spends most of her days working among plants and can focus on intricate details without being easily distracted.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified in the story, but considering her introverted nature and attention to detail, I would imagine her eyes to be a deep, rich brown or green.

**Interests:** Élise's primary interest is botany, particularly rare species. She is an expert in her field and spends most of her time tending to the gardens of the botanical institute where she works. Her research on ancient civilizations suggests that she also has a strong interest in history and archaeology.

Additionally, it appears that Élise enjoys spending time with her sister Camille, as their shared discussions over coffee reveal a deep understanding of each other's quirks and passions. This suggests that Élise values relationships and connections, which may not be immediately apparent from her introverted personality.

As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Élise has a deeper purpose beyond botany – she is driven to uncover ancient secrets and protect them for future generations.
