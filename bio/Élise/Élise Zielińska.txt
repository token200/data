Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Élise Zielińska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Élise appears to be determined and driven, as evident from her weeks-long search for her mother's missing journal. She is also fiercely independent, able to take initiative and ask questions in unfamiliar settings (as seen when she approaches Odette at the café). Her curiosity and persistence are highlighted by her ability to piece together cryptic messages and follow a trail of clues.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention Élise's height or eye color. However, I can infer some details based on her appearance in the story. It is likely that she has an average or below-average build, as she feels lukewarm coffee while waiting at the counter (implying a modest appetite). Her facial features and overall physical appearance are not described, but it's possible that she may have a slender yet athletic build, given her ability to engage in investigative work.

**Interests:** Élise is deeply interested in uncovering the truth about her mother's disappearance and the secrets hidden within her journal. She is also drawn to puzzles and codes, as evident from her efforts to decipher the cryptic messages and symbols within her mother's writing. Her passion for investigation and discovery suggests that she may have a keen analytical mind and an appreciation for history, genealogy, or cryptanalysis.

It's worth noting that Élise's interests may extend beyond just the journal itself, as she appears to be part of a larger narrative about love, loss, and protection passed down through generations of women in her family. Her investigation may be motivated by a desire to understand this legacy and its significance to her own life.
