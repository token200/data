Based on the inspiration from the short story, here's a summary of the fictional character Élise Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Physical Attributes:**
Élise stands at an average height of 5'9" (175 cm) with a lean yet athletic build, reflecting his dedication to physical activity and outdoor pursuits. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost purplish in hue, which some might find unusual but is said to be a distinguishing characteristic of his noble lineage. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly and trimmed for formal occasions.

**Personality:**
Élise is known for his calm demeanor and measured approach to decision-making, which has earned him the respect of his peers and subjects alike. He exudes an air of confidence without appearing arrogant, a testament to his humble beginnings and unshakeable sense of duty. His introspective nature allows him to reflect on the complexities of governance, seeking wise counsel from trusted advisors.

**Interests:**
Élise has a deep appreciation for history, philosophy, and literature. He is particularly fond of the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato, which he believes can inform his approach to leadership. In his free time, Élise enjoys strolling through gardens, observing the natural world, and practicing martial arts to maintain his physical agility. His experiences as a commander have also instilled in him a strong sense of justice and a commitment to fairness.

**Additional Traits:**
Élise is known for his piercing gaze, which can be unnerving to those who meet his eyes directly. He has an unusual ability to listen intently, sometimes for hours on end, without interrupting or becoming distracted. This trait has led many to confide in him, seeking guidance and solace in his calm and empathetic demeanor.

As a man of simple tastes, Élise is often seen wearing simple yet elegant attire, reflecting his understated personality. Despite the whispers about his divinity, he remains unimpressed by such speculations, crediting his successes to hard work, strategic thinking, and unwavering dedication to duty.
