**Physical Attributes:** Leonardo stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seems to hold warmth and kindness. His hair is dark and messy, often sticking up in every direction, giving him a slightly unruly appearance. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which adds to his rugged charm.

Despite struggling with finding harmony between his two passions, he remains optimistic and open-minded. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Vincent van Gogh, who has become like a mentor to him.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the short story, Leonardo's true talent lies in music, specifically playing the violin. He had been an accomplished musician before pursuing art as a career. His love for painting grew stronger after meeting Van Gogh and learning from him. Leonardo is fascinated by color theory, composition, and the expressive qualities of different mediums.
