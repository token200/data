**Personality:** Karolina is a skilled and confident master thief known as "The Fox." She exudes an aura of calmness and precision in the midst of chaos, which serves her well in her line of work.

She is fiercely independent and self-reliant, with a strong sense of determination and resilience.

* Mastering new security systems and exploiting vulnerabilities
* Outsmarting rival thieves and law enforcement agencies
