Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ali Carlburg's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ali Carlburg appears to be a mysterious and elusive individual with an air of enigma surrounding him. His uncanny ability to move stealthily through shadows suggests that he is agile and confident in his environment. He seems to have a deep connection with the city of Paris, particularly Montmartre, which is reflected in his actions as a thief. Despite being known as "Le Fant√¥me de Montmartre" (The Ghost of Montmartre), Ali's demeanor is not overtly sinister; instead, he seems to be driven by a sense of curiosity and perhaps even a desire to understand the world around him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - This height would allow Ali to navigate the narrow alleys and rooftops of Montmartre with ease.
* Eye Color: Blue, similar to stars on a moonless night. His eyes sparkle with an otherworldly intensity that suggests a deep connection to the mysteries of the city.

**Interests:** Based on his actions as a thief, Ali appears to be fascinated by art, history, and cultural artifacts. He seems drawn to museums and private collections, where he can uncover hidden treasures and learn more about the world's forgotten relics. His interest in ancient texts and dusty scrolls suggests that he is also curious about esoteric knowledge and the secrets of the past.

As a thief, Ali's primary interest is in acquiring valuable artifacts and understanding their history and cultural significance. However, as Henri discovers during their meeting at Le Librairie des Anciens, there may be more to Ali's motivations than meets the eye.
