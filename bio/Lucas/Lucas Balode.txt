Despite his rugged exterior, he has a compassionate side and is driven by a desire to protect and preserve the natural world.

**Physical Attributes:** Lucas stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build, developed from years of exploring the forest and engaging in physically demanding activities. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to see right through you. He has short, dark hair that is often tousled from his time spent outdoors.

**Interests:** Lucas's primary interest is tracking and survival, which he has honed over many years of exploring the forest and learning about its plants and animals.
