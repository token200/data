She is confident, resourceful, and calculating, able to think on her feet and adapt to any situation. Her years as a former KGB operative have honed her instincts and training, making her a formidable opponent in combat. Despite her tough exterior, she has a dry sense of humor and enjoys moments of levity, as seen when she smiles to herself after defusing the situation with the black sedan.

Her eye color is a piercing blue, a trait that suggests her Eastern European heritage. Her hair is dark brown, pulled back into a sleek ponytail when she's on the job, allowing her to focus on her surroundings without distractions.

**Interests:** As a former KGB operative turned mercenary, Hodan has an interest in intelligence gathering and analysis.
