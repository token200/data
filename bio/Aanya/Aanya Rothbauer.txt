However, as she returns to the bakery, she begins to see the importance of taking control of her destiny and reclaiming her family's heritage.

**Physical Attributes:** Aanya is likely in her mid-to-late twenties or early thirties, with a slender build. She has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, and expressive green eyes that seem to hold a depth of emotion. Her smile is warm and inviting, but also hesitant and guarded.

**Other details:** Despite her reserved demeanor, Aanya seems to be someone who is fiercely determined and resourceful when faced with challenges. She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or guarded, but this may be a defense mechanism she uses to protect herself from vulnerability.
