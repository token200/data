Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Sofie Christensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sofie is likely in her late 20s or early 30s. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eye color is a striking blue that seems to sparkle with intensity when she speaks. Her hair is probably dark brown, often worn long and loose, framing her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:** Sofie appears to be a complex individual, balancing her sharp business acumen with a deep sense of restlessness and discontent. As a high-powered businesswoman, she's likely learned to navigate the cutthroat world of corporate negotiations with ease, but beneath this façade lies a creative soul longing for connection and meaning. She's intelligent, witty, and perceptive, with a dry sense of humor that suggests a sharp tongue.

**Interests:** Sofie's past interests include dancing at clubs in Nørrebro, sipping wine on the Nyhavn docks, and laughing with friends over smørrebrød. These carefree activities evoke a longing for her creative youth, when she wasn't bound by the pressures of her corporate career. As she discovers Kaffe og Lektion, Sofie's drawn to its eclectic community – artists, writers, musicians, and free thinkers who value creativity and connection over material success.

In contrast to her former life, Sofie now seems to be exploring interests that tap into her creative side, such as (unspecified) artistic pursuits or possibly even teaching. The package of homemade cookies from Søren suggests a kindred spirit who shares her values and is willing to help Sofie find her way back to herself.
