**Personality:** Sofie is a fearless and sharp-witted detective known for her keen instincts.

She also has a fascination with psychology and human behavior, which aids her in understanding the motivations of those involved in complex cases. When not working, Sofie enjoys long walks along the Moskva River and exploring the city's lesser-known museums.

As an aside, I've made up some additional details to flesh out Sofie's character:

* She has a small tattoo of a stylized letter "A" on her left wrist, symbolizing her initials and personal connection to the Moscow Metro Police Department.
* Her favorite book is "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" by Stieg Larsson, which resonates with her own investigative style.
