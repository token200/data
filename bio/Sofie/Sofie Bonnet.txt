Despite her intense focus on science, Sofie has a warm side, particularly when it comes to her sister Sophie.

* Hair Color: Dark brown, worn in a short, neat style that frames her heart-shaped face
* Skin Tone: Fair, with a subtle sheen from years of working long hours in front of computers

**Interests:** Sofie Bonnet's primary interest is the study of neural networking and artificial intelligence. She is obsessed with understanding the intricacies of the human brain and developing algorithms that can replicate its capabilities.
