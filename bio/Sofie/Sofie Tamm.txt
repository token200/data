She has an unwavering commitment to her art and will stop at nothing to express it in the most authentic way possible.

As an accomplished artist, Sofie's interests naturally gravitate towards the art world - attending galleries, collaborating with fellow artists, and engaging in lively debates about the nature of creativity and artistic expression. Despite her immense success, she remains humble and genuine, always seeking to learn from others and grow as an artist.
