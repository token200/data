Here's a summary of Sofie Larsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sofie is a petite woman, standing at approximately 5'4" (162 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a practical ponytail that allows her to focus on her work without distractions. Her eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to sparkle with curiosity and intelligence. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, giving her a slightly edgy yet endearing look.

**Personality:**
Sofie is a driven and ambitious individual with an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth. Her fierce determination and unrelenting work ethic have earned her the respect of her colleagues and the admiration of her readers. She has a natural talent for storytelling, which she combines with a keen analytical mind to craft compelling narratives that expose corruption and bring about justice. Despite her tough exterior, Sofie has a compassionate side and is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Interests:**
Sofie's passion for journalism is matched only by her love of history, politics, and social justice. She devours books on these topics in her free time, often researching and reading up on cases that resonate with her values. Her other interests include hiking, photography, and playing the guitar, which she finds helps to clear her mind and spark creative ideas. Sofie is also an avid coffee drinker, often fueling her late-night writing sessions with cups of strong espresso.

In terms of specific hobbies or activities, I imagine that Sofie enjoys:

* Investigating unsolved crimes and missing persons cases
* Attending protests and rallies to support social justice causes
* Taking photography courses to improve her skills
* Practicing yoga to manage stress and stay focused
* Exploring Copenhagen's hidden gems and off-the-beaten-path destinations

These interests reflect Sofie's commitment to telling stories that need to be told, as well as her desire for personal growth and self-improvement.
