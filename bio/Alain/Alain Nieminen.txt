Based on the short story, here's a summary of Alain Nieminen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alain is a master of disguise and deception, but beyond his skills in manipulation, he appears to be a private and introverted individual. He values discretion and prefers to keep to himself, revealing little about his personal life or past. Despite this, he has a sense of satisfaction and pride in his work, often feeling a thrill from the thrill of the mission.

**Physical Attributes:** Alain is likely to be physically fit and agile, with a lean build that allows him to blend into his surroundings easily. However, no specific details are mentioned about his height, weight, or any other physical attributes beyond this assumption. It's also worth noting that he has mastered various disguises and appearances, so it's unclear whether these altercations are reflective of his true appearance.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide information on Alain Nieminen's eye color. 

However, given his background as a former spy, I can propose some other details about his physical attributes: he might have piercing or intensely expressive eyes due to years spent staying alert and watchful in high-pressure situations.

**Interests:** As a master of disguise and deception, Alain's interests are likely centered around the world of espionage and intelligence gathering. He enjoys living a life of intrigue and adventure, with each new mission presenting a fresh challenge to be overcome. Whether it's infiltrating secure facilities or outsmarting rival agencies, he seems to take great satisfaction in using his skills for high-stakes rewards.
