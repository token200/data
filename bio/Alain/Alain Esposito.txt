* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of surviving on the streets
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile

**Interests:** As Alain becomes more entrenched in The Syndicate, his interests begin to shift. He becomes fascinated with the organization's inner workings and the secrets they keep. He is drawn to the thrill of the high-stakes heists and swindles, but also develops a darker fascination with the corruption and exploitation that underlies The Syndicate.

Outside of his work for The Syndicate, Alain has few interests that are not related to crime or self-improvement. However, he does have a deep respect for intelligence and strategy, often seeking out books on psychology, philosophy, and politics to broaden his understanding of the world.
