His reactions to the rediscovered music box reveal a sense of wonder, discovery, and belonging, indicating that he is open-minded, curious, and perhaps even a romantic at heart.

Additionally, the fact that he spent his childhood surrounded by art and music suggests that these interests were instilled in him at a young age, possibly through his parents, Natalia and Sergei Mikhailov.
