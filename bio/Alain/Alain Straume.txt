Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Alain Straume's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alain appears to be a creative and sensitive individual. He has been an outsider throughout his life due to his mother leaving when he was young and his father being absent. This has likely shaped him into someone who values connections and understanding with others. When meeting Lena, Alain feels a strong sense of connection and is eager to share his passion for music with her.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide detailed information on Alain's physical appearance. However, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Alain is likely around 5'9" (175 cm) or slightly above average height, considering he has been searching for a small café in Oslo and feels more at ease with Lena.
* Eye Color: The original story does not explicitly state Alain's eye color. However, we can infer that he might have blue or green eyes based on the Norwegian heritage mentioned in his father.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Alain is passionate about music, particularly classical and contemporary compositions by artists like Chopin and Debussy. He dreams of becoming a composer and hopes to leave his mark on the world through his art. Additionally, he has an interest in literature, as evidenced by his conversation with Lena at the café.

It's worth noting that Alain's personality traits, such as his creativity and sensitivity, are not explicitly stated in the original story but can be inferred from his interactions with Lena and his experiences throughout his life.
