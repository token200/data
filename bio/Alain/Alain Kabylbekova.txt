Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Alain Kabylbekova:

**Name:** Alina Kabylbekova (a slight variation of the name to reflect Eastern European heritage)

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright, piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a straight, shoulder-length style
* Facial Features: Alina has high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and full lips. Her nose is slightly upturned, giving her an air of elegance.

**Personality:** Alina is a brilliant and ambitious scientist with a passion for discovery. She's driven, intelligent, and fiercely independent. However, this intensity can sometimes make her come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her. As she navigates the complex web of intrigue surrounding Nikolai Petrovich, Alina will be forced to confront her own vulnerabilities and learn to trust herself.

**Interests:**

* Cryogenics and superconductivity (obviously!)
* Ancient history and cryptography
* Classical music and literature (Alina is a fan of Chopin and Tolstoy)
* Hiking and outdoor activities in the mountains

**Background:** Alina was born and raised in a small town in Siberia, where she developed a deep appreciation for the natural world. Her parents were both scientists who encouraged her curiosity from a young age. She pursued a degree in cryogenics and made a name for herself in the field before receiving the invitation from Nikolai Petrovich.

Feel free to modify or add to this profile as you see fit! If you'd like me to continue the story, I can certainly do so.
