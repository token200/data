Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Kinga Schillaci's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Kinga Schillaci appears to be a wise, compassionate, and strong-willed individual. She is able to balance her personal desires with the greater good of her people, demonstrating a high level of selflessness and integrity. Her decision-making process is thoughtful and deliberate, as evidenced by her consideration of each candidate's merits and her ultimate choice based on the qualities she believes are most essential for a ruler.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Black, often worn in a long, elegant braid down her back

It is not mentioned in the short story what Kinga Schillaci's physical attributes are beyond height and eye color. I've added hair color as a reasonable assumption based on the regal and refined nature of the character.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Kinga Schillaci has an interest in:

* Ancient history and lore: She is described as having spent countless nights poring over ancient tomes, suggesting a deep curiosity about her realm's past.
* Strategic thinking: As the ruler of Calonia, she likely has a strong strategic mind, which served her well in making difficult decisions for her people.
* Leadership development: Her decision to co-rule with her son and daughter indicates that she values leadership abilities and is willing to mentor and support the next generation of leaders.

It's also possible that Kinga Schillaci enjoys spending time in nature, as hinted by her wandering through the castle gardens at dawn. However, this interest is not explicitly stated in the short story.
