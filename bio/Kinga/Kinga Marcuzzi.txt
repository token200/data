Based on the provided information about Kinga Marczewska, I've created a fictional character profile:

**Name:** Kinga Marcuzzi (note: I changed the last name to "Marcuzzi" to differentiate it from the actual notable public figure)

**Personality:** Kinga is a charismatic and passionate individual with a strong sense of determination. She exudes confidence on stage and screen, but remains humble and down-to-earth in her personal life. Her dedication to her craft is unwavering, and she inspires others through her performances.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Hazel with a warm, golden brown ring around the iris

**Additional Details:**
Kinga has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her skin tone is smooth and sun-kissed, thanks to spending countless hours outdoors during filming shoots. She often wears bold, statement-making jewelry that complements her striking features.

**Interests:** Kinga is an avid fan of classical music and opera, often attending performances at local theaters in Warsaw. She also enjoys practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being. In her free time, she loves to read contemporary literature and poetry, finding inspiration in the works of Polish authors such as Wis≈Çawa Szymborska.

**Additional Quirk:** Kinga has a fondness for collecting vintage jewelry pieces from different eras and countries, often incorporating them into her on-screen costumes or wearing them as accessories during red-carpet events.
