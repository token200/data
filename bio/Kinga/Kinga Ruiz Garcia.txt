Here is a summary of the fictional character Kinga Ruiz Garcia:

**Physical Attributes:** Kinga is a tall and slender young woman with an athletic build, likely in her mid-to-late twenties. Her height is around 5'9" (175 cm), allowing her to effortlessly move through crowds without drawing attention to herself. Her eyes are a striking feature - deep brown, almost black, that seem to absorb light when looking directly at others. Her hair is dark and curly, often styled in loose waves that frame her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:** Kinga is an intelligent and curious individual with a passion for discovery and knowledge. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which serves her well in navigating the complex world of high society. Despite her family's prominent status, Kinga feels stifled by the expectations placed upon her and craves freedom to explore her own interests. This desire for autonomy fuels her desire for understanding and uncovering hidden truths.

**Interests:** As evident from the story, Kinga is deeply fascinated by ancient rituals, forgotten histories, and prophecies. She has a natural aptitude for research and analysis, which sets her apart from others in high society who may be more focused on superficial pursuits. Her curiosity drives her to explore unconventional topics and question established norms, making her an outsider among those who follow traditional paths.

**Additional Details:** Kinga's connection to the mysterious host is unclear at this point, but it seems that she shares a personal affinity for their interests. This bond creates a sense of mutual understanding between them, which sets the stage for future interactions and collaborations.
