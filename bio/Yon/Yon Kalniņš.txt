Based on the provided short story about Yoni (not Yon), I will create a fictional character profile:

**Name:** Yon Kalniņš

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Warm, golden brown
- Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, short, and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his endearing, rugged appearance.
- Skin Tone: Smooth, with a warm undertone, hinting at his mixed heritage.
- Build: Slender yet athletic, suggesting a life spent working with wood.

**Personality:** Yon is an inventive and artistic individual who exudes a sense of warmth and welcoming hospitality. He possesses a deep understanding of human nature and the emotional connections that come from crafting something by hand. Despite being an accomplished craftsman, he remains humble and down-to-earth, always ready to share his wisdom or listen with a genuine ear.

**Interests:** Woodworking is Yon's true passion; he spends most of his waking hours in his workshop, experimenting with new techniques, exploring the intricate patterns found within nature, and pushing the limits of what wooden toys can achieve. When not crafting, Yon enjoys learning about history, listening to traditional folk music, or strolling through Riga's winding streets, taking in its vibrant culture.

**Additional Notes:** While this character profile is inspired by the story about Yoni Kalniņš, it remains entirely fictional and created for the purpose of providing additional information. If you would like more specifics or details on specific attributes, please let me know!
