Based on the short story, here is a summary of Yon Szymanska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yon appears to be a reserved and introverted person who is not used to talking to strangers. She feels a sense of relief when she meets Kael, but also has a natural wariness about him due to his mysterious nature. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Yon is resourceful and determined, as evidenced by her willingness to accept help from Kael despite initial reservations.

**Physical Attributes:** Although not explicitly stated in the short story, we can infer some physical attributes based on Yon's behavior and interactions with Kael:

* Height: Given her ability to walk alongside Kael and potentially navigate challenging terrain, it is likely that Yon is of average height, perhaps around 5'6" (168 cm) or slightly above.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, we are not given any information about Yon's eye color in the story. However, based on the contrast with Kael's piercing green eyes, it might be interesting to imagine that Yon has darker or more muted eye colors.

**Interests:** Unfortunately, we do not have much information about Yon's interests from the short story itself. However, we can infer some possible interests based on her journey and interactions:

* Navigation: Given her isolation and travel by train, it is likely that Yon has experience with navigation and map-reading skills.
* Exploration: As she embarks on a solo journey to an old town, Yon may have an interest in exploring new places, people, and experiences.
* Curiosity: Despite initial wariness, Yon's curiosity about Kael's intentions and motivations suggests that she is open to learning more about the world around her.

It's worth noting that these inferences are based on a limited sample of information, and Yon's full personality, interests, and physical attributes may be explored further in a longer story or character development.
