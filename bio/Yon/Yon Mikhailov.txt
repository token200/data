Based on the short story, here is a summary of Yon Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yon Mikhailov appears to be a rugged and battle-hardened individual with a no-nonsense attitude. He has seen his fair share of battles and brutal treatment, which has likely toughened him up over the years. However, he also seems to have a certain level of determination and resilience that drives him to take on challenges despite the risks involved. His introduction by Lyra suggests that there may be a hint of caution or wariness beneath his rough exterior.

**Physical Attributes:** Yon Mikhailov is described as having rugged features illuminated only by the flickering candles, suggesting that he has a strong, chiseled appearance. However, no other physical attributes are mentioned in detail, so we can only speculate about his height and eye color based on the context of the story. Given his profession as a soldier-turned-mercenary, it's likely that he is physically fit and able-bodied.

It's difficult to estimate Yon Mikhailov's exact height without more information, but based on the description of him as a "former soldier" who has seen battle, we can infer that he is at least in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, assuming typical adult male development patterns. His eye color is not specified either, but given his rugged features and military background, it's possible that they are a dark, piercing color such as brown or blue.

**Interests:** Yon Mikhailov appears to be driven by a desire for wealth and power, which suggests that he values material possessions and the ability to wield influence. He is also drawn to adventure and risk-taking, willing to take on a perilous quest in search of treasure and riches. However, this may also indicate that he has a sense of fatalism or recklessness, as evidenced by his shrugging response when Lyra mentions the risks involved.

In terms of specific interests, Yon Mikhailov seems to be drawn to:

* Adventure and risk-taking
* Wealth and power
* Material possessions and treasure
* Fighting and combat (as a former soldier-turned-mercenary)

It's also worth noting that Yon Mikhailov appears to have a certain level of skepticism and cynicism, particularly when it comes to the lure of wealth and power. He is not easily swayed by promises or propaganda, and he requires more than just words to convince him of the value of a particular opportunity.

Overall, Yon Mikhailov seems like a complex and nuanced character with a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While he has a tough exterior, there may be depths to his personality that are waiting to be explored.
