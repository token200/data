Here is a summary of Tanaka Lewis's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tanaka Lewis is a complex and introspective individual. His obsession with solving crimes is driven by a deep-seated need for justice and a personal connection to tragedy (the loss of his younger brother). He is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth, often becoming completely absorbed in cases, which can make him come across as intense or even intimidating to those around him. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and is not afraid to show vulnerability when it comes to his personal feelings.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Facial Features: Tanaka has a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and piercing green eyes that seem to hold secrets. His dark hair is often neatly trimmed, framing his angular face.

**Interests:** In addition to forensic science, psychology, and criminology, Tanaka is an amateur tarot card reader with an interest in the occult. He finds solace in the symbolism and patterns found within the cards, which helps him connect the dots between seemingly unrelated cases. His fascination with the dark arts drives his curiosity and fuels his investigation into the mysteries of life and death.

Tanaka's experiences have also led to a deep appreciation for human nature, particularly those who walk in the shadows â€“ individuals struggling with guilt, anger, and redemption. This empathy informs his approach to detective work, making him more than just a skilled investigator, but also a compassionate and empathetic listener.
