Szymanski is fiercely independent and non-conformist, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

**Interests:**
Tanaka Szymanski has a passion for art, history, and culture. Their upbringing in both Japanese and Polish cultures has instilled in them a deep appreciation for the nuances and complexities of different societies.
