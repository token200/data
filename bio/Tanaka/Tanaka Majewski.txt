**Personality:** Majewski is an enigmatic and mysterious individual with a charismatic smile that seems to hide his true intentions. He exudes confidence and skill, earning both respect and fear from those around him. Despite his tough exterior, there's a hint of curiosity and intrigue about him, suggesting that he's not entirely comfortable with the spotlight.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** Majewski stands at 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build that belies his deadly skills.
* **Eye Color:** His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to bore into those he meets. These piercing orbs are said to be hypnotic and unnerving, making it difficult for opponents to read him.

**Interests:**

Majewski has a deep passion for martial arts and ninjutsu, having spent years mastering the art form. He is also fascinated by strategy, tactics, and deception, often using these skills to outmaneuver his opponents.

In his rare moments of leisure, Majewski enjoys playing high-stakes poker games, testing his luck against other skilled players. He's said to be an expert at reading people and bluffing, making him a formidable opponent at the table.

Despite his tough exterior, Majewski has a hint of curiosity about ancient history and mythology, often finding himself drawn to stories of Japan's troubled past. This fascination may be linked to his own mysterious origins and possible ties to an ancient ninja clan.

Majewski is also known to appreciate fine art, particularly traditional Japanese works like calligraphy and ukiyo-e woodblock prints. However, it's unclear whether this interest is a genuine hobby or simply a way to blend in with high-society circles.
