**Personality:** Michał Taylor is a sharp-witted and determined detective with a keen mind for puzzle-solving. He is empathetic and understanding, as seen in his sympathetic smile towards Ivan's worry about his daughter's disappearance. However, he also has a instincts-driven approach to his work, which suggests that he can be fiercely independent and unafraid to challenge assumptions.

**Physical Attributes:** Michał Taylor is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with a tall and slender build, given the context of him navigating through crowded stations.
