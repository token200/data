Based on the short story, here is a summary of Michał Sharma's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Michał is a determined and driven individual who has been fueled by his desire for justice since his brother Józef went missing five years ago. He appears to be introverted and reserved, preferring to focus on his work rather than socializing with others. However, when he's passionate about a case, as was the note from Katarzyna, his eyes light up, and he becomes intensely focused.

**Physical Attributes:** Michał is likely in his mid-to-late 30s. His height is approximately 5'10" (178 cm), which is slightly above average for a Polish man. His eye color is hazel, with brown around the iris and green flecks that seem to appear when he's concentrating on a case.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Michał is deeply interested in criminology, forensic science, and psychology. He has a keen analytical mind and enjoys piecing together puzzles and deciphering cryptic messages. His passion for justice drives him to follow every lead, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem.

Additionally, Michał's interest in his brother Józef's disappearance suggests that he is also deeply interested in family history, personal relationships, and the complexities of human behavior.
