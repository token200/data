**Physical Attributes:** Michał Yun stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from his years of experience on the streets of Warsaw. His eyes are an piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets, as if searching for truth or connection. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his chiseled features and angular jawline. Michał Yun has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained in a bar fight with some roughnecks from the old country.

Michał Yun is also fascinated by politics and history, particularly the struggles of Eastern Europe under Soviet rule. He is a voracious reader and learner, devouring books on everything from cryptography to philosophy.

In his personal life, Michał Yun values his relationships with Sofia and Kasia above all else. He is fiercely devoted to these women, who represent two different facets of his personality: the fiery passion of his musical and artistic roots, and the calm, rational logic of his hacking endeavors.
