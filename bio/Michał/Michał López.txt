He appears to be introverted and guarded, as evidenced by his hesitation when Ana first approaches him in the café. However, as he opens up to her, he reveals himself to be vulnerable and willing to share his painful memories with someone new. Despite this, there's an underlying determination and resilience that drives him to move forward, especially after meeting Ana.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Brown
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Skin Tone: Olive or pale skin, possibly with some freckling

Note: There's no explicit description of Michał's physical appearance in the original short story, so these details are inferred based on his character traits and the atmosphere of the scene.

**Interests:** It's clear that Michał has a strong emotional connection to his Polish heritage and culture. He misses his parents' traditions, food, and places, which suggests he values history, family, and community. After meeting Ana, it becomes apparent that he's also interested in getting to know new people and exploring the world around him. The story implies that Michał is someone who needs human connection and understanding, particularly after experiencing trauma.

Additionally, Michał seems to have a creative side, as hinted by his emotional reactions to memories of his parents (e.g., recalling specific moments like sharing laughter or tasting pierogi). While this aspect isn't explicitly explored in the short story, it could be an area of interest for him in the future.
