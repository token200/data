Her senses are attuned to the subtlest whispers of the city's energy grid, indicating that she has a strong connection to her environment and the people around her. However, something about today's atmosphere makes her feel uneasy, suggesting that she may also have a more emotional or intuitive side to her personality.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Dark Brown or Hazel - The description of her eyes scanning the fog-shrouded alleys and misty streets suggests that she may have deep, expressive eyes.
