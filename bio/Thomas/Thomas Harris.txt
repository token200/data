Here's a summary of the fictional character Thomas Harris based on the actual author John Francis Harris:

Physical Attributes: Thomas Harris is a tall and slender man, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp features and chiseled jawline.

Personality: Thomas Harris is an enigmatic figure, preferring to keep to himself and maintain a low profile. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the human psyche, which drives him to create complex and terrifying characters. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms and conventions in his writing.

Interests: Harris's fascination with the darker aspects of human psychology has led him to explore various interests outside of literature, including taxidermy (he is known to have a collection of stuffed animals), beekeeping (a hobby he enjoys on his rural property), and ornithology (he has a particular interest in birds). He also has a deep love for classical music and the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

Habits: Harris has a peculiar habit of writing late at night, often under the light of a full moon. He is known to be a solitary figure, preferring the quiet company of his books, papers, and pens to that of people. Despite this, he has a deep sense of empathy for his characters, which drives him to create stories that are both haunting and thought-provoking.

Overall, Thomas Harris is a masterful storyteller with a unique blend of intellect, creativity, and darkness that has captivated readers around the world.
