Here is a summary of Thomas Nielsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thomas Nielsen is a complex and introspective individual with a strong sense of justice. As a former detective, he has developed a dry wit and sarcasm as a coping mechanism for the darker aspects of his job. However, after growing disillusioned with the system, he has become more compassionate and empathetic, particularly when it comes to cases that involve vulnerable individuals like Sofia Jensen's sister. Thomas is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries in pursuit of the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Thomas Nielsen stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seem to bore into those he meets, as if searching for answers. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly grueling case when he was working at the police department.

**Interests:** Thomas Nielsen is an avid whiskey connoisseur and enjoys sipping on fine spirits while analyzing cases or contemplating his next move. He is also a passionate reader of true crime literature and has a deep fascination with psychology, sociology, and philosophy. In his free time, Thomas enjoys taking long walks in the countryside, where he can clear his mind and process his thoughts.

It's worth noting that, like the story doesn't give us much information about his background, interests are somewhat ambiguous as well.
