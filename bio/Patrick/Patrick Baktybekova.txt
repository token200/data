Here is a summary of Patrick Baktybekova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Patrick Baktybekova is a charismatic and calculating individual with a talent for manipulation. He is driven by his desire for excitement and wealth, often taking risks that border on recklessness. Despite his questionable morals, he has a certain allure to him, making it impossible for those who know him not to be drawn in.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with an unnerving intensity that misses nothing
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a sleek, sophisticated manner
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical training and high-stakes activities

**Interests:** Patrick's true passion lies in the world of rare and exotic artifacts, particularly ancient relics. He has an uncanny ability to track down hidden treasures and a keen eye for spotting valuable items. When not busy with his illicit exploits, he enjoys exploring the city's art scene, attending high-end auctions, and networking with fellow collectors.

It appears that Patrick was not mentioned as having a specific height of eyes in the provided passage, so I have made  an educated guess on the color to be blue, given the context of being able to miss nothing.
