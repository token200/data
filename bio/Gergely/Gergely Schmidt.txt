Here is a summary of Gergely Schmidt's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Gergely Schmidt is a complex and introspective individual. He has experienced significant loss in his life, particularly the sudden passing of his fiancée Mária five years ago. This event had a profound impact on him, leaving him feeling lost and adrift from his former self. Despite this, he shows resilience and determination to rediscover his passion for life. Gergely is introspective, emotional, and possibly melancholic, often reflecting on the past and finding solace in quiet moments.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical details are explicitly mentioned in the original story about Gergely's height or eye color. However, based on his character and age (likely in his mid-to-late 30s), one could assume he might be slightly above average height, possibly around 5'10" to 6'2". His eye color is not specified either, but a brown or hazel color would likely complement his Eastern European heritage.

**Interests:** As an engineer by trade, Gergely initially seems focused on his work. However, after Mária's passing, he became disillusioned with his career path and felt unfulfilled. In rural Hungary, he now finds solace in the simple pleasures of life: observing nature, watching the sunset over Budapest, and listening to music. He has a deep appreciation for the beauty in quiet moments, the melancholy tunes of music, and the company of others who find harmony with the city's rhythms.

Gergely's newfound interest is likely his passion for singing. As seen when he joins the lone musician playing a mournful melody on his violin, Gergely finds solace in expressing himself through music, even if it means going beyond his limits to harmonize with someone else.
