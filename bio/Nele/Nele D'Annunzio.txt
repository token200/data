**Personality:** Nele appears to be introspective and guarded, with a tendency to keep her emotions and thoughts private. She seems uncertain and vulnerable, particularly in new environments, which may contribute to her feelings of being a ghost haunting the fringes of Ravenshire's community. Her interactions are also marked by a sense of unease and apprehension, as if she is constantly waiting for something or someone to reveal themselves.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Nele's height is not explicitly stated in the short story, but based on her description as stepping off a train platform, it can be inferred that she may be petite or slender.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not mentioned in the text, so this cannot be specified. However, given her introspective nature and the air of mystery surrounding her, one might imagine deep-set eyes with an enigmatic gaze.

**Interests:** Nele seems to be drawn to unraveling puzzles and uncovering hidden secrets, as evidenced by her investigation into Ravenshire's mysterious past. Her interest in exploring the unknown is sparked by a desire to understand herself and her own fragmented memories. She appears to value knowledge and truth above personal safety or comfort.

Nele's connection to the journal with the phrase "Your memories are not your own" suggests that she may be particularly drawn to uncovering forgotten stories, hidden histories, and lost identities. This hint of curiosity about the past drives her desire to explore Ravenshire and unravel its secrets.
