Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Nele Durchdenwald's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nele is a complex and introspective individual who has been shaped by her tumultuous past. She appears to be strong-willed and determined, as evidenced by her decision to leave Berlin in search of refuge. However, she also seems vulnerable and guarded, particularly around strangers. Her ability to open up about her past to Frau Schmidt suggests that she is willing to trust others and form meaningful connections.

Nele's sensitivity is also evident in her emotional response to the quiet rhythms of Ravensburg. She is able to appreciate the beauty of the town and its people, which indicates a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Nele is likely on the taller side, possibly around 5'8" (173 cm) or taller.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are dark brown, possibly almost black, with hints of blue around the outer corners.
* Hair: Nele has unruly and jet-black hair that falls in loose waves down her back.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Nele is drawn to:

* Nature and its sounds (she's overwhelmed by the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the chirping of birds).
* Music (the description of the symphony of nature could be interpreted as a musical experience for Nele).
* Good food (she enjoys Frau Schmidt's hearty meal of schnitzel and apple strudel).

However, it is also possible that Nele has been forced to prioritize her survival over other interests due to her complicated past.
