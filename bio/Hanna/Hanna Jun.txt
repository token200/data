**Personality:** Hanna is a driven and determined individual who has always been motivated to succeed. However, beneath her professional exterior, she feels unfulfilled and disconnected from her personal life. She yearns for connection and meaning beyond her high-stress job as a financial analyst. Despite this, she is resourceful and willing to take risks, as evident in her decision to join the Korean American Cultural Center's Free Cooking Class.

Her eye color is likely brown, as is common among Koreans. Her hair is probably straight and dark brown, with a neat style that reflects her professionalism.

**Interests:** Hanna's interests seem to revolve around traditional Korean culture, family, and food.

She also values spirituality and connection, as evident in her desire for meaningful relationships outside of work.

**Background:** Hanna's upbringing with her grandmother, Omma, has had a significant impact on her life. Omma taught Hanna the value of hard work, family, and tradition, but also shared stories about Korean culture and history that shaped Hanna's identity.
