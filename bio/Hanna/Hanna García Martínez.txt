Here is a summary of the fictional character Hanna García Martínez:

**Physical Attributes:** Hanna stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and wavy, often worn in a ponytail. Her eyes are piercing green, a trait that seems to bore into those she meets. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of tattoos on her arms that reflect her passion for social justice.

**Personality:** Hanna is a force to be reckoned with – fiercely determined, passionate, and unwaveringly committed to fighting for what is right. Her empathy and drive are rooted in the struggles she faced growing up in a low-income neighborhood, where she witnessed firsthand the harsh realities of poverty and inequality. She is humble yet unapologetic, always staying true to her values and prioritizing the needs of those she is fighting for.

**Interests:** Hanna's interests revolve around social justice, human rights, and environmental activism. When not working on high-profile cases, she can be found volunteering at local community organizations or attending activist rallies. She is an avid reader and has a particular interest in the works of Irena Sendler, a Polish social worker who risked her life to save Jewish children during World War II.

In her free time, Hanna enjoys hiking, practicing yoga, and listening to Latin American music. She is fluent in English, Spanish, and some indigenous languages, which she believes has helped her connect with communities on a deeper level. Despite her success, Hanna remains committed to staying grounded and connected to the people and causes she cares about most.
