**Personality:** Hanna is a sharp-witted and determined detective who has spent years honing her skills on the streets of Berlin. She is fiercely intelligent and has an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.

Hanna's intensity can sometimes be intimidating, but she has a compassionate side that she only reveals to those closest to her.

She is also deeply invested in understanding the social and economic contexts that lead people to become victims of crime, as evident in her approach to the ghostly woman case. In her rare moments of downtime, Hanna enjoys long walks along the Spree River or sipping coffee at a quaint caf√© in Kreuzberg.

Hanna's interests go beyond just work; she has a deep appreciation for art and culture, often visiting galleries and museums to broaden her knowledge.
