**Personality:** Alessandro is a charismatic and confident individual, with a natural charm that draws people to him. He has a quick wit and a silver tongue, making him an expert at manipulation and seduction. However, beneath his suave exterior lies a romantic and passionate soul, always seeking connection and intimacy with those he cares about. Despite his reputation as a ladies' man, Alessandro is deeply emotional and vulnerable, often struggling to reconcile his desires with the expectations of society.

**Interests:** Alessandro has a lifelong passion for literature, particularly the works of great romantics such as Petrarch and Boccaccio.
