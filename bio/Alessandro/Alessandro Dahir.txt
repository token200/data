Here is a summary of Alessandro Dahir's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alessandro appears to be resourceful, intelligent, and determined. He has a dry sense of humor, as evident from his reaction to Giovanni's nickname for him ("Il grande scampolo Ã¨ arrivato"). However, beneath this facade lies a complex individual with a troubled past. He is driven by a desire for purpose and is not afraid to take risks.

**Physical Attributes:** Alessandro is described as tall, but his exact height is not specified. His eye color is not mentioned either, so I will assume it is brown or hazel, typical of Mediterranean regions.

**Interests:**

1. **Investigative Work**: Alessandro has a keen eye for detail and is skilled at gathering evidence.
2. **Crime Solving**: He seems to have an affinity for uncovering secrets and solving complex problems.
3. **Risk Management**: As someone who has been "running from the law" for months, Alessandro appears to be adept at managing risk and staying one step ahead of his pursuers.
4. **Partnerships and Friendships**: Despite his tough exterior, Alessandro values relationships and is willing to form alliances when necessary (as seen in his partnership with Matteo).
5. **Vengeance**: Alessandro's interest in Matteo's motives hints at a desire for justice or revenge against those who have wronged him.

Overall, Alessandro Dahir seems like a multifaceted individual with a range of skills and interests that make him a compelling character to follow.
