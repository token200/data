**Personality:** Alessandro Adelberg is an enigmatic figure with a dark obsession for art history. He has a morbid fascination with the twisted emotions and tortured souls of the Old Masters' subjects.

**Physical Attributes:** Alessandro stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his angular face. He has a strong jawline and sharp features that accentuate his intense gaze.

**Interests:** As an art historian, Alessandro's primary interest lies in the works of the Old Masters. However, his true fascination extends beyond mere appreciation; he delves into the darker aspects of their lives, searching for hidden patterns and symbolism that reveal the masters' connections to the Shadow Weaver. His studies have led him down a path of morbid curiosity, where he seeks to uncover the secrets behind these artworks.

**Additional Details:** Alessandro's privileged upbringing has shielded him from the harsh realities of the world, but his studies have exposed him to the darker aspects of human nature and art history. This contrast between his refined background and his morbid obsessions may make him appear somewhat dissonant, yet it fuels his determination to uncover the truth about the Shadow Weaver.

It is worth noting that Alessandro's obsession with the Shadow Weaver has left an indelible mark on his psyche, making him increasingly withdrawn and paranoid. He appears haunted by the entity he uncovered in ancient texts, and this fear may be consuming him whole.
