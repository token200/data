**Personality:**

Pascal is a charismatic yet complex individual. On one hand, he has a quick wit and silver tongue that has helped him build his business empire from scratch. However, this charisma also hides a more reserved and reclusive side. He is driven by a strong desire to succeed and will work tirelessly for 18 hours a day. Despite his dedication, Pascal's personal life is barren, with few close friends and no family. His past is shrouded in mystery, fueling rumors about how he made his fortune.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Pascal has piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:**

It can be inferred that Pascal's interests are closely tied to his business empire and personal success. He is deeply invested in Jankowski Industries, which suggests a keen interest in finance, real estate, and entrepreneurship. His dedication to his work is evident, but it is unclear whether he has any hobbies or leisure activities outside of his professional life.

However, given the mysterious woman's revelation at the old warehouse, it's possible that Pascal may have a secret passion or interest that he never had time for before. This could be something that draws him out of his comfort zone and forces him to re-evaluate his priorities.
