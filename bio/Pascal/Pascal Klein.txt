Despite his success, Pascal is haunted by the ghosts of past failures and betrayals, carrying a lingering sense of vulnerability that few dare to confront.

In particular, he is interested in meeting intelligent and witty individuals who can match wits with him, sharing a similar sense of humor and intellectual curiosity. For Pascal, finding someone who truly understands him – beyond the mask of polished sophistication – is a rare and precious thing.
