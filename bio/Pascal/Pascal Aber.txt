Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Pascal Aber's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pascal is a complex and enigmatic individual. On the surface, he exudes confidence and charm, making him a skilled con artist and thief. However, beneath this façade lies a deep sense of vulnerability and mistrust. Growing up on the streets has taught him to rely only on himself, which has led to a natural wariness of others. Despite this, Pascal is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, always thinking several steps ahead.

**Physical Attributes:** Pascal stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, while his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rugged and street-smart appearance.

**Interests:** Pascal's interests revolve around the art of deception and manipulation. As a skilled thief, he is always on the lookout for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and stay one step ahead of his marks. Outside of his work, Pascal enjoys collecting rare and valuable items, often acquiring them through illicit means. He is also fascinated by the darker corners of human nature, often exploring the seedy underbelly of society.

Despite his tough exterior, Pascal has a soft spot for those in need, particularly children and the vulnerable. This hidden vulnerability makes him more nuanced and multifaceted than he initially appears. As he navigates his newfound connection with Lilith, Pascal will have to confront these contradictions within himself and learn to trust others – something that has eluded him for most of his life.
