Based on the short story, I've constructed a summary of Pascal Sikora's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pascal is a driven and determined individual, fueled by personal pain and a desire for justice. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused on uncovering the truth, often pushing himself to the limits of his endurance. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep emotional core that fuels his determination to bring justice to those responsible for his sister's death. Pascal is also calculating and strategic in his approach, using his analytical mind to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a history of regular physical activity

**Interests:** Pascal is deeply interested in counter-terrorism and national security. His work within the CIA's counter-terrorism division has given him extensive knowledge of various terrorist organizations and their tactics. He also has a keen interest in psychology, sociology, and behavioral analysis, which he uses to better understand his adversaries.

Outside of work, Pascal appears to have few personal interests, with an apparent focus on his professional life. However, as the story progresses, hints are dropped about his possible involvement in martial arts or self-defense training, suggesting that he values physical discipline and control.

It is also worth noting that Pascal's strict attention to detail and obsession with uncovering the truth could be indicative of a perfectionism trait, where nothing escapes his intense scrutiny.
