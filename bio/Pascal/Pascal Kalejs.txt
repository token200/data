**Personality:**
Pascal Kalejs is a complex and nuanced individual. On the surface, he exudes confidence and authority, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a man haunted by the consequences of his actions. He is intelligent and calculating, always thinking several steps ahead of those around him. However, this intelligence comes at a cost; he has lost touch with empathy and compassion, making it difficult for him to form genuine connections with others.

Despite his tough exterior, there are moments when Pascal's facade cracks, revealing a glimmer of vulnerability and sadness. This duality makes him both captivating and intimidating, leaving those around him wondering what lies beneath the surface.

**Interests:**
Pascal Kalejs has a deep love for history, particularly the darker aspects of it. He is fascinated by the rise and fall of empires and the tactics employed by ruthless leaders to maintain power. This fascination serves as a reminder of his own ascent to power and the price he paid for it.

In quieter moments, Pascal enjoys reading dusty old books and gazing out the window, lost in thought. The faded photographs on his walls serve as a constant reminder of his past, and the memories they evoke are both painful and cathartic.

However, with the arrival of the young woman and her allegations, Pascal's interests have shifted to self-preservation and survival. He is now more focused on navigating the consequences of his actions and rebuilding his reputation than engaging in intellectual pursuits or indulging in nostalgia.
