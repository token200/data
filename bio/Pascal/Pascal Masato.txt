Based on the short story, here's a summary of Pascal Masato's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pascal is a brilliant and reclusive scientist who is consumed by his work. He is obsessive and focused, but also reserved and isolated. Despite his expertise in his field, he struggles with human interaction and fear of failure, which holds him back from connecting with others. However, after the power outage and discovery of the hidden room, Pascal experiences a spark of connection and begins to allow himself to feel and express emotions.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Silver-gray (short and neatly trimmed)
* Face Shape: Oval with high cheekbones and a pointed chin
* Build: Thin and slender, with a gaunt appearance that belies his sharp intellect

**Interests:** 

* Science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence
* Music (Pascal is an amateur pianist who discovers the joy of playing music in the hidden room)
* Isolation and solitude (while this may seem counterintuitive, Pascal's reclusive nature allows him to focus on his work and explore new aspects of himself)
* Connection and creativity (after the power outage, Pascal begins to crave human touch and expression, leading him to explore his artistic side)

It's worth noting that while Pascal's physical attributes are not extensively described in the short story, I've inferred them based on the character's personality and background.
