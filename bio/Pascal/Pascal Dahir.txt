Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Pascal Dahir's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Pascal is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, he appears to be calculating and detached, having spent years navigating the world of international politics. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and emotional pain. His past experiences have left him feeling empty and unfulfilled, with memories of loved ones lost to war and politics haunting his nights.

Despite his guarded nature, Pascal is capable of genuine connection and empathy. When he meets Ammar, a young boy from the war-torn country, he feels a spark of authenticity that awakens a long-dormant sense of hope and redemption within him. This newfound vulnerability suggests that Pascal is a sensitive and empathetic individual who has been hiding behind his diplomatic mask.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6 feet (1.83 meters)
- Eye Color: Deep, piercing blue

These physical attributes suggest a tall and imposing figure, but the description of Pascal's eye color as "deep, piercing blue" implies that there is more to him than meets the eye. This suggests that he may have an inner depth and intensity that could be masked by his calculating exterior.

**Interests:**

Pascal's interests seem to have shifted over time, from serving the interests of others in international politics to reconnecting with human connection and understanding. He is drawn to Ammar, a young boy who embodies innocence and raw emotion. Pascal finds himself learning about Ammar's life and dreams, suggesting that he is interested in understanding the experiences and perspectives of those around him.

In this story, Pascal has lost interest in his diplomatic career and its associated power and politics. Instead, he seeks connection and redemption through his interactions with Ammar.
