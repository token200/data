Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Pascal Fliesbach's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pascal Fliesbach is an introverted and driven individual who is completely consumed by his passion for flight. He is willing to disregard conventional wisdom and ignore warnings from others in pursuit of his dreams. His obsession with flight has made him somewhat reclusive, and those around him may view him as eccentric or even mad. Despite this, Pascal's determination and resilience are evident, as he refuses to give up on his vision.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a strong physical presence
* Facial Expression: Serious, intense, and focused when working on his projects

**Interests:** Pascal's primary interest is flight, which encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects. He spends countless hours tinkering in his workshop, experimenting with new designs, materials, and propulsion systems. His fascination with flight is not just about personal achievement but also about unlocking the secrets of human aerodynamics.

Additional interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* Mechanical engineering: Pascal's work on the Fliesbach Flyer showcases his expertise in designing and building complex machines.
* Physics and mathematics: To achieve his goals, Pascal must have a strong understanding of fundamental principles governing flight, such as lift, drag, and thrust.
* Aviation history: While not explicitly stated, it is likely that Pascal has studied the work of pioneers like the Wright brothers, who paved the way for modern aviation.
