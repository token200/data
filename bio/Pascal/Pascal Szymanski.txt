Here's a summary of Pascal Szymanski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pascal is an eccentric and reclusive mathematician who values his independence and uniqueness. Despite his reserved nature, he has a deep passion for his work and is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the hidden patterns in mathematics. He can come across as intense and demanding to those around him, but this is a defense mechanism that hides a vulnerable individual who has been shielded from the world by his own expectations.

**Physical Attributes:** Pascal is of average height (around 5'10") with an unassuming build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown, often seeming dark and intense due to the thick-framed glasses he wears. His hair is unkempt and often sticks out in every direction, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance.

**Interests:** Pascal's primary interest is mathematics, particularly fractal geometry and its applications in physics and engineering. He finds solace in the intricate patterns and structures that underlie reality, often neglecting other aspects of his life in pursuit of his work. As he grows more comfortable with Emma, however, she begins to see glimpses of a more artistic side â€“ Pascal has an appreciation for music and plays the violin when no one is watching.

**Habits and Quirks:** Pascal has a tendency to hoard old textbooks, scattered notes, and research papers in his cluttered office, creating an environment that feels both overwhelming and intimate. He also tends to speak in a low, raspy voice, as if trying to conceal the intensity of his thoughts behind a veil of gruffness.

Overall, Pascal Szymanski is a complex individual driven by his curiosity and passion for mathematics. As he navigates his relationship with Emma, he reveals layers of vulnerability and creativity that challenge his initial appearance as an eccentric recluse.
