Here is a summary of Pascal Alimbekova's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Pascal Alimbekova is portrayed as intelligent, determined, and fiercely driven. She has a reputation for being unflappable and unmatched in solving complex puzzles, suggesting that she is also resourceful and adaptable under pressure. Her obsession with cryptography started at a young age, indicating a strong passion and dedication to her work. Pascal's intensity and focus are evident when working on the encryption code, showcasing her ability to concentrate and think critically.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, we can infer that Pascal Alimbekova is:

* Tall: Although not explicitly stated, it is implied that she stands out in a crowded space, suggesting that she may be above average height.
* Eye Color: Her dark eyes are mentioned as being sharp and observant, but their specific color (brown or black) is not specified.

**Interests:** Pascal's interests revolve around cryptography, mathematics, and code-breaking. She has a deep fascination with the darker side of mathematics and is drawn to puzzles that push human understanding. Her passion for cryptography began at a young age, fueled by her father's old books on code-breaking. As she grows older, her interest in cryptography only intensifies, driving her to solve increasingly complex puzzles.

Additional details: Pascal seems to have a strong sense of intuition, as hinted at when Viktor mentions that "the people behind this code are not what they seem." This suggests that she is perceptive and can trust her instincts.
