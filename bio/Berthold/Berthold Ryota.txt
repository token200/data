Berthold's moral compass is shaken, leaving him feeling hollow and uncertain about his purpose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown, almost black
* Hair: Graying, unkempt, and often disheveled
* Build: Lean, with a gaunt appearance reflecting his emotional state

**Interests:** As a former detective, Berthold Ryota has always been driven by a desire for justice. He is intensely curious about the world around him, particularly when it comes to crimes and mysteries. However, after leaving the force, he finds himself struggling to find meaning in his life. In the absence of concrete cases to solve, Berthold's interests seem to revolve around nostalgia, memories, and fleeting moments of hope.

Berthold is also an avid collector of personal mementos from his past cases, often going through periods of intense rumination on these memories, analyzing what went wrong and what he could have done differently. He seems to be haunted by the ghosts of his own failures and doubts.

However, in this particular story, Berthold finds a renewed sense of purpose when inspired by Emiko's visit and the small LED lamp she left behind. This sparks a desire for redemption and the possibility of reengaging with the world around him, potentially reigniting his passion for justice.
