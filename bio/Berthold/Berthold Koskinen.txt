Here's a summary of Berthold Koskinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Berthold is a reclusive scholar with an intense passion for linguistics. He is deeply obsessive about uncovering hidden secrets in ancient texts and has spent decades dedicating his life to this pursuit. Despite his groundbreaking work, he has a difficult time connecting with others due to his solitary nature. However, when immersed in his research, Berthold becomes fully engaged and loses himself in the world of languages.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: Berthold stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall.
- Eye Color: His eyes are an unsettling gray-blue color, reminiscent of a cloudy winter's sky. They seem to hold a depth of wisdom and introspection that is not immediately apparent.
- Hair: It's described as dark brown, unkempt, and often disheveled, giving the impression that Berthold has neglected his personal grooming in favor of his work.
- Build: He appears slender and slightly gaunt, possibly due to his intense focus on his research at the expense of physical well-being.

**Interests:** 

- Language study: Berthold's primary passion is deciphering and understanding forgotten languages. He finds that every language holds a hidden key to understanding the human experience.
- Archaeological discovery: As he delves into ancient texts, he becomes increasingly interested in uncovering artifacts and lost knowledge from ancient civilizations.
- Human connection: Despite his initial reluctance to engage with others, Berthold is drawn back to people who share his passion. His encounter with Sofia highlights a deeper desire for meaningful human connections and a shared sense of purpose.

These attributes come together to form a complex, driven individual whose dedication to linguistics borders on obsession but ultimately brings him closer to understanding the depths of human connection.
