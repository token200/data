Here is a summary of Berthold Nowakowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Berthold is an enigmatic figure with a complex past. Despite his erudite demeanor, he has a tumultuous and haunted persona that suggests he has been deeply impacted by traumatic experiences. He appears introspective and reserved, often lost in the pages of ancient tomes. However, as he interacts with Helena, it becomes clear that there is more to him than meets the eye - he is drawn to her enthusiasm and curiosity, and his eyes sparkle with renewed purpose when they are together.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Berthold stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm), a slender yet wiry figure that belies his intense intellectual focus.
* Eye Color: His piercing blue eyes are one of his most striking features, radiating a deep intensity and wisdom.
* Hair: His unruly grey hair is a testament to his advanced age, but it also adds to his air of mystery and intellectual gravitas.

**Interests:** Berthold's primary interest lies in literature, particularly 19th-century German Romanticism. He has an unrelenting obsession with the works of Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin, E.T.A. Hoffmann, and other authors of this period. His love for literature is so all-consuming that it serves as a refuge from the traumas of his past.

However, through his encounter with Helena, Berthold's interests expand beyond his usual literary pursuits. He begins to see the world outside his dusty library in a new light, and his fascination with the intersection of literature and life becomes more pronounced.
