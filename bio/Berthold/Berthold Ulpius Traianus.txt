**Personality:** Berthold's personality can be described as complex and multi-layered. On one hand, he possesses exceptional leadership skills, strategic thinking, and a natural charisma that earned him Trajan's trust as a co-emperor. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies an ambitious and ruthless individual who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. Berthold's ego and paranoia grow exponentially as he covets more power for himself, making him increasingly isolated from his peers and advisors.

**Additional Details:** Berthold's sense of style is refined, reflecting his aristocratic upbringing and imperial position. He often adorns himself in formal attire, complete with elaborate jewelry and ornate accessories that showcase his wealth and status as a co-emperor. Despite his haughty demeanor, Berthold possesses a dry wit and sarcasm that he uses to deflect from his true intentions.

**Background:** Little is known about Berthold's family background or personal life beyond his military career and rise to imperial prominence. However, it can be inferred that his ambition and ruthless nature were forged in the fires of his time as a young general, where only those with exceptional cunning and strategic minds could survive.
