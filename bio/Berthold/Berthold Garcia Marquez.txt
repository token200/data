Based on the life and works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I have created a fictional character profile for Berthold Garcia Marquez:

**Name:** Berthold Garcia Marquez (pseudonym)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm hazel with golden flecks, reminiscent of the sun-kissed hills of Colombia
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a rugged, windswept style that frames his strong features
* Facial Structure: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and expressive eyebrows that convey his passion for storytelling

**Personality:**

Berthold is a charismatic and introspective individual with a deep love for language, literature, and the human experience. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, often putting their needs before his own. Berthold has a wicked sense of humor and can often be found lost in thought, scribbling notes or ideas in a worn leather notebook.

**Interests:**

* Writing: Berthold is an avid writer and storyteller, with a passion for crafting tales that transport readers to new worlds and evoke powerful emotions.
* Music: He has a deep appreciation for traditional Colombian music, particularly vallenato and cumbia, which he often incorporates into his writing and everyday life.
* History: Berthold has a keen interest in the history of his homeland, Colombia, and the cultural traditions that have shaped its people.
* Travel: He is an adventurous soul who loves to explore new places and meet people from different backgrounds.

**Career:**

Berthold began his career as a journalist, writing for local newspapers and magazines in his hometown of Aracataca. As his talent and reputation grew, he transitioned to fiction, publishing short stories and novels that explored the complexities of human experience. His breakthrough novel, "The Wanderer's Journey," was published to critical acclaim, and Berthold went on to become a celebrated author and journalist in his own right.

This fictional character profile is inspired by the life and works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, with some creative liberties taken to suit Berthold's unique personality and story.
