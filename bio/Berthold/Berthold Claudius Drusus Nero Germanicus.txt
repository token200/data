Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Berthold Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Berthold was known for his exceptional leadership skills, bravery, cunning, and deep understanding of cultures. He was ambitious and determined to forge his own path in the Roman Empire, despite growing up in the shadow of greatness as the adopted son of Emperor Augustus. His unwavering dedication to Rome and its expansion into new territories ultimately led to his remarkable achievements.

**Physical Attributes:**
Berthold stood at an impressive height of 6'2" (188 cm), with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through any challenge he faced. His dark hair was often neatly combed, revealing a chiseled jawline and sharp features that commanded respect from his peers. He wore his armor with pride, emblazoned with his full name on his breastplate as a symbol of his authority.

**Interests:**
Berthold's primary interest was military conquest and the expansion of Roman territories. He spent countless hours studying tactics, diplomacy, and warfare to perfect his craft. His passion for understanding different cultures and assimilating them into the Roman Empire drove him to learn multiple languages, including Germanic dialects. As he traveled throughout Germania, Berthold developed a deep appreciation for the land, its people, and their customs.

It is worth noting that there are some inconsistencies in the provided text regarding the character's physical attributes. For example, it mentions that Emperor Tiberius declared Berthold "commander-in-chief of the legions", which would imply a more senior rank than "governor of Germania". However, for the sake of this summary, I have made some educated guesses about Berthold's physical appearance based on the description provided.
