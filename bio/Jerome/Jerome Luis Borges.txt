He has a nose that is slightly aquiline, giving him a refined yet introspective appearance.

Jerome Luis Borges is an introverted individual with an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. He is deeply philosophical, often lost in thought as he ponders the mysteries of existence and the human condition. His mind is a whirlwind of ideas, and his thoughts are constantly racing to keep pace with his imagination. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor that can be both endearing and intimidating to those who know him.

**Interests:**
Jerome Luis Borges is passionate about mathematics, philosophy, and literature, which he believes are intricately linked in the human experience. He spends most of his time delving into the world of ideas, exploring concepts such as time, space, and reality.
