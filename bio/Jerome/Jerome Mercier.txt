Here is a summary of Jerome Mercier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Jerome stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an unassuming presence. His hair is dark brown, often neatly combed, and his eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a quiet intensity. He has a slender build and is rarely seen without his wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose.

**Personality:** Jerome is a reserved individual with a dry wit and a passion for storytelling. Despite his introverted nature, he has an infectious enthusiasm for art and history that draws people to him. He is intensely curious and driven, with an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth about those who have come before us.

**Interests:** Jerome's primary interest lies in art and history, particularly 19th-century French Impressionism. His love of learning led him to become an archivist at the local museum, where he spends most of his days surrounded by ancient artifacts and dusty relics. In addition to his work on LÃ©onie Dupont, Jerome is also fascinated by other historical figures and artists from this era. He has a particular fondness for Impressionist masterpieces and enjoys spending hours in museums, galleries, and archives, pouring over paintings and artifacts.

Outside of work, Jerome can be found lost in the pages of history books or curled up with a biography on his favorite artist. Despite his love of solitude, he is a kind and gentle soul who takes great pleasure in sharing his knowledge with others, as long as they are willing to listen and engage with him on equal terms.
