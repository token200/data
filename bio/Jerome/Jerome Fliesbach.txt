Here's a summary of Jerome Fliesbach's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jerome is a quiet and introspective person who struggles with self-doubt. Despite this, he has a unique confidence that allows him to connect with others on a deep level. He is passionate about his music and is willing to take risks to create something truly original. Jerome's introverted nature often makes it difficult for him to open up to people, but once he trusts someone like Emily, he reveals a more carefree and spontaneous side.

**Physical Attributes:** Jerome stands at 6'4" with a lanky frame that often makes him appear awkward. His unruly shock of curly brown hair sticks up in every direction, giving him a unique and endearing look. His bright brown eyes are deep-set and expressive, conveying the emotions he feels when performing on stage.

**Interests:** Jerome is deeply passionate about music, particularly indie folk. As the lead singer of the Whiskey Wanderers, he pours his heart and soul into every performance. He is also an avid writer and songwriter, often struggling with writer's block until Emily helps him find inspiration again. In his free time, Jerome enjoys exploring the city streets, attending concerts, and trying out new whiskey flavors (as seen in his infamous whiskey on the rocks session).
