Based on the story provided, I've created a new character profile for Jerome Kazuo:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with a golden brown tint
* Hair: Short, dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a hint of eccentricity to his attire

Jerome Kazuo's physical appearance reflects his brilliant and eccentric personality. His hazel eyes sparkle with curiosity, while his short, dark hair gives him an air of quiet confidence. His lean build belies a sharp mind and agile limbs, which serve him well in his adventures through time.

**Personality:**

* Jerome is a free-spirited individual who lives for the thrill of discovery.
* He's fiercely intelligent and driven by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of time travel.
* Jerome has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.
* Despite his eccentricities, he has a deep empathy for others and is always willing to lend a helping hand (or mind) to those in need.

**Interests:**

* Time travel and experimentation
* Art and music
* Ancient history and cultures
* Science and technology
* Philosophy and theoretical physics

Jerome Kazuo's passions are centered around understanding the fundamental nature of time itself. He spends his free time tinkering with new inventions, studying ancient civilizations, and exploring the boundaries of human knowledge.

As an artist, Jerome expresses himself through a combination of painting, writing, and music. His creative outlet helps him process the complexities of time travel and channel his energy into something meaningful.

When not pursuing his scientific endeavors, Jerome can often be found attending concerts, visiting museums, or engaging in lively debates with fellow intellectuals. His eclectic interests and infectious enthusiasm make him a compelling companion on any adventure through time.
