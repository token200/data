**Personality:**

Jerome is a determined and intelligent individual with a passion for botany that borders on obsession.

However, this fa√ßade hides a driven and curious person who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about her father's research. Jerome is intensely focused when she sets her mind on a project, but she can also be introspective and quiet, often lost in thought as she studies the intricate patterns of the plants in her greenhouse.

Jerome's primary interest lies in botany, particularly the study of rare and exotic plant species. She is an accomplished botanical artist, using her precise drawings to capture the beauty and complexity of these organisms. Her work has earned international recognition, but she continues to push the boundaries of her craft by conducting her own experiments and research.

Outside of her greenhouse, Jerome's interests include:

* Studying her father's research and uncovering the truth about his disappearance
* Exploring the scientific implications of harnessing plant power for energy production
* Reading literature on botany, history, and philosophy to broaden her understanding of the world around her
* Spending quiet evenings in contemplation, surrounded by the sounds and scents of her greenhouse
