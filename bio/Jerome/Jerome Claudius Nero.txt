**Physical Attributes:** Jerome Claudius Nero stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, framing his angular features and intense eyes â€“ a deep shade of indigo that seems almost purple in the right light. His nose is slightly pointed, giving him a subtle air of elegance.

**Interests:** Nero's artistic pursuits take up the majority of his time and energy, with painting being his primary focus. He has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and inspiration, often pouring over art history texts, philosophy, and psychology to fuel his creative process. In addition to art, he is deeply interested in mysticism, spirituality, and the nature of reality.

**Additional Traits:** Nero's upbringing, having grown up in a family of modest means with a rich creative heritage, has instilled in him a strong sense of resilience and determination. His parents' encouragement and support played a significant role in shaping his passion for art, and he remains fiercely protective of his artistic integrity as a result.

**Habits:** Nero's studio is cluttered and chaotic, reflecting his haphazard creative process. He often works long hours without interruption, fueled by coffee and an insatiable hunger for new ideas and experiences. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a deep connection with those who share his values, including Sarah, his biggest supporter.

**Quirks:** Nero's artistic output is characterized by an otherworldly energy, as evident in his vibrant colors and distorted shapes in "Echoes in the Attic." He has a tendency to become completely absorbed in his work, losing track of time as he pours his emotions onto the canvas.
