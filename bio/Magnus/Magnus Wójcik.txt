**Personality:** Magnus appears to be an enthusiastic and curious individual with a passion for anthropology. He is clearly fascinated by the art of guerilla performance and its connection to urban culture. His love for studying human behavior and self-expression makes him an engaging conversationalist.

**Interests:** As stated in the narrative, Magnus is focused on studying guerilla performance as his area of research. He's particularly interested in understanding how this art form reflects urban values and rhythms. His enthusiasm for street performers and their creative methods also suggests that he has a strong appreciation for music, dance, and other forms of self-expression.

* Background: He appears to have an interest in urban anthropology and may come from a background that involves arts or cultural studies.
* Style: His bright yellow raincoat in the story suggests that he might have a bold and eclectic sense of style, but more about this is not revealed.
