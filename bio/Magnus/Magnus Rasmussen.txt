**Personality:** Magnus is a complex and introspective person with a dry sense of humor. As a renowned neurosurgeon, he has developed a strong focus on his work, which can sometimes make him appear aloof or detached from the world around him. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep-seated emotional life, marked by nostalgia, regret, and a longing for human connection.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Light Brown, often neatly trimmed
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of intense physical training

**Interests:** Magnus is an avid chess player, having spent many hours playing with his grandmother as a child. He finds the game to be mentally stimulating and meditative, often using it as a way to clear his mind and focus on problems outside of surgery.

In addition to chess, Magnus has a deep love for exploration and discovery, particularly when it comes to the city he grew up in. He enjoys wandering through Copenhagen's streets, taking in its gray-hued beauty, and searching for hidden gems that few tourists notice.

Magnus is also an accomplished painter, having dabbled in art throughout his life. His paintings often feature dreamlike landscapes of the Danish countryside, which evoke a sense of serenity and calm.

Despite his many interests, Magnus's true passion lies with helping others and making a difference in people's lives through his work as a neurosurgeon.
