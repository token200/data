Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Magnus Korolev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Magnus Korolev is a master thief known for his cool detachment and aloofness. He has learned to rely solely on himself due to his difficult childhood experiences on the streets of Moscow. This self-reliance allows him to maintain a mask of emotional control, making it challenging for others to gauge his true feelings or form attachments with him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Magnus stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, allowing him to blend into crowded areas and navigate through spaces with ease.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a piercing blue, almost icy in intensity, which seems to bore into those he encounters. This color adds to his enigmatic presence and reinforces his ability to remain detached.

**Interests:** Magnus's life revolves around mastering the art of thievery, staying one step ahead of law enforcement, and perpetuating his legend as "The Shadow." He is intensely focused on maintaining secrecy and security in all aspects of his life. In his downtime, he appears to be deeply interested in understanding those who hired him for various jobs, trying to unravel clues that could reveal their identities.

While his professional life is consumed by the thrill of the chase and the art of deception, Magnus's personal life seems to be driven by an undercurrent of loneliness and a constant need to reassess his position within the shadows.
