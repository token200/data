Despite this, he has a natural charisma that draws people to him, especially those who are struggling or marginalized. He is intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and come up with creative solutions to problems. Magnus also has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means going against the status quo.
