**Personality:** Janek appears to be empathetic, compassionate, and driven by a desire to make a positive impact. He has a strong sense of social justice, which motivates him to challenge the bureaucratic red tape he encounters in his work as a caseworker. His encounter with Mme. Rousseau sparks a fire within him, revealing a determination to prioritize human connections over statistics.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Warm, earthy brown eyes that seem to hold a deep understanding and kindness

It is not explicitly mentioned in the story what Janek's hair color or texture are so I can only guess these details.
