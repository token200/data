Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Janek Liepiņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Janek Liepiņš is described as having a "slender frame," indicating that he is likely lean and agile. Unfortunately, his height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will assume that he is around 5'8" to 6'0" (173 cm to 183 cm) tall, which is a typical height range for a European male.

**Eye Color:**
Janek's eye color is not specified in the story, but given his Eastern European heritage (specifically, Latvian), I would imagine him having dark brown or blue eyes. Let's assume that he has piercing blue eyes, which seem fitting for a suave and cunning con artist.

**Personality:**
Janek appears to be a skilled and confident thief who is well-versed in the art of deception. He seems to possess a calm and calculated demeanor, even when faced with unexpected obstacles or surprises (such as the owner's early return). His ability to think on his feet and adapt to changing circumstances suggests that he is intelligent, resourceful, and calculating.

**Interests:**
As a skilled thief and con artist, Janek likely has an interest in gathering valuable items and rare artifacts. He seems to take great pleasure in outsmarting his targets and leaving them with a sense of awe and frustration. Additionally, his ability to navigate the shadows and move unseen suggests that he may have a fascination with stealth, espionage, or other clandestine pursuits.

**Additional Details:**
While not explicitly stated in the story, I would imagine Janek to be in his mid-to-late 30s, which is an age at which many con artists and thieves reach their peak of experience and expertise. His background as a skilled thief who has honed his craft on the streets of Riga suggests that he may have a rougher edge or a more troubled past, which could inform his personality and motivations.
