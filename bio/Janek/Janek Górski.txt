Here's a summary of Janek GÃ³rski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Janek is a introspective and thoughtful individual who has been shaped by his experiences. He's haunted by memories of his parents' tragic accident, but he's also determined to move forward with a newfound sense of purpose. He's compassionate, empathetic, and values his relationships with others deeply. There's an air of quiet resilience about him, and he seems to be driven by a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to understand himself and the world around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Janek is likely in his mid-to-late twenties or early thirties, but the exact age isn't specified. He has:

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - tall enough to stand out in a crowd, but not imposing.
* Eye Color: Blue - a bright, piercing blue that suggests a sharp intellect and a deep connection to the natural world.

**Interests:** Janek appears to be interested in exploring his own identity and sense of purpose. He's been traveling, chasing "the ghosts of his past," which suggests that he's drawn to history, culture, and personal growth. He also values his relationships with others, particularly those from his hometown of Gdynia. He seems to be someone who appreciates the beauty of nature (as evidenced by his love of pierogi and waterfront strolls) and is connected to the rhythms of the sea.

It's worth noting that Janek's interests are not fully specified in the original story, but based on the context and character traits presented, these seem like plausible assumptions.
