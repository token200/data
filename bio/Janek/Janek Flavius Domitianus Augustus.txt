Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Janek Flavius Domitianus Augustus:

**Personality:** Emperor Janek Flavius Domitianus Augustus appears to be a complex individual with conflicting traits. On one hand, he is described as a "just ruler" who is beloved by his people, suggesting that he has a compassionate and fair side. However, the whispers among palace staff imply that he may also be reckless, disregarding the concerns of others, and prioritizing his own interests over those of the state. This duality suggests that Janek is a multifaceted individual with both noble and self-serving tendencies.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no explicit descriptions of Janek's physical attributes in the short story. However, based on historical precedents (Domitian was a Roman Emperor known for his tyranny), we can make an educated guess:

* Height: Janek is likely around 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet tall, which was above average height for men during the ancient Roman Empire.
* Eye Color: Given the Mediterranean ancestry of the Romans, it's possible that Janek has blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** The short story reveals several interests and passions of Janek Flavius Domitianus Augustus:

* **Stargazing**: Janek is fascinated by the stars and believes that studying their movements can unlock the secrets of the universe.
* **Magic and Science**: He has a deep interest in ancient texts on magic and science, suggesting a curious and analytical mind.
* **Empathy**: Despite his imperious nature, Janek appears to have an empathetic side, willing to walk among his subjects at night to listen to their troubles and offer words of wisdom.

Keep in mind that these traits are speculative based on the short story, and there may be more to Janek's personality and interests than what is revealed here.
