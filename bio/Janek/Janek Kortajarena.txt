Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Janek Kortajarena:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Age: 32
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Warm, dark brown eyes with hints of golden undertones
- Hair: Jet-black, medium-length hair that's often neatly trimmed

**Personality:**
Janek is a introspective and compassionate person who has always been close to his family. He values tradition, community, and hard work, which stems from his upbringing in Puerto Rico. Despite his success in finance, he feels unfulfilled and disconnected from his roots. He's haunted by feelings of responsibility towards his parents and the farm, driving him to return home.

Janek is a natural caregiver and has a strong sense of empathy. His years spent living abroad have made him more aware of his own emotions and those around him. However, he still grapples with self-doubt and uncertainty about his future. Abuela MÃ³nica's presence brings stability and support to Janek, helping him confront his fears and find direction.

**Interests:**
Janek has always been passionate about preserving traditional farming practices and reconnecting with his family's history. He's eager to learn more about the hurricane that devastated their farm and find innovative ways to rebuild and revitalize it.

When at home, Janek enjoys exploring the surrounding hills, watching sunsets over the ocean, and engaging in lively discussions with his abuela about politics, literature, or music. He also finds solace in cooking traditional Puerto Rican dishes and experimenting with new recipes using fresh ingredients from their farm.

Despite feeling uncertain about his place in the world, Janek is driven by a desire to contribute positively to his community and leave a lasting impact on his family's legacy.
