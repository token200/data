His friends and family describe him as passionate, energetic, and slightly eccentric.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the short story, Janek's primary interest is aviation. He spends most of his free time working on planes, experimenting with new designs and techniques. When not tinkerering in his workshop, he enjoys flying (of course!), watching planes soar overhead, and reading about aircraft history.
