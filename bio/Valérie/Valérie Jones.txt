Her passion and conviction are contagious, inspiring those around her to take action.

**Physical Attributes:** Valérie stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purple, and seem to sparkle with intensity when she's speaking about something she cares deeply about. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, a memento from her early days as a writer.

**Interests:** Valérie is an avid writer and poet, and her creative expression is an essential part of her identity. She loves to explore the world through words, weaving stories that reflect her experiences and observations.

As a writer, Valérie draws inspiration from the world around her – people, experiences, and social injustices that fuel her passion to create change. Her love of words is matched only by her love of Marcus, with whom she shares a bond that has transformed her life in profound ways.
