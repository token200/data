Here is a summary of the fictional character Valérie Young:

Physical Attributes: Valérie stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with striking features. Her eyes are an arresting shade of piercing green, a trait that often goes unnoticed by those who know her as "Val". She has long, raven-black hair and porcelain-like skin.

Personality: Beneath her unassuming facade as an office worker, Valérie is a highly intelligent and resourceful individual with a sharp mind for strategy. Her persona in the world of high-stakes thievery reveals a bold, fearless, and cunning personality who thrives under pressure. However, this façade also conceals a deep-seated vulnerability and insecurity that Val tries to keep hidden from others.

Interests: In her free time (or rather, non-existent one), Valérie enjoys staying active, particularly in the realm of martial arts and parkour. She is highly skilled in these disciplines, which serve as an essential skillset for her nocturnal exploits. Additionally, she has a keen interest in art history and rare collectibles, perhaps influencing her choices when it comes to the artifacts she targets.

Her affinity for stealth and deception allows Valérie to excel at navigating both office politics and the dark underbelly of Los Angeles' underworld.
