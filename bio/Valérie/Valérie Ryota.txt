Here's a summary of the fictional character Valérie Ryota:

**Physical Attributes:** Valérie is a woman with an athletic build, likely due to her active lifestyle as a freelance journalist. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall and has piercing green eyes that seem to hold secrets and stories of their own. Her hair is dark brown, often pulled back into a ponytail or a loose bun, and she has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist.

**Personality:** Valérie is a tenacious and fearless investigator with a passion for uncovering the truth. She has a strong sense of curiosity and determination, which drives her to take on cases that others might deem too difficult or unorthodox. Her experience as a journalist has honed her skills in research, analysis, and interviewing, making her a formidable opponent when it comes to unraveling mysteries. Despite her tough exterior, Valérie has a compassionate side and is drawn to stories that highlight the struggles of ordinary people.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Valérie's interests lie in investigative journalism, history, and folklore. She is particularly fascinated by true crime cases and the supernatural, which often serve as inspiration for her work. In her free time, she enjoys reading classic literature, practicing yoga, and exploring abandoned places (which has led to some of her most intriguing assignments). Valérie's nomadic lifestyle has also given her a love for travel and meeting new people from different cultures.

**Background:** Little is known about Valérie's past, but it is clear that she has a mysterious and troubled history. She has been on the move for years, never staying in one place for too long, which suggests that she may be running from something or someone. Her reputation as a fearless investigator has earned her many enemies, making her case work increasingly complex and personal.
