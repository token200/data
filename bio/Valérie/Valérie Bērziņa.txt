Based on the provided story, here's a summary of Valérie Bērziņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Valérie is described as ambitious, determined, and fearless. She is not afraid to confront those in power, even when it puts her own career at risk. Her sharp instincts and dogged determination have earned her a reputation as one of the top young journalists in Latvia.

**Physical Attributes:**

Unfortunately, there is no information provided about Valérie's physical attributes other than her eye color. I've made an educated guess that she has blue eyes based on the Eastern European background mentioned in the story.

Her passion for journalism drives her to take risks and push boundaries, often putting her career at risk. Outside of work, there is no mention of Valérie's personal interests or hobbies.
