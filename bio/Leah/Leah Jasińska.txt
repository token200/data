Her features are delicate yet expressive, giving her an ethereal quality that belies her artistic intensity.

**Personality:**
Leah is a creative soul with a passion for art that borders on obsession. She is deeply introspective and emotional, often losing herself in the world of color and light as she works on her latest piece. Despite her reclusive tendencies, Leah has a strong sense of empathy and understanding, which allows her to capture the essence of those she draws with remarkable accuracy.

She spends most of her days lost in her studio apartment, surrounded by canvases, paints, and an endless supply of reference materials. Her love for drawing people is rivalled only by her love for capturing the natural world – she finds inspiration in the intricate patterns of leaves, the way light filters through trees, or the gentle curves of a river. When not working on her art, Leah can often be found reading about philosophy, psychology, or spirituality, which fuels her creative expression and helps her tap into her inner world.
