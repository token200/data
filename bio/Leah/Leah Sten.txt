Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Leah Sten:

**Personality:** Leah is a brilliant and reclusive astrophysicist who has dedicated her life to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Despite her exceptional mind and success in the scientific community, she remains a loner, preferring the company of books and star charts to people. However, this recent celestial event has marked a turning point for Leah, allowing her to realize that there's more to life than isolation.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height:** 5'6" (168 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Deep blue, with a hint of grey around the edges

**Interests:**

* Astrophysics and cosmology
* Developing new propulsion systems, particularly those related to dark matter
* Reading and collecting dusty tomes on various scientific subjects
* Stargazing and astronomical observations
* Coding and programming (especially for her top-secret project "Elysium")

As a person of intellect and science, Leah's interests focus primarily on advancing human understanding in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. Her isolation has led to an overemphasis on these areas, but the recent experience at the observatory has given her a new perspective on how social interactions can enhance her pursuit of knowledge.
