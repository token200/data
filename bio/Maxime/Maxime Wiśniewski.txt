**Personality:** Maxime is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who is somewhat enigmatic. He prefers solitude over social interactions, which suggests that he values his alone time above all else. Despite his intellectual brilliance, he comes across as skeptical and even gruff to those who don't know him, which may be a defense mechanism to protect himself from the outside world.

**Physical Attributes:** Maxime is likely in his mid-to-late 50s, given that Sophia meets him at a small café, where she imagines someone around her age would typically sit. He stands around 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His hair is probably graying and unkempt, reflecting his focus on his work over personal grooming.

**Interests:** Maxime's primary interest is mathematics, particularly fractals. He has spent most of his life studying these geometric shapes and has made groundbreaking discoveries in the field. He is obsessed with understanding the intricate patterns and self-similarity of fractals, which drives his research and fuels his curiosity. His work on fractals has garnered attention from the scientific community, but it's clear that he is driven by a passion for discovery rather than fame or recognition.

**Additional Insights:** Given Maxime's reclusive nature, it's likely that he values independence and freedom above all else. He may have few close relationships or social connections outside of his work, which could contribute to his skeptical demeanor towards others. Despite this, there is something captivating about him, as evident in Sophia's enthusiasm for meeting him and discussing her thesis.
