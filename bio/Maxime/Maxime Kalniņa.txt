Based on the story about Roberts Kalniņš, I've created a fictional character profile for Maxime Kalniņa:

**Physical Attributes:**
Maxime Kalniņa is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown, reminiscent of the rich soil found in Latvia's countryside. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, as if he's always just rolled out of bed. Max has a strong jawline and piercing eyebrows that seem to hold a perpetual question mark, hinting at his curious nature.

**Personality:**
Maxime Kalniņa is a free-spirited individual with a passion for storytelling and music. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect and support them. Max has a mischievous sense of humor, often using wit and charm to diffuse tense situations. His creative energy is contagious, inspiring those around him to tap into their own imagination and creativity.

**Interests:**
Maxime Kalniņa is an avid reader, devouring books on history, folklore, and mythology from all over the world. He is also a skilled musician, with a deep appreciation for the sounds of traditional Latvian instruments like the balss (a wooden flute) and the krītuva (a type of fiddle). Max loves exploring the city's hidden corners, discovering street performers, markets, and secret gardens that hold secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered. When not creating music or reading, Max enjoys experimenting with local cuisine, sampling traditional dishes like aukstā kāpostu zupa (cold soup) and rupjmaize (rye bread).

**Additional Details:**
Maxime Kalniņa's grandfather, a skilled violin maker, passed down his instrument to him when he was just a child. Max has inherited not only the violin but also his grandfather's love of storytelling and music. He often incorporates old family tales into his performances, weaving them into the fabric of his compositions.
