**Personality:** Maxime is a calculating and intelligent individual with a dry sense of humor. As a master thief, he is confident in his abilities and has a knack for staying one step ahead of his targets. Despite his reputation as "Le Fleur," the mask of anonymity allows him to remain unassuming and detached from the world around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Maxime stands at 6'1" with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is always perfectly styled, and his chiseled features give him an air of sophistication. He has a lean build, honed from years of physical training and agility exercises necessary for his line of work.

**Interests:** Maxime is a connoisseur of art and history, with a particular fondness for the works of Monet and other Impressionist masters. He has a vast knowledge of the art world, acquired through years of research and observation. His interest in the auction world extends beyond mere financial gain; he seeks to understand the emotional value of art and the people who collect it.

Additionally, Maxime is an expert in surveillance, infiltration, and strategy, making him a formidable opponent for those trying to outsmart him. He has an ear for detail and can read body language with ease, allowing him to remain stealthy and elusive even in high-pressure situations.

Maxime's interest in the Parisian underworld and its art world connections suggests that he is well-versed in local politics, social hierarchies, and hidden networks of power brokers. This blend of technical expertise, art appreciation, and knowledge of human psychology makes him a force to be reckoned with in his pursuit of the perfect heist.
