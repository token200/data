Here is a summary of Maxime Roy's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Maxime appears to be a resourceful and skilled operative with experience in high-stakes heists and reconnaissance missions. He seems to possess a keen sense of awareness, often sensing that something is amiss or off-balance (as evidenced by his feeling of being watched). His ability to remain calm under pressure, as seen during the high-speed chase, suggests that he is also composed and calculated in critical situations.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are only a few details provided about Maxime's physical appearance. It can be assumed that:

* He has dark hair, although this is not explicitly stated.
* His eye color is unknown, as only his gaze is described.
* He is of average or above-average height, but an exact measurement is not given (likely due to the fact that he was driving a van during the mission).
* His physical build and appearance are not mentioned, leaving it unclear whether he is lean, muscular, or otherwise.

**Interests:** Based on the story, Maxime's interests appear to be centered around his work with the Lupin gang and their high-stakes heists. He seems to have a strong sense of loyalty and camaraderie with his fellow gang members (particularly LePÃ¨re), which suggests that his personal relationships and group dynamics are important to him.

It is also possible that Maxime has an interest in art, as the artifact they recovered was a priceless relic from the Renaissance era. His role in acquiring this valuable object implies that he may have some level of expertise or passion for art history, although more information would be needed to confirm this assumption.
