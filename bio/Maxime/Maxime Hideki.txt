Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Maxime Hideki:

**Physical Attributes:** Maxime is a French-Japanese hybrid with an unassuming height of 5'10" (178 cm). His eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost black, but with hints of green that seem to gleam in the right light. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in loose waves. He has a lean build, honed from years of exploring the city streets on foot.

**Personality:** Maxime is an enigmatic individual with an air of mystery surrounding him. His eyes hold a thousand secrets, and his smile can disarm even the most hardened individual. However, beneath this charming exterior lies a complex and introspective person. Maxime has always felt like an outsider, never quite fitting into either French or Japanese culture. This sense of disconnection fuels his passion for art and music.

**Interests:** Maxime's interests are deeply rooted in his cultural heritage. He is passionate about art, particularly visual arts and sculpture, which he discovered on a stroll through the winding streets of Montmartre as a child. Music is also an integral part of his life; he has been playing the guitar since childhood and weaves melodies that reflect the city's rhythmic heartbeat.

Maxime's love for travel and exploration drives him to seek out new experiences and connections. He finds himself drawn to eclectic and underground art scenes, where he can connect with like-minded individuals who share his passion for creative expression. When he finally found his true calling as a musician, Maxime became swept up in the energy of the scene, but as fame took hold, he struggled to maintain control over his artistic vision.

Despite this turmoil, Maxime remains deeply connected to his cultural roots and continues to explore the intersection of French and Japanese art forms. His interests also extend to philosophy, spirituality, and introspection, which fuel his creative process and help him navigate the complexities of fame and identity.
