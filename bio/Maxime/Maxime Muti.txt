Here is a summary of the fictional character Maxime Muti:

**Physical Attributes:** Maxime stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His piercing blue eyes seem to sparkle with mischief, and his dark hair is often messy and unkempt, as if he's just rolled out of bed. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rugged charm.

**Personality:** Maxime is a charismatic free spirit with a quick wit and a sharp tongue. Despite his rough exterior, he has a heart of gold and a deep sense of empathy for those in need. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to get what he wants. However, this rebellious streak also makes him intensely loyal to those he cares about.

**Interests:** As Le Fant√¥me, Maxime's interests are centered around using his powers to protect the innocent and fight against injustice. He is deeply passionate about uncovering hidden secrets and solving mysteries, often taking on cases that others deem too complicated or impossible to solve. In his free time, Maxime enjoys reading about history, philosophy, and mysticism, as well as practicing martial arts and juggling clubs (a hobby he picked up while performing on the streets of Paris). He is also an avid collector of rare artifacts and antiquities, often seeking out new treasures to add to his collection.
