**Interests:** Valeria's interests are largely centered around her work as an operative, although she appears to enjoy the thrill of outsmarting her enemies and staying one step ahead. She is also shown to have a witty sense of humor and seems to appreciate the finer things in life (such as whiskey). Her calm and collected demeanor suggests that she may be a bit of a introvert or a perfectionist, preferring to focus on her work rather than socializing.
