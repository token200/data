**Personality:** Siegbert Pētersons is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a heart of gold. He has a strong sense of justice and will fiercely defend those in need, especially the vulnerable and underprivileged. Despite his fearsome reputation as a skilled swordsman, he has a soft spot for strays and underdogs, which often puts him at odds with the city's elite. However, those who know him best understand that Siegbert is driven by a strong sense of compassion and a desire to protect others.

**Physical Attributes:** Siegbert Pētersons stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm) with a rugged, athletic build that reflects his years of intense training as a swordsman.
