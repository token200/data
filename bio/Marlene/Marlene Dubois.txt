**Physical Attributes:**
Marlene is likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. She has an unmentioned height, but considering her age and the description of the station and house, it's possible that she's petite to average height. Her eye color is not specified, but based on the emotional tone of the story, it might be a soft blue or green.

**Personality:**
Marlene appears to be introspective, nostalgic, and emotionally sensitive. She has experienced significant loss (her father's passing) and is struggling to find her place in the world. Despite this, she possesses resilience and determination, as evident from her desire to return to Ravenswood and rebuild her life. Marlene values tradition, family history, and personal connection with nature.

**Interests:**
Marlene enjoys spending time outdoors, particularly collecting wildflowers and watching sunsets over the hills. She is likely an avid listener, as hinted at by her father's listening nature. Her interests might also include reading (based on the mention of old books in the house), reflection, and exploring the history of her family and town.

Additionally, Marlene seems to be someone who values simplicity and familiarity. The comfort of revisiting childhood haunts and re-establishing connections with the past suggests that she cherishes routine and tradition. Her longing for peace and hope in the face of uncertainty also implies that she is a compassionate and empathetic person.
