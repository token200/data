**Interests:** Giovanni's interests are varied and eclectic, reflecting his dual identity. On the surface, he enjoys:

* Numbers and finance (his day job as an accountant)
* Strategic planning and puzzle-solving (to stay one step ahead of Rachel Kim)

However, beneath this façade lies a deeper passion for:

* Thievery and cat burglary
* Outsmarting adversaries and outwitting opponents
* Collecting rare and valuable items, particularly the diamond necklace he's been pursuing

Giovanni is also deeply fascinated by human psychology, often using his knowledge of people and their motivations to stay ahead of Rachel Kim. His interests are driven by a desire for excitement, challenge, and the thrill of the chase.
