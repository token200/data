Giovanni Krūmiņa is a 30-year-old Latvian architect with an athletic build. He stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) tall with short, dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes that seem to sparkle with creativity. His sharp jawline and small nose give him a strong, determined face.

**Personality:**
Giovanni is a passionate and driven individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support their passions and dreams. Despite his intensity, Giovanni has a gentle soul and can be incredibly empathetic when listening to others' stories. His quick wit and sharp humor often help break the ice in tense situations.

**Interests:**
Giovanni is an avid photographer and loves capturing the beauty of Latvian landscapes through his lens. He's also a skilled woodworker, with a deep appreciation for traditional craftsmanship. When he's not working on projects or spending time with loved ones, Giovanni enjoys practicing yoga to stay centered and focused.

**Background:**

His parents were both artists, and their creative energy rubbed off on young Giovanni, instilling in him a love for art, design, and storytelling.
