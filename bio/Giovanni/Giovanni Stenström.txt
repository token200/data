Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Giovanni Stenström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Giovanni appears to be a introspective and emotional individual. He has a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature, which draws him to people-watching in dimly lit spaces like the café. He is likely a creative person himself, given his fondness for inspiration and connection with others who share similar passions. His background of exile suggests he may be introspective or brooding at times, but also open to new experiences and connections.

**Physical Attributes:** Giovanni's physical appearance is not described in great detail, but based on the story, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Giovanni seems relatively slender and unassuming, which allows him to blend into the background while still observing those around him. He may be around 5'9" (175 cm) or slightly shorter.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly stated, but based on his introspective nature and appreciation for literature, it's possible he has piercing brown or hazel eyes that are often lost in thought.

**Interests:** Giovanni is clearly an artistic and literary person. He appreciates the work of others, particularly those who create art, music, or write poetry. His own creative pursuits likely lie in a similar vein, such as writing, painting, or photography. Exile has provided him with inspiration, and he seeks connection with others through shared interests. He is also drawn to places that spark his imagination, like Stockholm's harbor.

It is worth noting that Giovanni seems to be someone who values emotional depth and authenticity. His connection with the woman reading aloud at the café suggests a deep appreciation for the human experience and the power of words to evoke emotions.
