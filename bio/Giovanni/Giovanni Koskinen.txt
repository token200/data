Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Giovanni Koskinen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Giovanni Koskinen stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that gives him a slightly rumpled appearance. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with intensity when he's talking about something he's passionate about.

**Personality:**
Giovanni is a complex individual with a strong sense of drive and determination. He is deeply passionate about botany, particularly orchids, and will stop at nothing to uncover new species. This single-minded focus often leads him to neglect his personal relationships and put all his energy into his work. Despite this, he has a good heart and is not inherently malicious; however, his tendency to prioritize his research over others can sometimes make him come across as aloof or standoffish.

**Interests:**
Giovanni's primary interest is botany, specifically orchids. He is an expert in the field of rare orchid species and spends most of his time searching for new and elusive varieties. His love for botany is matched only by his desire to explore the natural world and uncover its secrets.

As a scientist, Giovanni is fascinated by the intricacies of plant biology and the ways in which different species adapt to their environments. He is particularly drawn to the Amazon rainforest, where he spent many years searching for the Golden Lily.

Outside of botany, Giovanni seems to have few interests or hobbies beyond his research. His colleagues at the university often joke that he has a "second self" that only comes out when he's in his laboratory, surrounded by plants and equipment.
