Here's a summary of Oskar Palmas' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oskar is a introspective and creative person, with a deep-seated desire to understand his past and reconnect with his estranged sister. He has a strong sense of hope and longing, which drives him to hold onto the possibility that Anna is still out there for him. Despite his introspection, he appears to be observant and perceptive, able to pick up on subtle cues from others (as evidenced by Madame Dupont's understanding gaze).

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Oskar is an artist, specializing in charcoal drawings. He has a passion for art that stems from his childhood idolization of his sister Anna, who was also an artist. He finds solace and inspiration in his work, often losing himself in the process of creating. Additionally, Oskar seems to have a deep fascination with Parisian culture and history, as evidenced by his love for the city's artistic heritage.

Madame Dupont describes Oskar's art as "raw, honest - it speaks of pain but also hope." This suggests that Oskar is an emotionally expressive person who channels his emotions into his work, often resulting in powerful and evocative pieces.
