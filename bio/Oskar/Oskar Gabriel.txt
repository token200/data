Here's a summary of Oskar Gabriel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oskar is a curious and determined individual who is drawn to the darker corners of Berlin. He is a freelance writer and journalist with a passion for uncovering hidden truths and secrets. However, his fascination with the shadows has also made him introverted and sometimes distant from those around him. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to his friends, particularly Lena, and values their trust and support.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark blue
* Hair Color: Messy brown hair that often falls across his forehead
* Scarf: Bright orange scarf wrapped tightly around his neck to keep warm in the cold winter air

**Interests:** Oskar is deeply interested in history, particularly Berlin's rich and complex past. He loves to explore the city's hidden corners and uncover secrets that have been lost to time. As a journalist, he is driven by a desire to tell stories that need to be told, even if it means delving into the darker aspects of human nature. His investigation into secret societies and ancient rituals is just one example of his passion for uncovering the truth.

In addition to his work as a writer and journalist, Oskar enjoys spending time in nature, particularly when it's cold outside (he seems to thrive in winter conditions). He also values solitude and often finds himself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries he is trying to unravel.
