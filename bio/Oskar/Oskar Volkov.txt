Here is a summary of the fictional character Oskar Volkov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oskar Volkov appears to be a pragmatic and calculating individual, accustomed to navigating the complexities of Russia's elite oligarchy. He seems confident and charismatic, with a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by his wry smile when anticipating The Wolf's lateness. However, beneath this exterior, Oskar may have a more introspective side, driven by a desire for escape from the stifling bureaucracy of his childhood.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Skin Tone: Tanned and weathered, likely from spending time outdoors
- Hair: Dark brown and styled neatly, with a hint of sophistication

**Interests:** Oskar's interests appear to be focused on his business ventures, particularly his cutting-edge tech firm specializing in artificial intelligence. He is driven by a desire for success and financial security, but also seems to have an interest in understanding the world beyond Russia's borders. His experiences growing up in the Soviet Union may have instilled a sense of curiosity about the global world order, as hinted at by his pastime of reading propaganda posters.

It can be inferred that Oskar values intelligence, business acumen, and connections, as well as adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.
