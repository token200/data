Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Oskar Jing's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oskar Jing appears to be a introspective and melancholic individual, often lost in thought. Despite his experiences as a retired naval officer, he seems to carry a deep sense of nostalgia and longing for the past. However, as seen when he discovers his aunt's story, he also exhibits determination, resolve, and a desire to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original text does not provide detailed physical information about Oskar Jing. However, I can make some educated guesses based on his age, profession, and character traits:

- Height: Oskar likely stands around 5'10" (178 cm) to 6'2" (188 cm), typical height range for a retired naval officer who has had time to mature.
- Eye Color: His eyes are probably blue or grey, which would be consistent with his military background and introspective nature.

**Interests:** Oskar Jing's interests seem to revolve around the sea, sailing, and navigation. As a retired naval officer, he has an intimate connection with the water and likely finds solace in its tranquility. His interest in uncovering his aunt's story and exploring Venice's hidden corners also suggests that he values mystery, history, and self-discovery.

Additionally, Oskar seems to have a fascination with the city of Venice itself, which serves as a backdrop for much of his narrative. His interest in the city's secrets and hidden corners suggests that he is drawn to its rich history, architecture, and cultural heritage.

Please note that these are hypothetical assumptions based on the original story, and actual physical characteristics or interests may differ if Oskar Jing were further developed in other works.
