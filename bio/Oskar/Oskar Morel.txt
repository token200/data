Here is a summary of the fictional character Oskar Morel:

**Physical Attributes:** Oskar stands at an unassuming 5'9" (175 cm) with a lean and wiry build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are an intense, piercing green that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Oskar is enigmatic and introverted, preferring to let his art speak for itself rather than drawing attention to himself. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity, which he only reveals to those he trusts.

**Interests:** As an artist, Oskar is passionate about exploring themes of social justice and personal struggle through his paintings. He is deeply interested in the human condition and spends countless hours observing people, listening to their stories, and understanding their experiences. When not creating art, Oskar enjoys spending time outdoors, often taking long walks or sitting by a river to clear his mind.

Despite his creative pursuits, Oskar has a somewhat melancholic demeanor, as if he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. He is fiercely independent and values his solitude above all else. However, after meeting Sarah, he begins to reveal a more open and introspective side to himself, hinting at a deep desire to connect with others and share his message with the world.

**Quirks:** Oskar has a habit of carrying a small sketchbook with him wherever he goes, jotting down observations, ideas, and inspiration that strike him throughout the day. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and art history to fuel his creative process.
