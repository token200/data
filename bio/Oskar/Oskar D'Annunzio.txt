Based on the inspiration from Gabriele D'Annunzio, I created a fictional character profile for Oskar D'Annunzio:

Oskar D'Annunzio stands at 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often worn long, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with intensity when he speaks. He has a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him a strikingly handsome appearance.

He is quick-witted and sharp-tongued, able to think on his feet and navigate complex situations with ease. Oskar has a natural leadership quality that draws people to him, and he is not afraid to take risks or challenge authority.

**Interests:**
Oskar D'Annunzio is deeply passionate about literature, politics, and philosophy. He spends hours reading the works of Tolstoy, Nietzsche, and other great thinkers, seeking inspiration for his own writing and ideas. When he's not involved in politics or revolution, Oskar enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, often finding solace in nature's beauty and silence.

As a poet, Oskar D'Annunzio is drawn to the world of words and language, using his verse to express his emotions and ideas.
