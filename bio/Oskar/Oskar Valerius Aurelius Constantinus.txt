**Personality:** Oskar is portrayed as a deeply introspective and analytical individual consumed by the pursuit of knowledge. He is described as an "eccentric" in his youth, but this label eventually becomes a badge of honor as he uncovers revolutionary ideas. Throughout his life, he exudes quiet confidence and an air of mystery that inspires both awe and suspicion in those around him.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) - Oskar's height is not explicitly mentioned in the short story, but this estimate seems fitting for a man described as having a slender build.
  
- **Eye Color:** Dark Brown or Hazel - The text doesn't specifically state the eye color, but considering his analytical nature and introspective personality, brown eyes might seem more appropriate.

**Interests:**

1.  **Scholarly Pursuits**: Oskar is primarily focused on uncovering knowledge through reading ancient texts and conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory. His interests lie in the fields of anatomy, philosophy (especially Aristotle's works), and the pursuit of understanding human consciousness.
2.  **Celestial Alignments and Astrology**: As Oskar delves deeper into his research, he begins to notice patterns in celestial bodies that seem meaningful. He starts to study astrology and becomes fascinated with the connection between the universe and the human soul.
3.  **Philosophical Inquiry**: Beyond studying anatomy and understanding the workings of the mind, Oskar is driven by a desire to unravel philosophical mysteries, particularly those related to Aristotle's works.

These interests lead him on an epic journey that spans centuries, exploring the interconnectedness of all things in the universe and human consciousness.
