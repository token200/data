Based on the short story, here is a summary of Oskar Clarke's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oskar Clarke is a deeply passionate and intense individual, consumed by his art. He is driven by an insatiable desire for perfection and is willing to sacrifice comfort and convention in pursuit of it. Despite this intensity, he has a deep sadness and vulnerability that is hinted at throughout the story.

However, when fully immersed in his creative process, Oskar's passion becomes almost transcendent. He is able to tap into a raw power and energy that propels him forward. When not creating, Oskar appears to be somewhat introverted, possibly even standoffish or dismissive towards those who don't understand his art.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep indigo or violet eyes with a hint of gold around the iris
- Hair Color: Jet black hair often disheveled and unkempt from Oskar's intense creative sessions.
- Physical Build: Slender, lean build, likely due to his constant neglect for physical well-being in favor of artistic pursuits.

**Interests:** 

- Painting (specifically expressionist art)
- Exploring the realm of emotions and experiences through color, texture, and form
- Immersing himself in his creative process, losing track of time and reality.
- Researching techniques to further refine his craft.
- Experimenting with unconventional materials and methods in pursuit of artistic innovation.

Oskar's interests appear to be all-consuming and centered on the exploration of emotions through art. His intense focus on painting allows him to lose himself, find catharsis, and tap into a raw power that drives him forward.
