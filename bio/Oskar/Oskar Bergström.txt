**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown
- Hair Color: Light brown with subtle waves

**Personality:**
Oskar is a introspective person who has been feeling restless in his corporate job. He is drawn to art and music, often finding solace in the jazz club where he meets Lena and Marcus. Despite his reservations about taking risks, Oskar has a curious and adventurous spirit that longs for excitement beyond his mundane routine.

**Interests:**
Oskar's interests seem to revolve around creativity, self-discovery, and connection with others. He is inspired by the arts (specifically jazz music) and values meaningful relationships like the ones he shares with Lena and Marcus. Oskar appears to be fascinated by travel and the world beyond his familiar surroundings, having felt a pang of jealousy when he learns about Marcus's wanderlust lifestyle.

It's worth noting that while Oskar is inspired by others who have taken leaps of faith in their lives (Lena's travels), he himself has not yet made this move.
