Based on the inspiration from the short story about Augusto Fernández Borges, I've created a fictional character profile for Oskar Luis Borges:

**Name:** Oskar Luis Borges
**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Deep brown with hints of gold
**Hair Color:** Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt

**Personality:** Oskar is a introspective and imaginative individual, always lost in thought and exploring the depths of his own mind. He is fiercely independent and values his solitude, often finding solace in quiet nights spent writing or observing the world around him. Despite this, he has a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others, which drives him to create works that capture the complexity of human experience.

**Interests:** Oskar is passionate about literature, philosophy, and music, often finding inspiration in the works of existentialists, poets, and musicians who push the boundaries of human expression. He is also fascinated by the mysteries of time, space, and the human condition, which he explores through his writing and observations.

**Habits:** Oskar has a habit of scribbling notes and ideas in his journals whenever inspiration strikes, often using cryptic symbols and codes to conceal his thoughts from prying eyes. He is also known to wander aimlessly through cities and streets, observing people and places with an artist's eye.

**Strengths:** Oskar's unique perspective on the world, combined with his vivid imagination, allows him to craft stories that are both thought-provoking and mesmerizing. His writing is like a key that unlocks hidden doors in the reader's mind, revealing new insights and understanding of the human experience.

**Weaknesses:** Oskar's tendency to withdraw into himself can sometimes make it difficult for others to connect with him, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection. His obsessive nature also drives him to overwork and push himself too hard, potentially leading to burnout and creative stagnation.

This fictional character profile is inspired by the enigmatic figure of Augusto Fernández Borges, but has its own distinct personality and traits.
