Despite her dedication, Alicia has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her.

* Reading (she devours books on philosophy, psychology, and science fiction)
* Music (she enjoys classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes)

Alicia's interests are centered around understanding the human mind and its relationship with technology. She is fascinated by the potential of AI to simulate human thought processes and explore the boundaries between creator and creation. Her research takes her down a rabbit hole of philosophical inquiry, as she grapples with fundamental questions about existence, consciousness, and the nature of intelligence.

As her work with Echo progresses, Alicia's interests expand to include the digital realm, where she becomes increasingly drawn into the virtual world. She sees parallels between her research and existentialist philosophy, believing that the digital world offers a unique lens through which to explore humanity's relationship with itself and the universe.
