Here's a summary of Alicia Bjorkqvist's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alicia is a creative and introspective person who is not afraid to be herself. She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as slightly sarcastic or ironic at times, but this is often used to deflect from her true feelings. Despite her tough exterior, she has a vulnerable side that she only reveals to those close to her, like Emily. Alicia is also fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else.

**Physical Attributes:** Alicia stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often adorned with a few strategically-placed clips or pins to add a touch of whimsy to her outfits. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with mischief when she's talking about something she's passionate about.

**Interests:** Alicia is deeply passionate about music, particularly jazz and blues. She has a remarkable ear for melody and rhythm, often finding herself lost in the sounds and vibrations of her favorite tunes. Music is not just a hobby for her, but an integral part of her being, providing solace, inspiration, and a sense of connection to others who share her interests. Alicia also enjoys long walks in nature, reading, and trying new foods - especially when they're experimental or adventurous.

**Additional Quirks:** Alicia has a habit of collecting unusual trinkets and mementos from her travels, which she displays proudly on the walls of her home. She's also a bit of a night owl, often staying up late to write in her journal or work on creative projects that are just starting to take shape.
