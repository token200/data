Here is a summary of Alicia Kaminski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alicia is a sharp-witted and confident businesswoman with a tough exterior, but beneath her lies a heart of gold. She has a tendency to come across as intimidating or aloof to those who don't know her, but she is also fiercely loyal and protective of those she cares about. Her wit and sarcasm can be biting at times, but it's often used as a defense mechanism to hide her true feelings.

**Physical Attributes:** Alicia stands at 5'8" with long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to sparkle with amusement when she's talking about something she loves or is passionate about. She has a fit and toned physique from years of working out and maintaining an active lifestyle.

**Interests:** Alicia is an avid businesswoman and entrepreneur, always looking for new opportunities to invest in and grow her wealth. However, as the story suggests, there may be more to her than meets the eye. In terms of personal interests, Alicia enjoys fine wine, gourmet food, and travel (especially to exotic destinations). She's also a bit of a thrill-seeker and has a tendency to push herself physically and mentally.

**Other:** One notable detail about Alicia is that she had previously been burned in relationships, which may have contributed to her guarded approach to love. Despite this, there was something about Rachel that made her feel seen and understood in a way that few others ever have.
