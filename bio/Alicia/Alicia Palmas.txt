Based on the short story inspiration, here is a summary of Alicia Palmas' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alicia appears to be a complex and introspective individual. She is drawn to the darkness that surrounds Ravenswood, but at the same time, she feels repelled by it. This ambivalence suggests that she is torn between her desire to confront the truth about her family's past and her fear of being consumed by the same darkness. Her determination to uncover the truth about her father's actions implies that she is driven, possibly even fiercely independent.

**Physical Attributes:** Alicia is described as a young woman with an unnamed height. However, based on the description of Alessandro Palmas' presence in Ravenswood and his impact on those around him, it can be inferred that Alicia may have inherited her mother's physical resemblance to him. Her eye color is unknown, but given her father's dark past, it's possible that she has a similar or contrasting eye color.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Alicia is interested in:

* Uncovering the truth about her family's past and her father's actions
* Confronting the darkness that has haunted Ravenswood and her own family for so long
* Understanding the impact of her father's business tactics on those around him
* Possibly exploring the history of Ravenswood and its connection to Alessandro Palmas' empire

It is unclear what Alicia's personal interests or hobbies are, but it can be inferred that she is driven by a sense of purpose and a desire for knowledge about her family's past.
