Based on the short story, I have created a profile for Alicia Woźniak:

**Physical Attributes:**
Alicia is of average build and height, with a slender yet athletic physique. She stands at around 5'6" (168 cm) with a gentle curve to her waist. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost violet in color, which seem to hold a deep intensity and wisdom beyond her years.

**Personality:**
Alicia is a complex and introspective individual, with a rich inner life that is both deeply rooted in her experiences and quietly reflective. She possesses a strong sense of self-awareness, having spent time exploring the depths of her own soul, which has allowed her to navigate life's complexities with relative ease. Her return to her hometown suggests that she is searching for answers or seeking a deeper connection with herself.

**Interests:**
Alicia appears to be an artistic and introspective person, drawn to creative expression as a way to explore the mysteries of her own psyche. The description of the letter's cryptic message, which drew her back home, suggests that she is attuned to subtleties and nuances in language and symbolism. She might have a fascination with old traditions, folkways, and local legends, reflecting her connection to her hometown's history.

**Additional Insights:**
Alicia seems to possess an uncanny ability to connect with others, especially those who understand the complexities of human emotions and experiences. The warm welcome from Mrs. Kowalska, who seemed to sense Alicia's return, implies that she might be someone who naturally connects with people on a deep level.

**Background:**
While there is limited information about Alicia's past life, it appears that she left her hometown as a teenager, feeling stifled by the limitations and expectations of her surroundings. Her experiences at university and in her career have led to growth but also created a sense of disconnection from herself and her roots.
