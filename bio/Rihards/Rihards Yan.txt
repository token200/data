Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Rihards Yan's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Rihards Yan appears to be a driven and passionate individual who is deeply committed to his work. He is meticulous and thorough in his research, as evident from the complexity of equations on the blackboard. Despite his focus on the scientific aspects of his research, he also shows a lighter side when interacting with Maria, such as laughing together over a mistake.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Rihards Yan is likely around 5'10" to 6'2" (178 cm to 188 cm), given his stature and ability to stare down at the complex equations on the blackboard.
* Eye Color: His eye color is likely brown, as it complements his intellectual and introspective nature.

**Interests:** Rihards Yan's primary interest is physics, specifically quantum mechanics. He spends most of his time studying and researching this subject, seeking to unlock its secrets. In addition to his work, he seems to enjoy the company of others, particularly his graduate student Maria, whom he works closely with. He also appreciates a good cup of coffee, as evidenced by his gratitude for Maria's freshly brewed offering.

It is worth noting that Rihards Yan and Rihards Janavs are two different characters, so I've made some adjustments to the details provided in the original story to fit the fictional character "Rihards Yan".
