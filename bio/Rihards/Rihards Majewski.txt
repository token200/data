Here's a summary of the fictional character Rihards Majewski:

Physical Attributes: Rihards is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an average to lean build, which allows him to move freely between his laboratory equipment and experiments. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he looks at, a trait that can make others feel uneasy in social situations.

Personality: Rihards is a brilliant but reclusive scientist who has spent most of his life studying the mysteries of the universe. He's intensely focused on his work and has an unrelenting drive for discovery. This passion often borders on obsession, leading him to neglect his personal life and relationships. Despite his impressive credentials, he struggles with social interactions, preferring the company of machines to people.

Interests: Rihards' primary interest is the search for a stable wormhole, which he believes could revolutionize transportation and communication across vast distances. He's also deeply interested in theoretical physics, spending countless hours studying lines of code, tweaking and testing his experiments. In his free time (if he can be said to have any), Rihards likely spends hours poring over complex mathematical equations and reading scientific papers related to his field.

Additional details: It seems that Rihards grew up in the rural countryside of Latvia with parents who were both scientists themselves. This upbringing likely instilled in him a love for discovery and an interest in physics from a young age. His education took him to one of Europe's top universities, where he earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.

Given his reclusive nature, Rihards' social life is likely limited to occasional interactions with colleagues or mentors like Dr. Helena Anders, who seems to be his primary point of contact outside of his laboratory.
