Here is a summary of Rihards Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Rihards stands at 6'2" with a ruggedly muscular build, honed from years of professional wrestling. His short, dark hair is often messy, and his piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he looks at. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from one of his wrestling matches.

**Personality:** Rihards is a quiet and reserved individual who speaks little, but when he does, people listen. He exudes confidence and authority, earned from years of experience in the wrestling ring. Despite his tough exterior, Rihards has a soft spot for those in need and is fiercely loyal to those he cares about.

**Interests:** Rihards' passion for wrestling is undeniable, but outside of the ring, he is also an avid coach and mentor. He finds joy in helping young athletes like Sasha grow and develop their skills, both physically and mentally. When he's not coaching or mentoring, Rihards enjoys spending time with his close friends and family, sharing stories and laughter around the dinner table.

As a person who values hard work, discipline, and loyalty, Rihards is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect those he cares about. He will stop at nothing to defend Sasha's well-being and prove that his methods are superior to his rival gym owner's offers.
