Based on the inspiration from the short story about Yi-hsien, I'll create a fictional character profile for Rihards Yi-hsien. Since there's no existing information on him, I'll make up some details to flesh out his personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Name:** Rihards Yi-hsien (Note: The original story only mentioned "Yi-hsien" as a common name, so I've added a first name that complements the cultural background)

**Age:** Late 20s

**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)

**Eye Color:** Deep brown with golden flecks, characteristic of many East Asian cultures.

**Personality:** Rihards is a charismatic and resourceful individual who has earned respect from his community for his bravery, strategic thinking, and quick wit. He has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to defend the vulnerable or stand up against injustice. Despite his fearless demeanor, he has a compassionate side and values loyalty above all else.

**Physical Attributes:** Rihards stands at 5'10" with an athletic build, honed from years of martial arts training. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy, practical manner that allows for easy combing while on the move. He has a strong jawline and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Rihards is passionate about:

* Martial arts: He is an expert in traditional Hakka martial arts, particularly the use of the wooden cane as depicted in the original story.
* Investigation: Rihards enjoys solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries, often using his knowledge of local customs and folklore to uncover hidden clues.
* Storytelling: He is a skilled oral storyteller, able to weave intricate tales that captivate audiences with their blend of history, mythology, and entertainment.

**Background:** Little is known about Rihards' past, but it's rumored that he grew up in the same Hakka community as the young merchant from the original story. Some speculate that he may be a member of a prominent local family or have a mysterious connection to the city's powerful elite.
