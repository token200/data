Here's a summary of Rihards Charrier's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:**
Rihards Charrier is a complex and intriguing character with a mysterious past. He exudes charm and charisma, making him a skilled operative who could easily hide behind his mask of confidence. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and a lingering desire for control. His instincts are sharp, and he's highly perceptive, often sensing danger before it arises. Despite his tranquil life in the countryside, Charrier is haunted by his past, and his emotions can shift from calm to intense rapidly.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** 6'1" (185 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Piercing blue, which seems almost icy in intensity
- **Other Physical Details:** Charrier has a lean build, honed from years of physical activity and high-stakes missions. His dark hair is flecked with gray, suggesting the weight of his years, but it still carries an air of ruggedness. His features are finely chiseled, as if carved by nature itself.

**Interests:**
Rihards Charrier's interests seem centered around espionage, his profession before retiring. He was deeply immersed in the world of spy craft and seems to have a passion for the thrill and challenge it provides. Outside of work, he enjoys his life in the French countryside, where he can relax on his vineyard veranda, surrounded by nature. This tranquility offers him respite from the high-stakes world he left behind, but also serves as a reminder that even amidst peace, danger is always lurking.

Given the sparse information about Charrier's interests outside of espionage and spy craft, it can be inferred that he enjoys solitude, reflection, and perhaps some intellectual pursuits, possibly related to history or geopolitics. However, his past suggests that these interests are somewhat secondary to his life as a spy, and he might have lost touch with many aspects of his former life.

Charrier's love for fine wine, as hinted at by his enjoyment of Bordeaux on the veranda, could also suggest an appreciation for finer things in life.
