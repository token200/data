Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Rihards Khan:

**Personality:** Rihards Khan is a complex and enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery. He exudes an aura of power and menace, commanding respect and fear from those who know his reputation. Despite his formidable presence, he seems to have a dry sense of humor and may be intrigued by the notion of being understood or manipulated by others. However, beneath this surface-level confidence lies a deep-seated desire for control and recognition, stemming from his humble beginnings as Mikhail.

**Physical Attributes:** Rihards Khan stands at an imposing 6'5" (196 cm), with a tall, lean build that suggests strength and agility. His dark hair is often slicked back, revealing piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His chiseled features are accentuated by a sharp jawline, prominent cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (likely from a childhood injury). He has a distinctive air of quiet authority about him, as if he is always watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

**Interests:** Rihards Khan's interests lie in manipulating events from behind the scenes, using his magical abilities to influence key players and shape outcomes to his advantage. He is drawn to high-stakes gambles and games of cat-and-mouse with powerful adversaries, where he can test his skills and expand his network of loyal followers. On a personal level, he seems to be haunted by a sense of abandonment and disconnection from his past self, as if Mikhail's transformation into Rihards Khan has left him feeling like an outsider among those who once knew him.

As the years went by, whispers began to circulate about Rihards Khan's true intentions - that he was slowly building an army of loyal followers, gathering strength for a final, apocalyptic showdown. His ultimate goal remains unclear, but it is evident that Rihards Khan will stop at nothing to achieve his vision of total domination over all.
