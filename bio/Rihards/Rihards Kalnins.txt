Here's a summary of Rihards Kalnins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Rihards stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His eyes are an intense, piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face. He has a sharp jawline and high cheekbones, giving him a chiseled appearance.

**Personality:** Rihards is a driven and ambitious individual, fiercely determined to uncover the truth. His passion for journalism is matched only by his curiosity about human nature's darker aspects. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries in pursuit of a story. This has earned him both respect and skepticism from his colleagues, who see him as a rising star but also question his motivations.

**Interests:** Rihards is fascinated by true crime stories, historical conspiracies, and the complexities of human psychology. He spends his free time reading about infamous cases, attending lectures on forensic science, and interviewing experts in various fields. He's particularly drawn to the darker corners of history, where occupation, resistance, and survival tales can reveal a wealth of information about the human condition.

Despite his growing obsession with the conspiracy he's investigating, Rihards remains curious about the world around him. He's an avid listener, always looking for new perspectives and insights that might shed light on his story. His intensity and focus often lead to long hours spent researching, interviewing, and writing, but it's clear that this drive will propel him to uncover secrets he never thought possible.

It's worth noting that the mysterious phone call and encounter with a figure claiming to be himself raises questions about Rihards' own identity, motivations, and the true nature of his investigation. As the story unfolds, it's unclear whether Rihards is a mastermind or just caught up in a web of intrigue, but one thing is certain: he's on a collision course with something that will change him forever.
