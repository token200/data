**Interests:** Jacques' primary interests are music (as the lead singer of The Discordant Notes), art (he recently discovered an appreciation for experimental sculptures), and animal welfare (specifically stray cats like Whiskers). He values his creative freedom above all else, often taking risks in both his artistic pursuits and personal life.
