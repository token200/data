* Nero has a habit of tapping his pen on his desk when deep in thought or analyzing clues.
* He's often seen carrying a worn leather notebook and pencil to jot down observations and ideas as they strike him.
* Despite his exceptional analytical mind, Nero has been known to experience "mind blindness" – where he momentarily forgets important details about a case – which can be infuriating but also serves as an impromptu reminder to think outside the box.
