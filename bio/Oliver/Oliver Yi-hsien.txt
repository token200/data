Here's a summary of the fictional character Oliver Yi-hsien:

Physical Attributes:
- Age: Late 30s to early 40s
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green, often described as an intense, almost unnerving gaze

Personality:
Oliver is a man of mystery with an air of enigma that commands respect and intrigue. He is fiercely intelligent, possessing an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. This sharp mind is complemented by his quick wit and confident demeanor, making him a formidable detective. However, few know about the troubled past that lies beneath his polished exterior.

Interests:
Oliver's interests are largely centered around his work as a detective, using his exceptional skills to unravel complex mysteries and bring justice to those who have been wronged. Outside of his professional life, little is known about Oliver's personal hobbies or passions. It can be inferred that he values independence and autonomy, given his history on the streets of Taipei, where he honed his survival skills as a pickpocket.

Despite this, Oliver's dedication to uncovering truth and fighting against corruption suggests a strong sense of justice and morality, which drives him to take on high-profile cases like Marcus's necklace theft. His insatiable thirst for knowledge may also hint at an underlying curiosity about the world around him, though it remains largely unexplored in public view.
