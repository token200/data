Here's a summary of Oliver Flavius Domitianus Augustus' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), which is slightly above average for an ancient Roman male.
- Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes, often described as cold and calculating, reflecting his ambition and ruthless nature.

**Personality:**

Oliver Flavius Domitianus Augustus is a complex figure, marked by both charisma and ruthlessness. He possesses a commanding presence, exuding confidence and authority that can be intimidating to those around him. Despite this, he also has a cunning and calculating side, always looking for ways to advance his own interests and solidify his grip on power.

**Interests:**

Oliver's primary interest is, of course, maintaining and expanding his empire through any means necessary. He is obsessed with securing the legacy and power that has been passed down to him from his father and predecessors. This obsession drives him to continually seek new sources of wealth and influence, often at the expense of others.

Outside of politics, little is known about Oliver's personal interests or hobbies. However, it can be inferred that he likely enjoys luxury and excess, as many emperors and nobles of ancient Rome did. He may also have a fascination with history and legacy, given his own fixation on cementing his place in the annals of time.

It is worth noting that Oliver's true nature – whether or not he was cursed or simply driven mad by power – remains somewhat ambiguous, adding another layer to this enigmatic figure's persona.
