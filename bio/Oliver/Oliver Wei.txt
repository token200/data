**Personality:** Oliver Wei is charismatic and confident, able to effortlessly charm his way out of situations. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, with exceptional hacking skills that make him a valuable asset to the top-secret government agency he works for. Despite his secret agent persona, he appears ordinary as an accountant by day, which allows him to blend in seamlessly with civilian life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel

**Interests:** Oliver Wei is a man of many interests and passions. In his free time, he enjoys playing chess and strategy games, as well as practicing martial arts to maintain his physical fitness. He is also an avid reader of fiction novels and philosophy books, often seeking out new perspectives on the world around him.

In terms of relationships, Oliver seems to have a close but mysterious bond with the woman who approaches him at Club Europa, whom we can assume will be referred to as "Alex" for this summary. Alex appears to have a personal connection to Oliver, and their interaction is laced with an undercurrent of trust and warning.

Oliver's interests in his secret agent life would likely revolve around maintaining his skills and staying one step ahead of his adversaries, while also uncovering the truth about the conspiracy that Alex reveals to him.
