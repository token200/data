Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Huang Baolian (Huang Bak):

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing emerald green
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp nose, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Personality:**
Huang Baolian is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a web of emotions. He's fiercely independent and driven by a desire for justice, having lost his family at a young age. This traumatic event has fueled his need for revenge against those who prey on the innocent. Despite his rough exterior, he possesses a sharp wit and quick thinking, making him a formidable opponent.

**Interests:**
- Riding horses, particularly his trusty steed
- marksmanship and shooting practice to hone his skills
- Reading and studying books about history, law, and philosophy to broaden his understanding of the world

Huang Baolian is also deeply curious about human nature and seeks to understand what drives people to become outlaws or heroes. He's fascinated by the gray areas in between, and this curiosity fuels his quest for justice.

It's worth noting that Huang Bak's interest in reading and studying suggests a more introspective side to his personality, which might be at odds with his tough exterior as an outlaw. This contrast adds depth to his character and makes him a more nuanced and intriguing figure.
