Based on the inspiration from the Chinese legend of Huang Pei (Peachtopia), I've created a short summary of the fictional character Huang Piątek:

Name: Huang Piątek

Personality: Huang Piątek is a free-spirited and adventurous individual with a deep connection to nature. He possesses a gentle yet unyielding spirit, always seeking balance and harmony in all aspects of his life. His curiosity and love for discovery drive him to explore the world, uncover hidden secrets, and learn from the wisdom of others.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Soft amber with golden undertones
- Hair Color: Dark brown with subtle hints of auburn

Interests:

* Huang Piątek is an avid botanist and naturalist, often venturing into the wilderness to study and protect rare plant species.
* He has a deep appreciation for traditional Chinese arts, including calligraphy, painting, and tea ceremony.
* As a passionate storyteller, he loves to share tales of his adventures and the lessons learned from ancient wisdom.
* Huang Piątek is also an accomplished musician, often playing the guqin (an ancient Chinese zither) to soothe the soul and bring people together.

Though not seeking immortality like Lin in the original story, Huang Piątek's spirit is driven by a desire for personal growth, understanding, and harmony with nature. His journey is one of self-discovery, where he uncovers the secrets of the natural world and shares them with others to promote balance and unity within himself and those around him.
