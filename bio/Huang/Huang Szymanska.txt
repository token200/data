I'd like to help you develop the character of Huang Zofia Szymanska. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Huang Zofia Szymanska stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her dark brown eyes are almond-shaped and fringed with thick eyelashes, adding to their allure. Her hair is a rich, chestnut brown color that falls in loose waves down her back.

**Personality:**
Zofia is a free-spirited individual with a passion for adventure and exploration. She's fiercely independent, always willing to challenge the status quo and take risks when necessary. This trait often gets her into trouble, but it also makes her incredibly resilient and resourceful. Zofia has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic at times, but beneath her tough exterior lies a heart of gold.

**Interests:**
Zofia's true love is archaeology, with a particular focus on uncovering hidden histories and lost cultures. She spends most of her free time reading about ancient civilizations, practicing martial arts, and studying languages. Her fascination with history drives her to travel the world, seeking out new discoveries and experiences that will help her better understand the past.

In terms of personal relationships, Zofia values authenticity and honesty above all else. She's fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and is always willing to lend a helping hand.
