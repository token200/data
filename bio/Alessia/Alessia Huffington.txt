Based on the character of Arianna Huffington from the provided story, I have created a fictional profile for Alessia Huffington:

Her eyes are an expressive shade of hazel, with golden flecks that sparkle when she smiles. She has a small tattoo of the Greek alphabet on her left wrist, symbolizing her cultural heritage.
