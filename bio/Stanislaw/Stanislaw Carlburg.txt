His dark brown hair is flecked with gray, and he often sports a well-groomed beard that adds to his air of intellectualism. Despite his refined appearance, Stanislaw often appears disheveled, with a rumpled suit and dusty boots that suggest he's been pouring over ancient texts for hours on end.

He is a perfectionist, driven by an insatiable curiosity and passion for knowledge that borders on obsession. His humility and unassuming nature make him appear approachable, but those who get close to him quickly realize that he is a force to be reckoned with - intelligent, analytical, and razor-sharp in his critique of others' work.

He spends most of his time poring over dusty old texts, analyzing documents, and conducting research on various historical periods.
