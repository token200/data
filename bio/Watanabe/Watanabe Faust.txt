Here's a summary of Watanabe Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Watanabe Faust is a complex character with a mix of traits. On one hand, he is ambitious, driven, and perfectionistic, which led him to make a deal that changed his life forever. However, as the story progresses, we see that he also has moments of vulnerability, melancholy, and introspection. He is haunted by the cost of his success and struggles with relationships due to his intense focus on his craft.

Despite this, Faust's encounter with the mysterious stranger and her visitations spark a transformation within him. He begins to see the world anew, valuing connection, art, and music over his original goals. This newfound perspective brings about a sense of purpose and fulfillment, allowing him to rediscover himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Watanabe Faust is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, which would be fitting for someone who plays the koto for extended periods.

His eye color is not specified in the original story, but based on the description of the old woman's piercing green eyes, it's possible that Faust's own eye color is a different shade, such as brown or hazel.

**Interests:** Faust's primary interest has always been playing the koto. He is an exceptional musician, and his passion for music drives him to constantly improve and master new skills. However, after meeting the mysterious stranger and undergoing a transformation, his interests expand to include:

* Connection: Faust begins to value relationships and human connections over his individual success.
* Art: He sees the world as a canvas waiting to be filled with art, music, and creativity.
* Music: His passion for playing the koto becomes more about expressing himself and sharing his gift with others, rather than just achieving perfection.

These new interests bring about a sense of purpose and fulfillment that he had been lacking before.
