When faced with uncertainty or adversity, he tends to be introspective and calculating, weighing the pros and cons before acting.

**Physical Attributes:** Harris is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, though exact age is not specified. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, which suggests a lean yet athletic build. His eye color is described as brown or dark, possibly hinting at Asian heritage given his surname.

**Interests:** Harris's interests appear to revolve around his work as an operative. As a seasoned intelligence officer, he likely has a strong interest in global politics, geopolitics, and military strategy. He may also have a fascination with the nature of power and control, particularly in high-stakes situations. Outside of work, his social life seems limited, suggesting that he may be focused on personal projects or solo endeavors.

Some possible interests or hobbies that might not be explicitly stated but could be inferred include:

- Reading about history, politics, or philosophy to maintain a broad perspective
- Engaging in physical activities like martial arts or running as a way to cope with stress
- Collecting whiskey bottles (he's already downed two) and other rare spirits as a personal indulgence
