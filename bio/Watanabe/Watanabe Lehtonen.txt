Here's a summary of Watanabe Lehtonen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Watanabe Lehtonen is a quiet and enigmatic individual who keeps to himself, preferring to observe rather than interact. He has a mysterious past, which makes it difficult for others to know him intimately. Despite his reserved nature, he appears to be intensely focused and determined, always on the lookout for potential threats or dangers.

**Physical Attributes:** Lehtonen is of average height, standing at around 5'9" (175 cm). His piercing green eyes seem to hold a deep intensity, as if they're constantly scanning his surroundings. He has an unkempt appearance, with dark hair and stubble that adds to his rugged demeanor.

**Interests:** It's unclear what Lehtonen's specific interests are, but it can be inferred that he values stealth, strategy, and survival skills. As a master of blending into his surroundings, he likely enjoys observing human behavior and studying the art of deception. He may also be drawn to puzzles, games of wit, or intellectual challenges that test his mental agility.

The fact that Lehtonen received a message about someone new in town suggests that he's deeply concerned about maintaining control over his environment and way of life. This concern, combined with his natural abilities as a thief and survivalist, implies that Lehtonen is driven by a strong sense of self-preservation and a desire to stay one step ahead of those who might pose a threat.

It's also possible that Lehtonen has a fascination with people-watching or studying human behavior, which would explain why he's so attentive to the caf√© patrons. The fact that he drops his guard momentarily when the woman sits across from him suggests that there may be more to this encounter than initially meets the eye...
