She is driven by her desire to understand the mysteries of the universe and has spent her entire career studying the subject.

However, she has a strong sense of loyalty to those she trusts, as evident in her relationship with Dr. Tanaka.

**Physical Attributes:**

It is worth noting that there are no details provided in the original short story about Meier's age, facial features, or any other physical attributes beyond height and eye color. I have filled in these gaps with general assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with brilliant scientists like Dr. Meier.
