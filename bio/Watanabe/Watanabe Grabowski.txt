**Physical Attributes:** Watanabe Grabowski stands at approximately 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with a rugged yet lean build. His eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue in hue, which seem to gleam with intensity when he's passionate about something. His dark hair is often unkempt and flecked with grey, giving him a distinguished air.

**Personality:** Grabowski has a tough exterior that hides a kind heart and a deep sense of justice. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Despite his rough demeanor, he has a dry wit and can be witty when the situation calls for it. His foreign accent and unfamiliar customs initially made him an outsider in Ashwood, but as people got to know him, they discovered a humble and hardworking individual who is always willing to lend a hand.

**Interests:** Grabowski's interests are centered around his passion for justice and loyalty. He has a natural talent for fixing broken objects and machinery, which led him to take on the task of repairing fences at the local farm. In his free time, he enjoys long walks in the countryside, watching the sunset over the rolling hills of Ashwood. His love for nature and the outdoors is a stark contrast to his turbulent past in Japan.
