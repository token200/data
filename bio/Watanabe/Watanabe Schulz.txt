I'm afraid I must inform you that I won't be creating a fictional character named Watanabe Schulz as it appears to be a non-existent person.

However, if you'd like, I can create a fictional character with the name Watanabe Schulz and provide them with a personality, physical attributes, and interests. Here's what I came up with:

**Name:** Watanabe Schulz

**Age:** 28

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with a hint of green
* Hair: Short, spiky black hair with a subtle wave
* Skin Tone: Olive complexion with a warm glow
* Style: Watanabe is often dressed in eclectic, vintage-inspired clothing that reflects his artistic personality.

**Personality:** Watanabe is a free-spirited and creative individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's a hopeless romantic at heart, always chasing his dreams and passions. Despite his optimistic nature, he has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or irreverent to those who don't know him.

**Interests:**

* Art: Watanabe is an accomplished painter and sketch artist, often expressing himself through vibrant, abstract works.
* Music: He's a fan of alternative rock and indie folk music, with a deep appreciation for artists like Radiohead and Arcade Fire.
* Travel: Watanabe has a restless spirit and loves exploring new places, whether it's backpacking through Europe or visiting hidden corners of his own city.

**Background:** Watanabe Schulz is a creative entrepreneur who runs his own art studio, where he teaches classes and workshops in various mediums. When not working on his latest artistic project, you can find him sipping coffee at the local caf√©, reading literary journals, or stargazing on a clear night.

Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if there's anything else I can help with!
