Based on the inspiration from your short story, I've created a character profile for Watanabe Eben:

**Name:** Watanabe Eben

**Age:** 25

**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)

**Eye Color:** Piercing blue

**Physical Attributes:** Eben has short, spiky black hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy manner. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for any potential threats. He has a lean, athletic build from years of parkour and martial arts training.

**Personality:** Eben is a free-spirited individual with a strong sense of justice. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to uncover the truth. Despite his rebellious nature, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect his friends and allies.

**Interests:** Eben is passionate about coding, hacking, and cybersecurity. He spends most of his free time learning new programming languages and experimenting with innovative security protocols. When he's not in the digital realm, he enjoys practicing parkour and martial arts to stay physically fit.

**Background:** Watanabe Eben was born in Tokyo, Japan, but spent much of his childhood on the streets, surviving by his wits. He eventually caught the attention of a talent scout who recognized his exceptional coding skills and took him under her wing. She introduced him to prominent tech mogul, Hiroshi Matsumoto, who became Eben's mentor.

However, their relationship is complicated â€“ Matsumoto wants Eben to use his skills for more "respectable" purposes, while Eben sees himself as an artist, using his hacking abilities to expose corporate corruption and social injustice. This inner conflict drives much of Eben's motivations and actions.

Feel free to modify or add details as you see fit! Would you like me to write a story around this character profile?
