Based on the short story, here is a summary of Watanabe Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Watanabe Wei appears to be a introspective and private individual. He is focused on his work and can become preoccupied with his thoughts, as evident from his blank stare at the jade pieces. However, when he interacts with others, such as Hiro or Akane, he becomes more reserved but also perceptive and calculating. His gruff demeanor suggests that he may be guarded or protective of his craft and personal life.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height:** Wei is a relatively slender man, likely in his late 30s to early 40s.
- **Eye Color:** As mentioned earlier, his eyes are an unusual piercing green color.
- **Hair:** There is no mention of Wei's hair color or style. It is possible that it is dark brown or black, typical for a Japanese man during feudal times.
- **Build:** We can infer that Wei has a slender yet athletic build due to his profession as a master craftsman and his dedication to physical labor.

**Interests:**

- **Jade Carving:** Wei's true passion lies in the ancient art of jade carving. He is known for his unparalleled skill, which he spends years honing.
- **Japanese Craftsmanship:** As a master craftsman, Wei has a deep respect and appreciation for traditional Japanese craftsmanship, particularly when it comes to jade carving.

The mysterious and intriguing aspects of Wei's personality and interests suggest that there may be more to him than meets the eye. His interactions with Akane hint at a deeper understanding of human nature and an ability to discern character, which is likely rooted in his years of experience as a craftsman and observer of human behavior.
