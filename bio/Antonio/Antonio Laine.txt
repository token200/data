**Personality:**

Antonio's personality can be described as enigmatic, elusive, and possibly mystical. He seems to embody an air of mystery, moving unseen through the streets of Paris like a ghostly presence. This aura of intrigue is matched by his intense focus on life's questions and the secrets he seeks to uncover. He appears driven by a deep longing for something unknown, but his motivations remain cryptic.

**Interests:**

Antonio appears deeply interested in music, particularly his violin. He uses it as a tool to express himself and connect with the world around him, often weaving his music into the whispers of an incantation on the wind.

It appears he seeks connection with others while still maintaining his own sense of isolation, as reflected in Sophie's observation that he seemed to be "searching for something, or someone."
