Based on the lack of information provided about Ito Yang, I will create a fictional character profile. Here's a summary of Ito Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ito Yang is a 28-year-old Japanese-British woman with an athletic build. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet toned physique, often attributed to her passion for martial arts and outdoor activities. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a striking shade of emerald green, a trait inherited from her Japanese mother. Ito has a small tattoo of a cherry blossom branch on her left forearm, symbolizing her connection to her heritage.

**Personality:**
Ito is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who embodies the essence of resilience and determination. Born in London to a Japanese mother and British father, she grew up navigating two distinct cultures, fostering her unique perspective and open-mindedness. As a natural-born problem solver, Ito has an innate ability to remain calm under pressure, making her an exceptional leader and mediator in various social situations.

**Interests:**
Ito is an avid martial artist with a black belt in karate, often incorporating its principles into her daily life. She also practices yoga and meditation to maintain balance and inner peace. Her love for travel has taken her to numerous countries, from Japan's ancient temples to the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, where she treks and explores the world's most breathtaking landscapes. Ito is passionate about environmental conservation, working with organizations that promote sustainable living and wildlife protection.
