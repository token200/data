Despite facing financial insecurity and loneliness in her success, Ito remains driven and proactive, always seeking new challenges and opportunities.

**Physical Attributes:**

It's assumed that Ito has a strong jawline, perhaps with a subtle scattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks. Her bright green eyes seem to sparkle with an inner light, giving her an otherworldly appearance.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist turned newspaper employee, Ito is passionate about storytelling, reporting, and investigation. She has a keen interest in politics, social justice, and human rights. Her curiosity and love for learning drive her to explore new topics and angles, making her a compelling and versatile journalist. Additionally, Ito's connection to nature and the ocean (as evident from her standing on the cliff) suggests she values solitude, introspection, and possibly has an interest in environmentalism or marine conservation.

It's also possible that Ito enjoys writing, hiking, or simply taking time to observe the world around her, giving her a sense of peace and perspective. Her sense of restlessness at the end of the story may indicate a desire for creative exploration, adventure, or possibly even a spiritual pursuit.
