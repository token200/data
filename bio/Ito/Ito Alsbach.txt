Personality:
Ito Alsbach is a driven and passionate individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. Her love for history, writing, and family legacy fuels her every endeavor. She is fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Ito has a natural curiosity that often gets the better of her, leading her to dig deeper into even the most mundane topics.

Despite her strong sense of determination, Ito possesses a softer side - she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to support their endeavors. Her passion for uncovering hidden truths has earned her a reputation as a dedicated historian among her peers.

Interests:
Ito's primary interest lies in regional history, particularly the lesser-known stories of her native Alsbach region. She is also deeply invested in writing and considers it an extension of her love for research. Ito is fascinated by genealogy and often finds herself drawn to obscure family histories that shed new light on the lives of those who came before.

As a historian, she has developed a particular interest in trade agreements and diplomatic relations between neighboring merchants. Her latest project, a comprehensive history of the Alsbach family's role in regional trade agreements, is her magnum opus so far.
