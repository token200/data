Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I have created a new character profile for Ito Carlburg:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green
- Hair: Graying, slicked back to reveal a prominent widow's peak

**Personality:**
Ito Carlburg is an enigmatic and introspective individual. He possesses a calm demeanor that belies his sharp mind and keen observational skills. His years as a collector of rare artifacts have honed his ability to read people and situations, making him an astute observer of human nature. Despite this, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and is guarded by his emotions, particularly when it comes to those closest to him.

**Interests:**
Carlburg's primary interest lies in the collection and study of rare artifacts from around the world. His vast knowledge of various cultures and historical periods allows him to navigate complex puzzles and unravel hidden secrets within these relics. He has an affinity for antique furniture, particularly pieces with intricate carvings or mysterious symbols etched into them.

In his personal life, Carlburg enjoys taking quiet walks through Tokyo's parks at dawn, appreciating the serenity of nature before the hustle and bustle of the city begins. He is also known to have a fondness for old books and classic literature, often reading between sessions as a collector of rare artifacts.

Carlburg's relationships are few but significant, as he guards his personal life closely. His interactions with those outside his inner circle are typically formal and reserved, revealing little about himself beyond his occupation and interests.
