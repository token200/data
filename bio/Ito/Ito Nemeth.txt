Based on the provided story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ito Nemeth:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ito Nemeth is likely of slender build, given their ability to navigate crowded alleys with ease. They stand at around 5'8" (173 cm), which allows them to move stealthily and blend into the shadows. Their eyes are a striking feature, gleaming like polished onyx in the dark. This suggests that they may have an affinity for dark colors or environments.

**Personality:**
Ito Nemeth is portrayed as confident, agile, and resourceful, with a quiet arrogance that borders on superiority. They seem to thrive in high-pressure situations, using their wits and cunning to outsmart others. Their troubled past has likely honed their skills, making them a master of manipulation and deception.

**Interests:**
It's clear that Ito Nemeth is passionate about art, as they target the city's most exclusive art gallery and remove a priceless masterpiece from its frame. They may also have an interest in safecracking and lock-picking, given their ability to bypass high-security measures with ease. Additionally, they seem drawn to the thrill of the chase, using every trick in the book to stay one step ahead of their pursuers.

Missing details that I've added to flesh out Ito Nemeth's character include:

* Hair color: possibly dark brown or black, which would complement their onyx eyes.
* Skin tone: perhaps a pale complexion, allowing them to blend into the shadows and avoid detection.
* Voice: likely low-pitched and smooth, with a hint of a mysterious accent that adds to their enigmatic persona.

These details are not explicitly mentioned in the original story but can be inferred from Ito Nemeth's actions and demeanor.
