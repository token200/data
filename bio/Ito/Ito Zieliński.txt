To further flesh out Ito's character, I propose the following background information:

Ito Zieliński was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a family of artists and musicians. His parents encouraged his creative pursuits from an early age, instilling in him a deep appreciation for art, music, and storytelling.

Growing up, Ito spent countless hours exploring the city's hidden corners, taking photographs, and playing the guitar on street corners. He developed a keen eye for observation, which served him well during his time as a freelance photographer.

As he grew older, Ito began to travel extensively, capturing images of cultures from around the world. His photography took him to Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, where he met an array of fascinating people who became friends and sources of inspiration.

Now, in his mid-twenties, Ito is a seasoned photographer with a growing portfolio and a passion for telling stories through his lens.
