Here's a summary of the fictional character Luke Roy:

**Physical Attributes:** Luke stands at 6'1" tall, with dark hair that is often mussed and unkempt. His eye color is a deep brown, almost black, which seems to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline and piercing eyes that seem to see right through people.

**Personality:** Luke is a complex and introspective person, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to make amends for past mistakes. He is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or distant to those who don't know him, but once you get to know him, he reveals a deep sense of compassion and empathy. As a detective, Luke has seen his fair share of darkness, but it's moments like these that remind him why he became a cop in the first place: to bring justice to those who've been left behind.

**Interests:** Luke is passionate about solving mysteries and bringing justice to victims and their families. He is driven by a strong sense of curiosity and is always on the lookout for new leads and clues. In his free time, Luke enjoys reading and researching cases that he's worked on in the past, often pouring over old files and interviewing witnesses.

Despite his tough exterior, Luke has a soft spot for young people and underdogs, which makes him particularly invested in mentoring and guiding rookie cops like Rachel. He is also deeply personal about his own past, having struggled with guilt and helplessness after witnessing a young girl's murder as a teenager. This experience drives much of his professional life and informs his commitment to justice.

Overall, Luke is a complex and multi-faceted character who is driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for those in need.
