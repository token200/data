Based on the short story, here is a summary of Emilia de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Emilia is intelligent, witty, and passionate about art and literature. She is independent and focused on her own pursuits, which sets her apart from the expectations of her privileged upbringing as a member of the Medici family. Despite being surrounded by luxury and extravagance, Emilia's heart belongs to something more meaningful - the world of classical texts, poetry, and creative expression.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black, with hints of green around the iris
* Hair: Long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall
* Skin: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle golden glow from spending time outdoors

**Interests:** Emilia's love for art and literature is all-consuming. She spends hours poring over ancient texts, practicing poetry, and observing the master artisans at work in Florence's workshops. Her favorite authors include Dante Alighieri and Petrarch, and she is particularly fond of classical Italian sonnets. In her free time, she enjoys strolling along the Arno River with Giovanni, watching the sunset over the terracotta rooftops, and getting lost in the city's winding streets.

**Other Details:** Emilia's family background as a member of the Medici dynasty gives her access to exclusive social events and cultural experiences, but she prefers to use this privilege to explore the world of art and literature rather than indulging in extravagant parties or lavish displays. She is also fascinated by fashion trends and keeps up with the latest styles from Florence's top designers.

Overall, Emilia de' Medici is a creative and introspective young woman who finds joy in the world of art and literature. Her unique personality and interests make her a compelling character, and her hidden vulnerabilities will likely be revealed as she navigates the complexities of court life and her blossoming feelings for Giovanni.
