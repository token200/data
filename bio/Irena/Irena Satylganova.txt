Here's a summary of Irena Satylganova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Irena is a slender woman with long, dark hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep brown color that seem to bore into those she meets, giving away her sharp intellect. She stands at approximately 5'7" (170 cm), which is slightly above average height for a Russian woman.

**Personality:** Irena is a fiercely intelligent and analytical person who approaches problems with a logical mind. As a forensic scientist, she has honed her skills in observation and deduction to become one of the best in her field. However, this sharpness can also make her come across as aloof or detached, especially when it comes to social relationships. Despite this, Irena has a deep sense of justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth, even if it means putting herself in harm's way.

**Interests:** Outside of work, Irena is an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. She is also an accomplished pianist and has been playing since childhood, finding solace in music during her most stressful times. In her free time, Irena often walks through the Moscow streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the city she loves.

One additional detail that can be added to Irena's character profile is that she has a subtle habit of tapping her left foot when deep in thought or concentrating on a problem. This nervous tic is barely noticeable to others but becomes increasingly apparent as the pressure builds.
