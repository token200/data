Since Sarah Põld is not a real character and there's no short story to draw from, I'll create a fictional profile for her.

**Physical Attributes:**
Sarah Põld is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a bright shade of blue, almost cerulean in color, which seem to sparkle with curiosity. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a sprig of lavender on her left wrist and often wears a silver necklace with a tiny pendant in the shape of a leaf.

**Personality:**
Sarah is an independent and free-spirited individual who values honesty and authenticity above all else. She's fiercely loyal to those she cares about, but can come across as aloof or standoffish to strangers due to her tendency to keep people at arm's length. As a nature lover and a fan of folklore, Sarah has a deep connection with the natural world and often seeks guidance from ancient myths and legends.

**Interests:**
Sarah is passionate about botany, particularly studying medicinal herbs and plants. She spends much of her free time exploring the woods and meadows around her village, collecting rare specimens and experimenting with their properties. She's also an avid reader, devouring books on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales from all over Europe.

In addition to these interests, Sarah enjoys practicing herbalism, playing the lute (an ancient instrument she's recently taken up), and participating in local festivals and celebrations that honor the old traditions of her village.

If you'd like me to create a short story featuring Sarah Põld, I can try writing one based on this character profile. Just let me know!
