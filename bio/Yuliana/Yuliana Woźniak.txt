Here's a summary of Yuliana Woźniak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Yuliana is a petite woman with an unassuming presence, standing at approximately 5'4" (162.56 cm). Her hair is dark brown, often styled in loose waves that fall down her back like a curtain. Her eyes are an arresting shade of indigo, almost black, but with hints of purple undertones that seem to shimmer in the right light.

**Personality:**
Yuliana is an enigmatic figure, with a reserved and introspective demeanor that belies her raw emotional depth as a singer-songwriter. She exudes a quiet confidence and intensity, which draws people to her music without making her feel like a spectacle. Her past remains shrouded in mystery, but it's clear that she has experienced both pain and joy, and these emotions inform the very essence of her art.

**Interests:**
Yuliana is deeply passionate about storytelling through music, with a strong connection to the poetic traditions of Eastern Europe (she identifies as Polish-born). She draws inspiration from the fragmented narratives of her own life experiences, alongside the abstract themes of mythology, folklore, and existential crises. Her interests also extend to:

* The art of weaving stories and crafting lyrical puzzles that evoke multiple interpretations.
* Exploring the emotional resonance between memory, identity, and human connection in her music.
* Attending avant-garde performances, surrealist installations, and underground literary events, which fuel her creative fire.

**Recreational Interests:**
When not creating new music or performing, Yuliana can often be found sipping coffee at a quiet café, scribbling lyrics by hand in a worn notebook, or lost in thought amidst the city's labyrinthine streets. She is known to enjoy moonlit walks along forgotten waterways and contemplative strolls through abandoned gardens, where she finds solace in solitude and creative introspection.

**Goals:**
Yuliana aims to continue crafting music that captures the human experience – imperfect, complex, and richly textured – using her stories as a way to connect with others on a deep level.
