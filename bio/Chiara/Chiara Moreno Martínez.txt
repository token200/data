**Personality:**
Chiara is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, she appears tough and unapproachable, with a commanding presence that commands respect in the business world. However, beneath this exterior lies a heart of gold, full of vulnerability and a deep desire for connection. She has a quick wit and sharp tongue, often used to deflect those who try to get too close to her. Despite this, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Chiara has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish at times, but those who know her well understand that these traits are merely a facade.

**Interests:**
Chiara's passions lie in business, finance, and investing. She is highly intelligent and strategic, always looking for ways to improve her investments and grow her wealth. Outside of work, she enjoys exploring the city with Marco (although she hasn't yet revealed this to him), trying out new restaurants and cafes, and practicing yoga to maintain a sense of balance in her life.

As Chiara navigates her newfound connection with Marco, she finds herself drawn to his kind heart, infectious laugh, and genuine interest in getting to know the real her.
