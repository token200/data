Based on the brief backstory provided, I've created a summary of Chiara Kalniņš's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Chiara Kalniņš is a 25-year-old Lithuanian-Latvian artist with an unassuming presence. She stands at about 5'6" (168 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a deep shade of indigo, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea's darkest nights. Her dark brown hair often falls in loose waves down her back, and she sports a small tattoo of a traditional Latvian pattern on her left wrist.

**Personality:**
Chiara Kalniņš is a creative soul with a quiet confidence that commands attention. She possesses an innate curiosity, which drives her to explore the intersections between tradition and technology in her art. Chiara's passion for environmentalism and social justice is evident in her work, and she is not afraid to speak her mind on these topics. Her warm smile can put even the most seasoned art critics at ease, making her a beloved figure in the art community.

**Interests:**
Beyond her art, Chiara Kalniņš has a deep appreciation for traditional folk music and dance from both Lithuania and Latvia. She often finds inspiration in the intricate patterns of Latvian wooden carvings and the vibrant textiles of Lithuanian embroidery. When not creating art, she can be found practicing yoga or exploring the city's hidden corners with her camera, capturing moments that evoke a sense of community and connection.
