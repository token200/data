In addition to her professional interests, Marie seems to have a nostalgic interest in her childhood experiences, particularly her visits with her mother to vintage shops and thrift stores in Paris. Her "treasure" is also an old laptop that she built herself, suggesting that she values hands-on projects and DIY endeavors.
