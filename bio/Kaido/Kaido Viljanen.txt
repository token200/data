As for interests, Kaido is clearly a man of action, preferring hands-on missions over desk work. He has a deep respect for intelligence and strategy, as evidenced by his ability to navigate the complex web of clues and security systems that led him to confront Erebus.

Kaido also appears to have a strong sense of loyalty and trust, as he readily agrees to help Elara Vex despite her unclear motivations. This suggests that he values reliability and cooperation above all else, even in high-pressure situations where mistakes can be deadly.

It's clear, however, that he has a strong sense of self-preservation and will stop at nothing to complete his missions, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.
