**Personality:** Despite his intimidating appearance and reputation as a ruthless pirate, Kaido has a complex and troubled mind. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, stemming from years of being bullied and belittled by others. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a vulnerable individual who struggles with feelings of emptiness, isolation, and moral ambiguity.

**Interests:** Kaido's interests seem to revolve around his pirate persona, seeking thrill and adventure on the high seas. He is driven by a desire for power, wealth, and recognition, which often leads him down dark paths. However, with the arrival of Aria in his life, he begins to explore other passions and interests, such as questioning morality and finding purpose beyond his pirate persona.
