Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' life and writings, I have created a fictional character profile for Marija Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Dark brown with a hint of golden brown
* Hair: Wavy, dark brown hair that often falls across her forehead
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle warmth to it

**Personality:**

* Marija Luis Borges is a creative and introspective individual, often lost in thought as she navigates the complexities of human existence.
* She has an insatiable curiosity for knowledge and is drawn to the mysteries of philosophy, literature, and art.

* Despite her introspective nature, she has a dry sense of humor and can be quick-witted when provoked.

**Interests:**

* Philosophy (especially existentialism and phenomenology)
* Literature (a particular fondness for 19th- and 20th-century authors like Kafka, Camus, and Woolf)
* Art (Marija Luis Borges appreciates the works of abstract expressionists like Pollock and Mir√≥)
* Music (she has a soft spot for jazz and classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes)

**Habits:**

* Marija Luis Borges often finds solace in writing in her journal, pouring out her thoughts and emotions onto the page.

This fictional character profile captures the essence of Jorge Luis Borges' spirit, while introducing new attributes that reflect Marija Luis Borges' unique personality and interests.
