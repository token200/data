Her bright hazel eyes seem to sparkle with creativity, reflecting the depth of her emotions and artistic vision. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, a testament to her Czech heritage.

**Personality:** Marija is an introspective and passionate individual, deeply invested in her art and its ability to express her true self. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, refusing to compromise her creative vision for the sake of fame or fortune. Despite this, she has a kind and empathetic heart, often channeling her emotions into her work to help others connect with their own feelings.
