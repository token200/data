**Personality:** Marija Liebad is a skilled huntress and tracker who has honed her skills over centuries. She appears to be fiercely independent and driven by a sense of duty. Her initial hesitation when facing the Nightwalker suggests that she is not as hardened as one might expect from someone with her experience, implying a depth of emotional complexity. Marija seems to possess a strong sense of justice and a willingness to challenge traditional views on creatures like the Nightwalker.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Marija's height is not explicitly stated, but based on her ability to navigate dark alleys with ease and move swiftly through crowded streets, it can be inferred that she is likely around 5'8" to 6'0" (173 cm - 183 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: The story does not provide a clear description of Marija's eye color, but given her rugged profession and the dim lighting in which she operates, it is possible that she has piercing green or blue eyes.

**Interests:** As a skilled huntress and tracker, Marija likely enjoys activities such as:

* Tracking and hunting exotic creatures
* Exploring hidden corners of the city and its surroundings
* Developing her skills with various forms of combat and self-defense

Marija's encounter with the Nightwalker also suggests that she may have an interest in mythology and folklore, particularly when it comes to understanding and respecting creatures often misunderstood or feared by humans.

It is worth noting that Marija's transformation into a guardian, protecting both humans and beasts alike, implies that she has a strong sense of empathy and compassion.
