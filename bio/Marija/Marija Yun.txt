**Interests:** Marija Yun is passionate about journalism, politics, history, and human rights. She enjoys reading books on these topics, attending lectures, and participating in debates. Her interest in investigative reporting and expos√©-style journalism drives her to uncover the truth and shed light on stories that others are too afraid to touch.

Additional details: Marija Yun has a collection of eclectic tattoos on her arms, which she got during her time as an intern at the local newspaper. She is also an avid fan of punk rock music and often listens to it while working on her investigations. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray animals and volunteers at a local animal shelter in her free time.

It's worth noting that Marija Yun's character was already somewhat fleshed out in the short story, so I've tried to expand on her existing traits rather than create entirely new ones.
