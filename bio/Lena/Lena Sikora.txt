Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Lena Sikora's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Lena appears to be confident, determined, and eager for a challenge. She has a strong sense of potential and is willing to learn from her mentor, Arlo Vex. However, she also struggles with recklessness, suggesting that she may be impulsive at times. Despite this, she seems to have a calm and collected exterior, as evidenced by her ability to adjust her jacket in front of the mirror before heading out on a mission.

Physical Attributes: Lena's physical attributes are not extensively detailed in the story, but based on the description of her attire, it can be inferred that she is likely tall and slender. The fact that she has to adjust her black leather jacket suggests that she may have a fitted or tailored look, which could indicate a athletic build.

Her eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but since Arlo's eyes are described as "piercing blue," it is possible that Lena's eyes are also blue. However, this can be assumed to be speculative at best.

Interests: Lena seems to have an interest in stealth and deception, as she has been training with her mentor, Arlo Vex, on these skills. She also appears to be drawn to high-stakes missions and is willing to take risks to prove herself. Her enthusiasm for the unknown target that Arlo has set up for them suggests that she is motivated by excitement and a desire for adventure.

It's worth noting that Lena's interests may evolve over time as she continues to learn and grow under Arlo's guidance.
