Here's a summary of the fictional character Carla Dupuis:

**Physical Attributes:** Carla is likely in her mid-to-late 50s or early 60s, with a slender yet mature build. She has long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall, and warm hazel eyes that seem to hold a deep sadness and introspection. Her height is approximately 5'7", which may have been slightly shorter when she was younger.

**Personality:** Carla is a complex, introspective person with a rich emotional life. She's a collector of memories and has a tendency to hold onto the past, but as the story suggests, she's also learned to let go and find peace in the present. She's independent and self-sufficient, having navigated the world alone after her parents passed away, and this experience has given her a unique perspective on life. Despite her reserve, Carla is capable of deep emotional expression and can be moved to tears by memories of past love.

**Interests:** Carla's greatest interests are collecting memories, preserving the past, and reflecting on her experiences. She's fascinated by history, art, literature, and music, often using these things as a way to connect with others and understand herself better. Her love of postcards, in particular, suggests that she has a fondness for tangible objects that evoke emotions and tell stories.

**Other Details:** Carla's life has been marked by loneliness and loss, but also by moments of beauty and connection. She's had few close relationships over the years, preferring to keep people at arm's length as she navigates her complex emotional landscape. Her love of Pierre, a soldier who left an indelible mark on her life, suggests that she's been drawn to charismatic, passionate individuals throughout her life.

Overall, Carla Dupuis is a rich, multidimensional character with a deep emotional resonance and a compelling backstory. Her story is one of self-discovery, love, loss, and the power of letting go.
