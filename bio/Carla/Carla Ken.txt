Her artistic process seems all-consuming, and she becomes completely absorbed in her work, barely acknowledging those around her. This intensity suggests a strong passion and dedication to her craft, but also hints at a possibly introverted or private personality. Her piercing eyes seem to hold a deep wisdom and understanding, which is reinforced by the sense of connection she shares with Lily.

**Physical Attributes:** Carla Ken is described as standing at an easel, suggesting a relatively tall stature. However, no specific height is mentioned in the story.

This interest in conveying the complexities of human experience may be a driving force behind her artistic endeavors.
