Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Carla Bērziņš:

**Name:** Carla Bērziņš
**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s
**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)
**Eye Color:** Hazel with a golden brown ring around the iris, reminiscent of Latvian landscapes

**Personality:** Carla is a creative and driven individual with a passion for art. She is determined and resilient in the face of challenges, having overcome obstacles as a young woman in a male-dominated field. Carla is also introspective and self-motivated, often spending hours lost in her own world as she works on her craft.

**Interests:** Carla's love for Latvia and its culture is evident in her artwork, which reflects her passion for the country's landscapes, people, and traditions. She enjoys exploring the forests, coastal towns, and villages of Latvia, taking in the sights and sounds of the Baltic Sea. In addition to art, Carla values natural light, music, and quiet moments of solitude.

**Physical Attributes:** Carla has long, dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her hazel eyes sparkle with creativity, while her small nose and smattering of freckles add a touch of whimsy to her features. Her tall and slender build allows her to move easily between the studio and art galleries, carrying heavy canvases and easels with ease.

**Additional Details:** Carla's full name, Carla Bērziņš, reflects her heritage as a Latvian artist. The surname "Bērziņš" is of Latvian origin, meaning "oak tree," which may be a nod to her connection to nature and the Baltic region.

Please note that this character profile is based on the provided story about Carla Bernard, with some adjustments to reflect the fictional name Carla Bērziņš.
