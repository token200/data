Here's a summary of Carla Jensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Carla is a complex and introspective individual who struggles with letting go of control. As the owner of Jensen's Jewelers, she has always been driven to succeed, but this fixation on perfection has led to burnout and stress. However, as she stands at the edge of the ocean, she begins to show signs of vulnerability and openness to change. Carla is a creative problem-solver who is willing to confront her flaws and trust others.

**Physical Attributes:** Carla is a tall woman with a slender build, likely around 5'9" (175 cm) in height. Her eye color is blue-green, a unique shade that hints at her connection to the ocean. Her hair is a dark brown, shoulder-length bob that frames her heart-shaped face and accentuates her expressive features.

**Interests:** Carla's love for the ocean is more than just a casual interest; it's an integral part of her being. She has always been drawn to its power and tranquility, finding solace in its rhythms and moods. As she grows older, Carla begins to appreciate the beauty of impermanence and the importance of adapting to change. This newfound appreciation for uncertainty is sparked by her encounters with the ocean's unpredictability.

In addition to her love for nature, Carla has a passion for entrepreneurship and business management. However, she struggles to balance her desire for control with the need to let go and trust others. As she embarks on this new chapter in her life, Carla will need to reconcile these competing desires and find a sense of harmony between her professional and personal selves.
