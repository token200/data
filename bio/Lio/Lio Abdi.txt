**Personality:**
Lio is an enigmatic and brooding individual with a mysterious past. He possesses an air of detachment, as if observing the world around him from a distance. His eyes seem to hold a thousand unspoken stories, hinting at a depth of experience and emotional complexity. Despite this, he comes across as guarded and self-reliant, only revealing fragments of himself to others.

**Interests:**
Lio is drawn to the unknown and the mysterious, often finding solace in solitude. He is an outsider who moves from place to place without leaving a trail, making him appear almost elusive or ephemeral. When he encounters Aisha, his interest shifts towards understanding her enigmatic nature and unraveling the secrets behind her piercing green eyes.

As Lio becomes more comfortable with Aisha, it appears that his interests are not so much about self-discovery but rather about being drawn to someone who resonates deeply with him on an inexplicable level.
