Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Lio Koval:

**Personality:** Lio Koval is a sharp-minded and resourceful detective who excels at solving complex cases. She has a reputation for being tenacious and fearless, often taking on cases that others deem unsolvable. Despite her tough exterior, she has a hint of vulnerability and trust issues, as evident in her hesitation to share her theory with Kaito initially. Her ability to think critically and trust her instincts makes her an effective investigator.

**Physical Attributes:** Lio stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall and has long, dark hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait she inherited from her mother. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of martial arts training.

**Interests:** Lio's primary interest lies in solving mysteries and unraveling the threads of seemingly unrelated crimes. She is particularly fascinated by the Oniwa case, which has been plaguing the city for months. Her passion for justice drives her to uncover the truth behind each case, often putting her own safety at risk.

Additionally, Lio appears to have a strong interest in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, evident from her quick reflexes and sharp instincts in the alleyway confrontation with the mysterious figure. Her ability to think on her feet and defend herself also suggests that she values self-reliance and independence.

It is worth noting that Lio's relationship with Kaito Yamato seems to be an important aspect of her life, as she trusts him implicitly and relies on his expertise in certain cases.
