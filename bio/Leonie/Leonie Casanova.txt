Here is a summary of Leonie Casanova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leonie Casanova is a determined and resourceful private investigator with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and has built a reputation for being one of the best in her field. Her keen instincts and sharp mind make her a skilled detective, but she also has a dry sense of humor and can be quite sarcastic at times. Despite her tough exterior, Leonie has a compassionate side and is driven by a desire to help those in need.

**Physical Attributes:** Leonie stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a fit and athletic build. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy bob that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a piercing green, a trait she inherited from her mother. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, which was given to her by a former client as a symbol of respect.

**Interests:** Leonie is an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on history, psychology, and philosophy. In her free time, she likes to practice martial arts and attend underground art exhibitions. She has a passion for French cinema and often spends hours watching classic films by Truffaut, Godard, or Bresson. Her love of literature and cinema is matched only by her love of solving puzzles and playing chess.

In addition to these details, it's worth noting that Leonie's mysterious past has left some questions unanswered. While she is open about her profession as a private investigator, few people know much about her personal life before she took up this line of work. Some speculate that she may have been involved in some shady dealings herself, but so far, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims.
