Here is a summary of the fictional character's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leonie Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius is a strong-willed, intelligent, and strategic leader. She is fiercely devoted to Rome and its people, and will stop at nothing to protect and secure the empire. Despite her tough exterior, she has a softer side, particularly when it comes to those who show loyalty or bravery, as evidenced by her willingness to grant leniency to the captured senators.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned due to desert exposure
* Build: Athletic and toned, likely from years of horseback riding

It is worth noting that the story does not provide any information about Leonie's face or facial features beyond her eyes. To flesh out this aspect of her appearance, we could imagine that she has a determined expression, with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline that gives her an air of authority.

**Interests:**

* Military strategy and tactics
* Politics and governance
* History and the study of ancient Rome
* Horses and equestrian sports (she is depicted riding horseback throughout the story)
* Diplomacy and negotiation

It is likely that Leonie's interests are closely tied to her role as Emperor, but she may also have personal hobbies or pursuits that bring her joy and relaxation.
