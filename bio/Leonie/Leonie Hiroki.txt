Here is a summary of Leonie Hiroki's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leonie is fiercely determined and driven by a desire for justice. She has a strong sense of conviction and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth and bring those responsible for her mother's death to account. Despite this, she has a compassionate side and remembers her mother with love and fondness. Her experiences on the streets have shaped her into a resilient and resourceful individual who is not easily intimidated.

**Physical Attributes:** Leonie stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. Her hair is dark brown, often tied back in a ponytail when she's fighting or moving quickly. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait inherited from her Japanese heritage. She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** Leonie is deeply interested in martial arts, particularly the art of Bushido, which she was trained in by her samurai clan. She values discipline, self-control, and honor, and sees these principles as essential to achieving justice and protecting others. When not on the battlefield or tracking down leads, Leonie enjoys studying ancient Japanese history and philosophy, seeking to understand the complexities of human nature and the motivations that drive people to violence.

Despite her focus on martial arts and historical study, Leonie has a creative side and is an avid sketcher in her spare time. She finds solace in capturing the beauty of Tokyo's cityscapes on paper, often using her art as a way to process her emotions and clear her mind.
