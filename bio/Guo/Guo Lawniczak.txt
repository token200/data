Guo Lawniczak is a multi-talented artist who sees music as an integral part of her creative expression. She believes that art should evoke emotions, spark imagination, and bring people together.

While exploring Tokyo's vibrant streets, Guo Lawniczak might stumble upon a small music venue or street performance that inspires her to pick up her violin and start playing. As she delves deeper into the world of music, she finds solace in its creative expression and begins to compose her own melodies. Her art becomes a reflection of her journey as a musician, with painting and drawing serving as an extension of her sound.
