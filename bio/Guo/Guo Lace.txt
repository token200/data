**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing emerald green
* Skin Tone: Smooth, pale complexion with a subtle golden glow from spending time outdoors
* Hair: Long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, often adorned with small, delicate pins and clips that add to her mystical aura

**Personality:**

Guo Lace is a complex and multifaceted individual, with two distinct sides to her personality. By day, she is kind, gentle, and nurturing, often taking on the role of caregiver to those around her. Her mother and grandmother describe her as "soft-spoken" and "diligent," qualities that have been passed down through generations of women in their family.

By night, Guo Lace transforms into Ling Er, a confident, fearless, and charismatic sorceress who exudes an otherworldly presence. She is fiercely intelligent, resourceful, and quick-witted, able to think on her feet and adapt to even the most challenging situations.

**Interests:**

Guo Lace's true passion lies in the mystical world of Taoist magic, where she spends hours poring over ancient texts and practicing intricate spells. She is drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, often finding herself lost in contemplation and meditation.

Outside of her magical pursuits, Guo Lace enjoys spending time outdoors, walking through Shanghai's bustling streets or exploring the city's lesser-known alleys and temples. She finds solace in nature and is particularly fond of the beauty of cherry blossoms and peonies.

Guo Lace also has a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature, often collecting rare books and attending cultural performances to broaden her horizons. Her love of silk weaving, passed down from her mother and grandmother, provides a creative outlet and an opportunity to express herself in a unique and intricate way.
