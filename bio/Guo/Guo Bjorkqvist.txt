Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Guo Bjorkqvist", I'll create a new character and provide them with some background information. Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Guo Bjorkqvist:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Amber brown
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey look
- Body Type: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders from years of martial arts training

**Personality:**
Guo Bjorkqvist is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and an unyielding determination. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority when he believes it's wrong. Guo has a deep empathy for those who have been wronged and is driven by a strong sense of justice. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for children and animals, which often influences his investigative decisions.

**Interests:**
Guo Bjorkqvist has a range of interests that reflect his unique personality:

* Martial arts: Guo is an expert in various martial arts disciplines, including karate and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He finds solace in physical activity and sees it as a way to clear his mind.
* Cryptography: As mentioned earlier, Guo's childhood hobby was solving cryptograms and math problems. This fascination with codes has stayed with him throughout his life.
* Collecting rare books: Guo has an extensive collection of rare, ancient texts and manuscripts that he believes hold the key to understanding the world's most complex mysteries.
