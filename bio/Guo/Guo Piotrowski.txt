Based on the short story provided as inspiration, I've created a fictional character profile for Guo Piotrowski:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown, with a hint of green that seems to sparkle when he's intense about a topic
* Hair: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt due to his intense focus on work
* Build: Slender yet athletic, with a wiry physique that belies his sharp mind

**Personality:**

Guo is an introverted and analytical person, preferring the company of his books and experiments over people. He's intensely focused on his work and can become absorbed in a subject for hours, even days, without realizing how much time has passed. This intensity can sometimes be misinterpreted as eccentricity or obsession, but Guo simply sees it as dedication to his craft.

Despite his reserved nature, Guo has a deep sense of wonder and curiosity about the world. He's passionate about unraveling the mysteries of the universe and is not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom in pursuit of knowledge. When he's excited about an idea or discovery, his eyes light up with a warm, golden brown color that seems to radiate from within.

**Interests:**

Guo's primary interest is understanding the nature of time and its relationship to space. He's fascinated by the concept of temporal mechanics and spends most of his free time researching, experimenting, and theorizing about the subject.

In addition to science, Guo has a love for classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which he finds soothing and conducive to creative thinking. He's also an avid reader of ancient texts, particularly those on alchemy and mysticism, which often spark new ideas and insights in his mind.

When not working or reading, Guo enjoys taking long walks under the stars, lost in thought, or simply gazing at the night sky, pondering the mysteries that lie beyond human comprehension.
