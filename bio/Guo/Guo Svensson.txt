Here is a summary of Guo Svensson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Guo Svensson stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build. His hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy manner, giving him an endearingly disheveled look. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seem to sparkle with intelligence. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Guo Svensson is a complex and multifaceted individual, with a unique blend of curiosity and determination driving him to solve the most baffling cases. His unorthodox methods often raise eyebrows among his colleagues, but he remains steadfast in his pursuit of truth. Guo is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish at times, but deep down, he has a strong sense of justice and empathy for those affected by crime.

**Interests:**
Guo Svensson is an avid enthusiast of Scandinavian culture, with a particular fascination for Nordic history, linguistics, and literature. He devours books on Viking mythology, Nordic folklore, and the languages spoken in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. When not working, Guo enjoys practicing his Swedish accent (much to the chagrin of those around him), listening to traditional Scandinavian folk music, and sipping coffee at local cafes.

**Hobbies:**
Outside of his work as a detective, Guo is an amateur linguist who occasionally dabbles in translation and interpretation. He finds solace in long walks through the streets of Berlin, observing people and environments with a keen eye for detail. Guo also has a secret passion for collecting rare and obscure books on Scandinavian history and culture.

**Quirks:**
Guo Svensson has a habit of carrying a small notebook and pen with him at all times, jotting down observations and insights that strike him as significant. He is also prone to muttering phrases in Swedish when deep in thought or concentrating. Despite his tough exterior, Guo has a soft spot for stray animals and is often seen walking his rescue cat, Loki, through the streets of Berlin.
