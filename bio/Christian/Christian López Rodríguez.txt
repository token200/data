He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly enthusiastic woodworking project.

Christian is a passionate and driven individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is fiercely dedicated to his craft and will stop at nothing to perfect his skills. His creativity knows no bounds, and he has an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. Christian is a natural people person, with a warm smile and infectious enthusiasm that puts those around him at ease.

**Interests:**
Christian's love for woodworking is unmatched, but he also has a deep appreciation for nature, history, and art. He spends his free time exploring the outdoors, collecting unusual woods, and learning about different techniques and styles from across the globe. In addition to his technical skills, Christian has an artistic eye, which allows him to infuse his creations with meaning and emotion.

Christian is also a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes lead to frustration and self-doubt. However, he has learned to channel this energy into his work, driving him to push the boundaries of what is possible with woodworking.
