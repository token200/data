Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Christian White's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Christian White is described as being consumed by his passion for photography. He has a sense of wanderlust, often wandering the streets with his camera in hand to capture the beauty around him. Despite his nomadic lifestyle, he has a special place in his heart for the small town of Willow Creek and returns there whenever possible. This suggests that Christian values stability and connection to his roots, but also feels drawn to new experiences and places.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 6 feet (183 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Dark Brown
* **Hair Color:** Light Brown/Blonde

Since the story doesn't provide specific details about Christian's physical appearance, I've made up these attributes based on the overall impression of the character. The dark brown eyes seem fitting for a photographer who spends time outdoors and in low-light conditions.

**Interests:**

* Photography (especially capturing the beauty in abandoned buildings, overgrown gardens, and worn sidewalks)
* Exploring new places and subjects
* Preserving memories and telling stories through his photographs
* Developing film in his father's darkroom (mentioned as a nostalgic reminder of his childhood)

Christian's interests are closely tied to his passion for photography. He is drawn to capturing the beauty in decay and neglect, and finds solace in preserving memories and telling stories through his art.
