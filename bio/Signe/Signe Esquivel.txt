Here is a summary of Signe Esquivel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Signe Esquivel is a fearless and resourceful individual with a strong sense of justice. As a former CIA operative turned rogue, she has developed a tough exterior and a quick wit to get her out of sticky situations. Despite this, she has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or irreverent at times, often using her humor as a way to defuse tense situations. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a deep-seated need for truth and accountability, which drives her to take on seemingly impossible missions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing emerald green, often hidden behind a pair of sunglasses or a mask
* Hair: Dark brown, cut short in a practical style that allows for ease of movement
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training and high-stakes operations

**Interests:** Signe is an avid thrill-seeker who thrives on the adrenaline rush that comes with taking on high-risk missions. She has a deep passion for uncovering hidden truths and exposing corruption, often at great personal risk to herself. In her free time, she enjoys staying active, whether it's practicing martial arts or hiking through dense jungle terrain.

Outside of work, Signe is deeply fascinated by technology and its potential for misuse. She spends hours pouring over hacking forums, reading up on the latest encryption techniques, and studying the dark corners of the internet. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray animals and tends to adopt any lost or abandoned creatures she encounters.

With Juan's help, Signe is also developing an interest in local culture and cuisine, particularly Mexican specialties like mole sauce and ceviche. She finds solace in the simple pleasures of life â€“ a warm sun on her skin, a good cup of coffee, or a friendly chat with someone who shares her values.
