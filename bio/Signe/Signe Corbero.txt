Based on the inspiration from Paloma (Úrsula Corberó) from "Money Heist," I've created a fictional character profile for Signe Corbero:

**Name:** Signe Corbero

**Physical Attributes:**
Signe Corbero is a petite woman with a slender build, standing at approximately 5'2" (157 cm). Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with intelligence and creativity.

**Personality:** Signe Corbero is a free-spirited individual with a whimsical sense of humor. She has a quick wit and a sharp tongue, often using her charm and charisma to talk her way out of sticky situations. Despite her carefree exterior, Signe has a deep emotional core and is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Interests:** In her free time, Signe Corbero enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, attending underground art shows, and practicing yoga. She's also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and mysticism. Her love for creative expression is evident in her own artistic pursuits, which range from painting to writing.

**Skills:** As a skilled "urban explorer," Signe has developed expertise in navigating the city's infrastructure, identifying hidden passageways, and finding alternative routes. She's also an accomplished lockpick and safe-cracker, often using these skills to aid her friends in times of need.

While Signe Corbero is not a direct inspiration from Úrsula Corberó, she embodies many of the same qualities: intelligence, creativity, and a sense of adventure that drives her to explore the unknown.
