Based on the short story, here is a summary of Signe Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Signe appears to be introspective and emotionally intelligent. She is able to navigate complex emotions and relationships with ease, as seen when she tries to process her feelings about being with him and ultimately deciding they are not meant to be together. Her ability to keep secrets from him suggests that she is cautious and may have trust issues. However, the fact that she still has strong feelings for him indicates a deep emotional connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Signe's physical attributes are described in passing, but based on the story, we can make some inferences:

* Height: Unfortunately, there is no mention of her height, so I'll leave it blank.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified, but given the description of his piercing blue eyes, it's likely that hers are a different shade. Let's assume they're green or hazel to create contrast with his blue eyes.

**Interests:** Signe seems to be an introspective person who values deep conversations and connections with others. She enjoys writing (as evidenced by the notebook entry) and may have creative pursuits, given her ability to express herself in a written format. Her love for him and desire to reconnect with him also suggests that she values relationships and meaningful connections.

Please note that these attributes are inferred from a single short story and might not be comprehensive or entirely accurate.
