Here's a summary of Felix DiCaprio's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Felix stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are an expressive shade of blue-green, almost turquoise in hue, which complements his sun-kissed skin tone. He has unruly brown hair that often falls across his forehead, giving him a perpetually tousled look.

**Personality:** Felix is a free-spirited and adventurous individual with a passion for art, creativity, and self-expression. He's known for his fearless approach to life, often taking risks and pushing boundaries. Despite his carefree exterior, he struggles with anxiety and self-doubt, which can sometimes hold him back from realizing his full potential.

**Interests:** Felix is deeply passionate about art, music, and literature. He spends most of his free time exploring the city, sketching the people and places that inspire him, and experimenting with new techniques and mediums in his studio. He's also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and history to fuel his creativity.

**Additional Details:** Felix has a habit of collecting unique objects and ephemera from his travels, which he incorporates into his art pieces. He's particularly fascinated by the intersection of nature and human experience, often depicting scenes of landscape and seascapes in his work. When not creating art, Felix can be found playing his guitar, practicing yoga, or sipping espresso at a local caf√©, soaking up the energy of Florence's artistic quarter.
