Here is a summary of Felix JÃ¸rgensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Felix is a dedicated and intense individual consumed by his work. He is driven by a strong sense of justice and has a keen analytical mind that allows him to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. His obsession with solving the Emma Jensen case is all-consuming, leading him to sacrifice his personal life and well-being in pursuit of the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Felix stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with short, dark brown hair that often appears unkempt due to his lack of grooming. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he interrogates as he searches for answers. He has a lean build from years of neglecting his physical health in favor of work.

**Interests:** Felix's primary interest is solving cold cases, particularly those involving young victims or cryptic clues. His thrill-seeking nature drives him to investigate every lead, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. In the past, he has also enjoyed reading detective novels and watching crime dramas as a way to relax, but his all-consuming focus on the Emma Jensen case has left little time for hobbies.

It's worth noting that Felix's character is heavily influenced by his dedication to his work and his personal struggles. His obsessive personality traits are both admirable and concerning, making him a complex and nuanced character to analyze.
