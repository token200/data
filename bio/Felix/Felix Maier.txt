Here's a summary of Felix Maier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Felix is a introspective and enigmatic individual with a dry sense of humor. He has always felt like an outsider, struggling to connect with others due to his unique gift and the constraints it imposes on his life. As he grew older, Felix became increasingly introverted, often feeling disconnected from the world around him. However, under Arin's guidance, he learned to harness his powers and develop a sense of purpose, which helped him become more confident and outgoing.

**Physical Attributes:** Felix stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, typical of someone who spends a lot of time outdoors. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in messy waves. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost purple when he's concentrating on his powers. Felix has a small tattoo of a clockwork mechanism on his left wrist, a symbol of his connection to the Timekeepers.

**Interests:** Felix is deeply fascinated by time and its mysteries. He spends hours studying the intricacies of chronology, temporal mechanics, and the philosophical implications of time travel. His love for puzzle-solving and riddles often leads him to investigate mysterious occurrences and anomalies that others might dismiss as mere coincidence. When he's not exploring his powers or reading about time-related topics, Felix enjoys long walks in nature, observing the way light dances through trees and watching the stars at night.

Despite his introverted tendencies, Felix has a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature. He finds solace in the works of old poets, philosophers, and musicians who understood the complexities of human existence. His favorite book is "The Time Traveler's Guide to the Ages," an obscure text that Arin shared with him during his initial meeting.

Overall, Felix Maier is a complex individual with a rich inner life, driven by a desire to understand and manipulate time itself.
