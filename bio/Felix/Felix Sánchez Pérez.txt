Here's a summary of Felix Sánchez Pérez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Felix is a passionate and charismatic individual with a heart full of love. He has a natural talent for connecting with people through music, but struggles with self-doubt and ego, particularly when it comes to his dominating presence in the duo. Despite this, he is determined, driven, and fiercely loyal to those he cares about. As he grows and matures, Felix learns to balance his individuality with collaboration and humility.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm brown eyes that sparkle with intensity when he performs
* Hair Color: Dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt, but always stylishly tousled
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned skin that glows with a warm, golden undertone from years spent performing under the Spanish sun
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a strong lower half that speaks to his love of flamenco dancing

**Interests:** Music is Felix's everything. He's a true aficionado of flamenco and salsa, but also draws inspiration from modern styles like indie-rock and electronic music. When he's not performing or writing songs, you can find him exploring the streets of Barcelona, practicing guitar, or lost in thought at his favorite tapas bar.

In addition to music, Felix is deeply passionate about social justice and community building. He believes that art has the power to bring people together and inspire positive change. He's an active supporter of local charities and music education programs, using his platform to amplify underrepresented voices and support emerging artists.

Felix is also a bit of a hopeless romantic, always chasing love and connection in all its forms. He's been known to get lost in the streets of Barcelona at midnight, searching for that elusive spark that sets his heart aflame.
