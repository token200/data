Here is a summary of the fictional character Felix Durand:

**Physical Attributes:**
Felix Durand is a man in his mid-40s with an athletic build. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) and has short, dark brown hair that is often messy and unkempt. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that seems out of place in the gray, rain-soaked streets of Paris where he resides. Felix's features are angular and chiseled, giving him a rugged, hard-boiled appearance.

**Personality:**
Felix is a private and introverted individual with a dry sense of humor. He is a man of few words, preferring to listen rather than speak. This reserve is rooted in his emotionally guarded past, where emotions are as foreign to him as the sun-kissed beaches of the CÃ´te d'Azur that he has never known. Despite this, Felix has a strong sense of justice and will take on cases that others won't touch, driven by a need to uncover the truth and bring about closure.

**Interests:**
Felix's interests are centered around his work as a private investigator. He is meticulous and thorough in his research, able to piece together seemingly unrelated details to form a complete picture. When not working on cases, Felix enjoys spending time alone in his cramped office, surrounded by books, photographs, and forgotten trinkets. This cluttered space serves as a sanctuary for him, allowing him to retreat from the world outside and recharge.

**Other Traits:**
Felix is a heavy smoker, often puffing on Gauloise cigarettes when he's thinking or relaxing. He has a strong affinity for the city of Paris and its gritty underbelly, finding solace in its gray streets and rain-soaked alleys. Despite his tough exterior, Felix has a certain vulnerability, particularly when it comes to those who are vulnerable or desperate for help.
