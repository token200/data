Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Felix Tóth:

**Personality:** Felix Tóth is a complex and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to operate outside the boundaries of conventional law enforcement, which can make him appear unorthodox or even reckless to others. However, his unwavering dedication to uncovering the truth and bringing perpetrators to light makes him a force to be reckoned with in Budapest's underworld.

Felix also struggles with feelings of guilt and responsibility for his partner's death in a botched case several years ago. This weighty emotional burden fuels his drive and fuels his pursuit of justice, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Felix is likely around 6'1" (185 cm), which gives him an air of authority and presence.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he interrogates or senses out the slightest deception.
* Facial Features: Felix has sharp cheekbones, a strong jawline, and piercing eyebrows that give him a resolute expression.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Felix is deeply interested in:

* Criminology and Forensic Science: He spends countless hours studying and analyzing evidence to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.
* Music (specifically, the Hungarian rock scene): Felix has a deep love for the genre and sees its connection to his case - the sister of the missing lead singer was also part of A Sötét Músika.

His interests extend beyond the realm of crime-solving to include:

* Jazz: Felix enjoys listening to jazz music in his spare time, particularly during moments of contemplation or quiet reflection.
* Literature: As a man consumed by justice and truth, he has a penchant for reading literary works that explore these themes.

**Additional Details:** Despite his rugged demeanor and sharp intellect, Felix is not one to seek the spotlight. He prefers a humble office above a local café, surrounded by notes, papers, and mementos from past cases. When not investigating or researching, he enjoys sipping coffee while listening to music or watching the rain outside his window.
