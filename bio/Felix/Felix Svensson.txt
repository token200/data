Based on the short story, here is a summary of Felix Svensson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Felix is charismatic and charming, but also struggles with vulnerability and self-acceptance. He has a resilient spirit, having grown up in poverty and neglect, but often becomes withdrawn and isolated due to the pressures of fame. As he finds success and confidence on stage, he begins to open up and be more himself.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of auburn
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you

**Interests:** Music is Felix's first love and passion. He taught himself to play the guitar and sing in local bars and clubs before finding fame. As he rose to stardom, his interest in music only grew stronger. Off stage, Felix enjoys exploring the city of Stockholm, immersing himself in Swedish culture, and reconnecting with his roots.

It's worth noting that some details were left out or not explicitly stated in the original story, so I've used my discretion to fill them in while still staying true to the character's essence.
