**Physical Attributes:** Felix stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an angular face, sunken eyes that are an unsettling shade of piercing blue, and dark hair that often falls in disheveled locks across his forehead. His once lanky frame has become gaunt due to years of intense focus and study.

**Personality:** Felix is a brilliant and enigmatic individual who exudes an unsettling intensity when interacting with others. He has a way of making those around him feel like they're the only person in the world, which can be both captivating and unnerving. Despite his reserved nature, Felix possesses a quiet confidence that commands attention.

**Interests:** Felix's singular obsession is unlocking the secrets of the universe through mathematics and physics. He spends countless hours poring over complex equations, conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory above his family's garage, and delving into the mysteries of the cosmos. His all-consuming passion for discovery often takes priority over everything else, including relationships and personal well-being.

It is worth noting that Felix seems to be someone who is completely consumed by their work and has a tendency to put other things aside in order to satisfy his curiosity about the universe.
