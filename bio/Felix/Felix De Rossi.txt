Here is a summary of Felix De Rossi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Felix is a complex character with a mix of traits that set him apart. On one hand, he is a skilled getaway driver who has been involved in high-stakes jobs in New York City's underworld, indicating that he is confident, resourceful, and possibly ruthless. However, behind the wheel, he is also shown to be a recluse who values his alone time and takes care of stray cats, revealing a softer side. He appears to have a strong sense of loyalty and compassion, as evidenced by his willingness to help a missing socialite find her cat.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story doesn't provide explicit details about Felix's physical appearance, including his height and eye color. However, based on the context, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Felix is likely of average build and height, possibly around 5'9" (175 cm) to 6'1" (185 cm), considering that he has been involved in driving high-performance vehicles and still manages to hold his own.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly stated, but given the urban underworld persona he portrays, it's possible that Felix has piercing blue or green eyes, which would be striking against his dark features.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Felix has a strong affinity for stray cats and collects cat figurines. He also appears to have a deep appreciation for fast cars, as evidenced by the fact that he sold his prized 1969 Mustang but still keeps an eye on it. In his new life in Miami, Felix values quiet moments of solitude and connection with nature, as seen when he checks on his feline friends.

Overall, Felix is a multifaceted character who walks a fine line between toughness and vulnerability, leaving behind a trail of subtle stories that hint at the complexities beneath his seemingly tough exterior.
