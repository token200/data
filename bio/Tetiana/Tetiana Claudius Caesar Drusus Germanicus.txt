**Personality:** Tetya is a determined and independent individual who longs to forge her own path in life. Despite growing up with privilege and expectation as a member of the imperial family, she feels suffocated by the weight of her family's legacy and desires freedom to explore the world beyond Rome. She is introspective and contemplative, often lost in thought as she gazes out at the city below. However, when surrounded by loved ones or faced with challenges, Tetya displays a strong sense of determination and courage.

**Physical Attributes:** Tetya stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a bright, piercing blue, a trait she inherited from her father's family. She has a small nose and full lips, giving her a heart-shaped face and a subtle, elegant appearance.

**Interests:** Tetya's interests lie in exploration, adventure, and self-discovery. She is drawn to the thrill of discovery and the unknown, often feeling restless when confined to the palace walls or limited by her family's expectations.

Outside of her imperial duties, Tetya enjoys spending time with friends and loved ones, engaging in lively conversations, and sharing laughter and stories. She is also a skilled horseback rider and has a deep appreciation for nature, often finding solace in the great outdoors when she needs to clear her mind.
