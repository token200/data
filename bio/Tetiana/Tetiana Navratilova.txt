Based on the inspiration provided by Martina Navratilova's story, I have created a fictional character profile for Tetiana Navratilova:

Physical Attributes: 
Tetiana Navratilova stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with long, dark brown hair and expressive hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with determination. Her athletic build is evident even when she's not on the court.

Personality:
Tetiana is a fiercely independent individual who has learned to rely only on herself. Growing up as an immigrant in a new country can shape one's perspective and resilience, and Tetiana embodies these qualities. She is confident, yet humble, with a strong sense of justice that drives her actions off the court as much as they do on it.

Interests:
Outside of tennis, Tetiana has a deep love for music and art. As an avid pianist, she often finds solace in classical music when the pressure of competition becomes overwhelming. Her artistic side also expresses itself through photography and writing, where she explores themes of social justice and equality.

Background: 
Born in Budapest, Hungary to Czech parents who had fled persecution during World War II, Tetiana's family history is marked by struggle and resilience. From a young age, she was encouraged by her parents to pursue her passion for sports, with tennis becoming an integral part of her life. Her success on the court has inspired countless fans around the world and serves as a powerful reminder of hope in the face of adversity.

In terms of overall personality, Tetiana is known for being driven, yet compassionate; fiercely competitive but also willing to lend a helping hand.
