**Physical Attributes:** Hannah stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her long, golden hair is one of her defining features, often blowing about her face in the wind. Her eyes are an arresting shade of bright blue, almost like sapphires in the sunlight. Her skin has a warm, sun-kissed glow from spending countless hours exploring the desert sands.

**Interests:** Hannah's interests revolve around history, literature, and archaeology. She is particularly fascinated by the works of Virgil and her ancestor, Drusus Germanicus, who was a renowned Roman general and statesman.
