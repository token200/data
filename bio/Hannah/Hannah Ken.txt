Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Hannah Ken:

**Personality:** Hannah is a creative and determined individual with a passion for art. She is enthusiastic, optimistic, and supportive of those around her, as evident in her encouragement of her best friend Emily's art residency program application. Despite facing rejections and disappointments, Hannah refuses to give up on her dreams, demonstrating resilience and perseverance.
