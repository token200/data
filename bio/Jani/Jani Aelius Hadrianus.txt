Here is a summary of the fictional character Jani Aelius Hadrianus:

**Physical Attributes:** Jani stands at 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his years as a skilled warrior and mercenary. His hair is dark brown and often cropped short, revealing piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a depth of emotion beneath their surface. A scattering of scars across his cheeks and forehead attest to the many battles he has fought and won.

**Personality:** Jani is a complex individual with a strong sense of duty and honor. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having grown up without family or home to bind him to any particular institution or ideology. As a result, he operates on his own terms, driven by a code of conduct that prioritizes loyalty, discipline, and sacrifice above all else. Despite this, there is an air of quiet introspection about him, suggesting that the horrors of war still weigh heavily on his mind.

**Interests:** Jani's interests revolve around military strategy, tactics, and history, as well as the pursuit of justice and fairness in a world often marked by corruption and deceit. He has a deep respect for discipline and order, which is reflected in his admiration for the Roman legions' code of conduct during his time fighting alongside them. Beyond this, Jani seems drawn to the enigmatic and the unknown, hinting at a fascination with mythology, ancient civilizations, and the mysteries hidden beneath the sands.

Overall, Jani Aelius Hadrianus is a man of few words but immense action, driven by a code of conduct forged from his experiences on the battlefields of Gaul and forged into steel through the trials he faces in the unforgiving expanse of the Arabian desert.
