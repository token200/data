**Personality:** Jani Chia-wei is a master thief and con artist with an exceptional sharp mind and quick wit. She is cunning, intelligent, and confident in her abilities, making her a formidable opponent for those who dare to challenge her. Her ability to think on her feet and talk her way out of situations has earned her a reputation as one of the most elusive thieves in Shanghai.

**Physical Attributes:** Jani stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, suggesting she is agile and capable of quick movements. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to gleam with intelligence and mischief. Her hair is dark brown and styled in a sleek, chin-length bob that frames her heart-shaped face.

**Interests:** Jani's interests include art history, particularly 19th-century painting, and the thrill of the chase. She seems to appreciate the finer things in life, often taking time to admire the masterpieces on display at museums like the Golden Lion Museum in Shanghai.

It's worth noting that while Jani is known to go by the codename "Janice," it seems she prefers to be referred to as Jani Chia-wei, which suggests a sense of personal identity and self-reliance.
