Here's a summary of Jani Moore's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Jani appears to be a curious and introspective person who is deeply interested in exploring the unknown. She's a freelance writer with a passion for folklore and mythology, which suggests that she values knowledge and understanding over material success or social status. Her encounter with Elara Asteria sparks a sense of wonder and excitement within her, indicating that she's open to new experiences and connections.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much detail about Jani's physical appearance beyond the brief description of Elara's striking blue eyes. However, based on the context, we can infer some characteristics:

* Height: Jani is likely of average height, given that she notices a difference in stature between herself and Elara when they sit down.
* Eye Color: While the story doesn't explicitly state Jani's eye color, it implies that her eyes are not as striking or attention-grabbing as Elara's blue eyes. Perhaps Jani has brown or green eyes, which are more subtle but still captivating in their own way.
* Hair Color: The story doesn't mention Jani's hair color, so we can only speculate about this attribute.

Her research on the origins of witchcraft suggests that she values knowledge and is driven by curiosity. She's also interested in exploring the connections between myth and reality, as evidenced by her conversation with Elara Asteria.
