Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Jani Korolev:

**Personality:** Jani is intelligent and analytical, with a strong background in mathematics and engineering. However, as revealed through her interactions with Sergei, she also has a more emotional side, particularly when it comes to justice and morality. Her rational thinking initially blinds her to the true nature of the Erebus project, but after being confronted with new information, she becomes fiercely determined to stop it.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Black
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned due to her Russian heritage

**Interests:** Jani is passionate about mathematics and engineering, as evident from her work on the Erebus project. She also values justice and morality, which drives her determination to stop the sinister forces behind the project.

Additional details that can be inferred from the story:

* Jani has a reserved or introverted personality, given her tendency to feel uneasy in public (she "couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off" when stepping out of her apartment).
* She has a close relationship with Sergei, which suggests that she values trust and loyalty.
* Her upbringing and cultural background are likely influenced by her Russian heritage, although this is not explicitly stated in the story.

Overall, Jani appears to be a smart, driven, and fiercely independent individual who is capable of both logical thinking and emotional conviction.
