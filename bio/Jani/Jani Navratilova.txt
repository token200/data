Based on the provided short story inspired by Martina Navratilova, I've created a fictional character profile for Jani Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Body Type: Athletic and toned, with a strong upper body and agile legs

**Personality:**

Jani is a driven and determined individual who embodies the spirit of competitive tennis. She is fiercely independent and confident on the court, never backing down from a challenge. Off the court, she is passionate about promoting equality and justice, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community. Jani is also deeply connected to her heritage and roots in Prague, often drawing inspiration from Czech culture and history.

**Interests:**

* Tennis (obviously!)
* Fitness and wellness
* Traveling and exploring new cultures
* Advocating for social justice causes, particularly women's empowerment and LGBTQ+ rights
* Music (she is a talented pianist)
* Hiking and outdoor activities

While Jani shares many traits with the real-life Martina Navratilova, I've aimed to create a unique character profile that captures her essence while also offering new insights into her personality and interests.
