Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Archie Nov√°k's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Archie is an inquisitive and driven individual with an insatiable curiosity about the world of cryptography. He's fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to navigate complex puzzles and unravel intricate codes. His obsession with cracking the code is both admirable and slightly unsettling, as it borders on all-consuming. Despite this, Archie remains determined and resolute in his pursuit of knowledge.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost an intensity that seems to bore into those he meets
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and reflecting Archie's somewhat disheveled nature
* Build: Lean and wiry, a testament to his intense mental focus

**Interests:**

Archie is deeply passionate about cryptography, codes, and ciphers. His fascination with the art of coding has led him down rabbit holes of mathematical puzzles, cryptographic theories, and historical codes. He's an expert in cryptanalysis and spends most of his waking hours studying, experimenting, and applying his knowledge to real-world problems.

In addition to his love for cryptography, Archie has a keen interest in philosophy, particularly the connections between code-breaking and fundamental understanding of reality. His experiences with "The Shadow Weaver" have sparked a profound sense of wonder and awe for the hidden patterns that underlie all existence.

As he navigates this new realm of understanding, Archie's interests are likely to expand beyond cryptography to include fields like philosophy, psychology, and perhaps even spirituality. The boundaries between his work as a cryptanalyst and his personal life will become increasingly blurred as he delves deeper into the mysteries of "The Shadow Weaver."
