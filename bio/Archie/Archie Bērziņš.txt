Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Archie Bērziņš:

**Name:** Archie Bērziņš
**Age:** 27 (at the time of the fictional Olympic event)
**Nationality:** Latvian
**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Weight: 154 lbs (69 kg) (boxer's weight class)
- Eye Color: Bright Blue
- Hair Color: Dark Brown, often styled in a messy, athletic look

**Personality:** Archie is a confident and driven individual with a strong sense of determination. He is fiercely competitive and has a natural talent for boxing, which sets him apart from others. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, always staying true to his roots and family values.

**Interests:**

* Boxing (obviously!)
* Martial arts
* Weightlifting
* Reading (history books and biographies)
* Listening to music (Latvian folk music and classical pieces)
* Spending time with family and friends back in Riga

It's worth noting that the original story does not provide much information about Archie Bērziņš' personal life, so this profile is based on my interpretation of his character.
