**Personality:** Aija appears to be a introverted and guarded individual who has built walls around herself due to past trauma. She is cautious and wary of strangers, but also curious and open-minded. Her desire for refuge and safety leads her to take a chance on Luna, showing that she is willing to trust others when the right person comes along.

**Physical Attributes:** Aija's physical attributes are not fully described in the story, but based on the fact that she has a scar above her left eyebrow, it can be inferred that she may have some facial scars or visible signs of trauma. Additionally, since she is able to walk and move around with ease, it's likely that she is physically fit.

**Height:** Unfortunately, Aija's height is not mentioned in the story, but based on the fact that Luna is described as "tall" and imposing, it's possible that Aija may be of average or below-average height for a young adult female.

**Eye Color:** The only eye color mentioned in the story is green, which belongs to Luna. However, there is no description of Aija's eye color.

**Interests:** Based on the conversation with Luna, it appears that Aija has interests in art and music, as they are discussed during their tour of the city.
