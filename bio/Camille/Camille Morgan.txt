**Personality:** Camille is a free-spirited individualist with a strong sense of self-expression. She is confident and unafraid to be herself, even if that means standing out in a crowd. Despite her wild and unconventional nature, she has a compassionate side and is drawn to helping others through her art.

**Physical Attributes:** Camille stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet eclectic build, reflecting her artistic personality. Her most distinctive feature is her vibrant, curly hair, which often bursts forth from her head in bright colors. Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo blue that seem to sparkle with creativity.

She spends most of her days painting vibrant murals on abandoned buildings and nights performing impromptu concerts at underground clubs.
