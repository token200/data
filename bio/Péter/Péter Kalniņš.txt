Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Péter Kalniņš:

**Personality:** Péter Kalniņš appears to be a complex and enigmatic individual with a mysterious past. He exudes an air of sadness and introspection, hinting at secrets and untold stories that weigh heavily on his heart. Despite this, there is a glimmer of humanity in his eyes, suggesting a deep emotional depth. His reserved nature and low, gravelly voice suggest a sense of introversion and possibly even reclusive tendencies.

**Physical Attributes:** Péter Kalniņš is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or 40s, with an unassuming physical presence that allows him to blend into the background. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which seems average for a man of European descent. His eye color is likely a dark brown or green-brown hue, possibly hinting at Eastern European or Baltic heritage given his connection to Riga. His facial features are understated, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin, suggesting a Slavic or Nordic ancestry.

**Interests:** Based on Péter Kalniņš's behavior in the café, it appears that he is someone who finds solace in quiet contemplation and observation. He spends hours gazing out the window into the rain-soaked streets of Riga, lost in thought. This suggests a passion for nature, art, or philosophy, possibly with an interest in the city's history and architecture. The fact that he speaks in hushed tones and orders food without understanding the menu implies that he may be someone who prefers solitude and self-sufficiency.

Some possible interests of Péter Kalniņš could include:

* Photography or art appreciation, given his love for observing the cityscape
* Philosophy or literature, which might explain his introspective nature
* Music or poetry, possibly hinting at a creative side to his personality
* History or genealogy, which could be related to his enigmatic past and sense of identity

Keep in mind that these are speculative interpretations based on limited information. Further character development would be necessary to uncover more about Péter Kalniņš's interests, motivations, and overall personality.
