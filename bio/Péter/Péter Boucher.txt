**Physical Attributes:**
Péter Boucher is a tall and lean individual, likely in his mid-to-late 30s. His exact height is not mentioned, but he appears to be slightly above average stature. He has dark hair, which is neatly styled, and piercing blue eyes that seem to gleam with mischief. His sharp jawline and angular features suggest a strong facial structure.

**Personality:**
Péter Boucher is a charismatic and cunning individual with exceptional skills as a thief and con artist. He is confident, quick-witted, and able to think on his feet. Despite his mysterious past, he has a certain charm that allows him to effortlessly manipulate people around him. However, beneath this charming facade lies a complex and enigmatic personality, with a dry sense of humor and a tendency to keep people at arm's length.

**Interests:**
Péter Boucher is deeply invested in his craft as a thief and con artist. He takes great pleasure in outsmarting his marks and staying one step ahead of the law. Outside of his work, he seems to have little interest in anything beyond his next heist or partnership opportunity. This could be due to his troubled past, which has made him wary of forming attachments or getting too close to people.

However, upon meeting Sophie, Péter's demeanor shifts slightly, and he begins to show a more vulnerable side. He appears to be intrigued by the idea of partnership and potentially finding someone who understands him. This newfound connection sparks a sense of curiosity within him, leaving room for the possibility that his life might become less solitary with Sophie by his side.

It's worth noting that despite his exceptional skills as a thief, Péter Boucher does not seem to be driven by a desire for material wealth or status. His motivations appear more related to the thrill of the challenge and the intellectual puzzle of outwitting others.
