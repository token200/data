Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Péter Straume:

**Physical Attributes:** Péter Straume is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. He stands around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build, suggesting he maintains a high level of physical fitness. His eye color is a piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets, hinting at a sharp and observant mind. His features are chiseled, with a strong jawline and angular cheekbones, giving him an air of intensity.

**Personality:** Péter Straume exudes a sense of quiet confidence and authority, which is bolstered by his experience as a former Norwegian naval officer. He comes across as introspective and calculating, often assessing situations before acting. This calm demeanor makes it difficult for others to read him initially, but those who observe him closely may notice the faintest glimmer of wry humor in his eyes.

**Interests:** Péter Straume is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about the mysterious ships operating in these waters. He's intensely curious and will stop at nothing to gather information, often taking risks that put himself and others in danger. His background as a naval officer suggests he has experience with investigation and surveillance, but his latest lead indicates that this case may require more than just military tactics.

It's worth noting that Péter Straume is likely haunted by some personal demons, given the intensity of his focus on solving this case. Perhaps his past experiences have left emotional scars or a sense of unease that motivates him to dig deeper into the truth, even if it means confronting darkness and uncertainty.
