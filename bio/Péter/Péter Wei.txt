**Personality:** Péter is a deeply passionate and dedicated individual, consumed by his craft as a woodworker. He is meticulous and detail-oriented, with an unwavering commitment to preserving the past and honoring the memories of those who have come before. His fascination with woodworking has driven him from childhood, fueled by a love for storytelling and a desire to capture the secrets hidden within every piece of wood.

**Physical Attributes:** Péter stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an unassuming yet rugged presence that reflects his years spent hunched over his workbench. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a world of knowledge and wisdom within them. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and unkempt in his workshop.

Beyond woodworking, Péter's interests are more introspective, reflecting his desire to understand the human experience and connect with those who have come before.

When not working in his workshop or immersed in research, Péter finds solace in the quiet beauty of Budapest's historic Jewish Quarter, where he can lose himself among the narrow streets and ancient buildings that seem to hold secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered.
