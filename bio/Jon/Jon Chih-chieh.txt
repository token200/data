Based on the story about Kaito Yamada, I'll create a new character profile for Jon Chih-chieh. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jon Chih-chieh is an introverted and creative individual with a strong sense of curiosity and wonder. He has a dry wit and can come across as sarcastic at times, but those who know him appreciate his quick wit and clever observations. Despite his introverted nature, he has a deep love for people and enjoys listening to their stories, which often inspire his writing.

**Physical Attributes:** Jon Chih-chieh stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown, often worn in a messy mop, and his eyes are a warm, honey-brown color that seems to sparkle with curiosity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which adds to his rugged charm.

**Interests:** Jon Chih-chieh is an avid writer and storyteller who loves collecting tales from people from all walks of life. He's fascinated by mythology, folklore, and urban legends, often incorporating these themes into his writing. When not scribbling away in his notebook, he enjoys exploring abandoned places, practicing calligraphy, and listening to jazz music.
