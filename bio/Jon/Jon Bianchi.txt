Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jon Bianchi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jon Bianchi appears to be a thoughtful, introspective, and creative individual. He is driven by a passion for language, culture, and writing, which has led him to achieve his dreams as a published author. His quiet nature from childhood suggests that he may have been an introverted person who found solace in books and writing. However, as seen when he begins writing at the café, Jon also has a creative spark and is able to tap into it effortlessly.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only one physical attribute is mentioned in the story - eye color. Assuming that his eye color is brown or blue (no specific shade is mentioned), we can make some educated guesses about his overall appearance. Jon seems to have an average build, given that he checks into a hotel and walks around the city without any significant issues.

Height: Given that Jon was "a quiet kid from Ohio" who traveled extensively as a writer, it's likely that he has a leaner or athletic build due to regular physical activity during his travels. Let's assume he is 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which is a reasonable height for an American male.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Jon Bianchi's interests include:

1. Language and culture: He devoured books on history, philosophy, and literature, and practiced French with his high school teacher.
2. Writing: His passion for writing drove him to pursue a career as a writer and publish his debut novel, "The Language of Silence."
3. Travel: As a published author, Jon is now traveling the world to promote his book, which suggests that he values experiencing new cultures and places.

Other possible interests that can be inferred from the story include:

1. History and philosophy: Given his interest in books on these subjects, it's likely that Jon has a deep understanding of various historical periods and philosophical concepts.
2. Food and wine: Although not explicitly mentioned, traveling to Paris suggests that Jon may appreciate local cuisine and wine.
3. Architecture and art: His visit to the Eiffel Tower and writing at a quaint café in the Latin Quarter suggest an appreciation for beautiful buildings and artistic spaces.

Keep in mind that these are educated guesses based on limited information from the original story, and actual details about Jon Bianchi's personality, physical attributes, and interests may be different.
