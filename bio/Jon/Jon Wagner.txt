Here's a summary of Jon Wagner's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Jon is a seasoned and dedicated NYPD homicide detective who has seen his fair share of traumatic events. He appears to be haunted by his past experiences, as evident from the lingering memories that still affect him. However, despite this, he still feels a sense of responsibility and duty towards justice, which motivates him to take on cases like the missing girl's disappearance. His personality is also characterized by a mix of gruffness and loyalty, as seen in his response to Mike's support and his willingness to work with his partner.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Jon's height, weight, or other physical attributes. However, based on the description of him smiling grimly and having a "rugged" appearance (as mentioned by Mike), it can be inferred that he is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, with a strong build that suggests regular physical activity.

**Eye Color:** The story does not explicitly state Jon's eye color, but given his rugged and seasoned appearance, it's possible that he has dark or brown eyes that have deepened with age.

**Interests:** As a former homicide detective, Jon appears to be deeply invested in justice and uncovering the truth. He is driven by a sense of responsibility to those affected by crime, particularly in cases where innocent people are involved (as seen in the missing girl's disappearance). His interest in solving the case suggests that he still values his role as an investigator and enjoys the intellectual challenge that comes with it.

**Other Interests:** There are no explicit mentions of Jon's personal interests or hobbies beyond his work. However, given his background and personality, it's possible that he may enjoy activities that involve physical exercise, strategy, or problem-solving (e.g., reading true crime books, engaging in martial arts training, or participating in puzzles).
