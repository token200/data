Here is a summary of Jon Larsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jon Larsen is a resilient and determined individual who has grown accustomed to solitude and hardship. As a former soldier, he has developed a strong sense of self-reliance and resourcefulness, which serves him well in his search for his missing brother Kjetil. However, this toughness also makes him stoic and perhaps emotionally guarded, making it difficult for others to get close to him.

**Physical Attributes:** Jon is tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his background as a soldier. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) with broad shoulders and a rugged jawline. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, giving off an intense gaze that can be unnerving.

**Interests:** As a child, Jon spent countless hours exploring the forest near his home, developing a deep connection with nature. This love for the outdoors has only grown stronger as an adult, and he finds solace in walking and hiking through the dense forests of Norway. His interest in survival skills and wilderness navigation was likely honed during his time in the military, where these skills proved invaluable.

Additionally, Jon's search for his brother Kjetil suggests that he is also driven by a sense of family loyalty and responsibility. This strong sense of duty will propel him forward as he navigates the dangers that lie ahead.

While specific hobbies or interests are not mentioned in the short story, it can be inferred that Jon values independence, self-reliance, and resilience â€“ qualities that have likely been shaped by his experiences growing up in poverty-stricken Norway.
