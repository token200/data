Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Juna Lefevre:

**Personality:** Juna appears to be a resourceful and determined individual. As a skilled thief, she has developed a strong sense of adaptability and quick thinking to survive on the edge. However, her recent job gone sour and the resulting guilt and shame suggest that she is also introspective and possibly struggling with self-doubt. Despite this, Juna shows resilience and a willingness to confront her past mistakes, as evidenced by her decision to return home.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Green
* Hair Color: Dark Brown, often worn in a messy bob
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, suggesting Mediterranean or European ancestry

While the story doesn't provide an extensive description of Juna's physical appearance, it does paint a picture of her rough and worn exterior. The "rough appearance" mentioned by Colette suggests that Juna may not prioritize personal grooming or fashion, which could contribute to her edgy persona.

**Interests:**

* Thievery (her primary profession)
* Running (both physically and metaphorically, as she flees from her past mistakes)
* Resilience and determination (driven by her desire to overcome her current challenges)

Juna's interests are largely centered around survival and evasion. As a skilled thief, she is likely highly skilled in stealth, lockpicking, and other forms of thievery. However, as she begins to consider returning home, Juna's focus shifts towards self-discovery and redemption. The map provided by Colette serves as a catalyst for her return home, suggesting that Juna may be drawn to reconnecting with her roots or exploring the idea of finding a sense of belonging.

Overall, Juna appears to be a complex character with a rich inner life, driven by both her profession and personal struggles. Her physical attributes and interests suggest a dynamic individual who is fiercely independent but also vulnerable to emotional pain.
