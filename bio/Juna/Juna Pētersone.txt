**Interests:** While Juna's work as a bodyguard and photographer may suggest that she is drawn to more rugged and intense pursuits, her true passion lies in art. She is an accomplished painter and pianist, with a deep love for music and visual art. Her discovery of photography was a chance encounter, but it quickly became clear that this medium allowed her to tap into her creative potential in a way that felt both intuitive and cathartic.

As she navigated the world of photography, Juna found herself drawn to capturing the lives of those who exist on the fringes of society - the homeless, marginalized communities, and outsiders.

Despite her tough exterior, Juna's art is deeply vulnerable and introspective, reflecting her own struggles with identity, community, and belonging. Her photographs are both powerful and poignant, revealing a world that is often hidden from view, but one that is nonetheless full of beauty, resilience, and hope.
