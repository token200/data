Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' life and works, I've created a fictional character profile for Juna Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue with a hint of green, reflecting his introspective nature
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt, with a few stray strands framing his face
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, a strong nose, and piercing eyes that seem to hold a thousand thoughts within them

**Personality:**

Juna is a complex and introspective individual, often lost in the labyrinthine corridors of his own mind. He is a passionate writer and philosopher, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the nature of reality and the human condition. His writing is characterized by its complexity, nuance, and paradoxical themes, reflecting his own inner turmoil and intellectual struggles.

Juna is also deeply introspective and self-aware, often questioning the very fabric of his existence. He has a dry sense of humor and can be fiercely independent, preferring to spend hours alone with his thoughts rather than engaging in social interactions.

Despite his introverted nature, Juna has a deep connection to his friends and fellow writers, such as Adolfo Bioy Casares, and values their camaraderie and intellectual debates.

**Interests:**

* Writing and philosophy: Juna is obsessed with exploring the intersection of literature, philosophy, and reality. He spends countless hours researching, writing, and debating with like-minded individuals.
* Labyrinthine libraries and infinite regression: Juna is fascinated by the concept of labyrinthine libraries, where every book contains another book, and so on. He sees this as a metaphor for the human experience, where our understanding of reality is constantly being rewritten and reinterpreted.
* Symbolism and mythology: Juna is drawn to the power of symbols and mythology, using them to convey complex ideas and themes in his writing.
* Personal libraries and collections: Juna has an extensive collection of rare books, manuscripts, and artifacts that he treasures dearly. He sees these as tangible manifestations of his imagination and intellectual curiosity.

Please let me know if this character profile meets your expectations or if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of Juna's personality, interests, or physical attributes!
