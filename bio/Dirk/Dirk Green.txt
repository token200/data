Here is a summary of Dirk Green's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:**
Dirk stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build that reflects his former special forces operative background. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential deception or danger. His rugged good looks have earned him a reputation as a man who exudes confidence and authority.

**Personality:**
Dirk is a man of few words, but his presence speaks volumes. He has an air of quiet intensity that can be unnerving to those around him. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can come across as somewhat sarcastic when he's not taking something seriously. As a seasoned operative, Dirk has developed a tough exterior that protects him from the emotional toll of his work, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a sharp mind and a strong sense of justice.

**Interests:**
Dirk is deeply interested in uncovering the truth, particularly when it comes to cases involving high-stakes players or those with connections to the city's elite. He has an insatiable curiosity about human nature, which drives him to dig deeper into his clients' backgrounds and follow leads that others might overlook. When he's not working on a case, Dirk enjoys long walks in the rain (as indicated by his reputation for being at home when it's pouring outside) and sipping whiskey at his favorite bar.
