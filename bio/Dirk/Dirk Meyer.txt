He exudes a sense of toughness and authority, but there is also a hint of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior. As a private investigator, he has developed a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but deep down, he is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about his own past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - Dirk's tall stature commands attention and adds to his imposing presence.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you, as if sizing you up before making his next move. His eye color is a deep shade of blue that seems almost unnatural in its intensity.
* Hair Color: Dark brown hair that falls across his forehead in a messy, unkempt style.
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and chiseled features.

**Interests:** Dirk's primary interests lie in the world of private investigation, where he can use his skills to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged. However, beneath this surface-level interest lies a deeper passion for self-discovery and unraveling the mysteries of his own past. He is driven by a sense of curiosity and a need to understand the secrets that lie hidden behind the door of his old mansion.

In terms of hobbies or leisure activities, Dirk is not particularly known to enjoy anything in particular. His focus is primarily on his work as a private investigator, and when he does have free time, it is often spent researching his family history or digging into new cases to solve. Despite this, there is a sense that he is driven by something more - a deep-seated desire for truth and understanding that goes beyond the surface-level world of investigation.
