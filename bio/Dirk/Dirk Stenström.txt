Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Dirk Stenström:

**Personality:** Dirk is a complex and brooding individual with a reputation for being fearless and unpredictable. He has a charismatic smile that can lure people into his web of deceit, but beneath this façade lies a deeply introspective and possibly troubled person. Despite his confidence and skill as a thief and con artist, Dirk has a hint of vulnerability and an inner conflict that drives him to take on high-stakes jobs.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue-green, often referred to as "glacial eyes"
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and chiseled cheekbones, giving him a ruggedly handsome appearance
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled neatly for his heists but messy when not on the job

**Interests:** Dirk's primary interest is high-stakes heists, where he can put his skills to the test and reap significant rewards. He has a fascination with rare artifacts, particularly those tied to history and mysticism. Outside of his professional life, it is unclear if Dirk has any hobbies or interests beyond his own self-preservation.

**Additional Details:** Dirk's upbringing on the streets of Stockholm likely had a profound impact on his personality and worldview. His skills as a thief and con artist were honed through years of survival, and he has developed an acute sense of awareness and cunning to navigate complex social situations. Despite his fearlessness, Dirk is not immune to doubts and second-guessing, as evident in the job where he receives the offer from the Swedish Royal Museum.
