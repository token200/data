Based on the short story, here is a summary of Błażej Simon's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Błażej Simon appears to be a introspective and emotional person who has struggled with loss and grief. He is also shown to be passionate about social justice, as evident in his past writing. However, his lack of motivation and spark in life suggests that he has been struggling to find purpose after the tragic accident that took Kasia's life.

After discovering the old notebook and re-reading his own notes on social injustices, it seems that Błażej has rediscovered his passion for telling stories and shedding light on darkness. He is driven by a fierce determination to reclaim his place as a champion of truth and freedom.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the story beyond what can be inferred from the description of his apartment. However, based on the atmosphere described, it appears that Błażej lives in a modest and possibly rundown space, reflecting his own personal struggles.

Assuming some general information about his appearance, we might infer that Błażej is likely:

* Male: The story uses male pronouns when referring to him.
* Adult: Given the mention of Kasia's fiancée status, it's reasonable to assume that Błażej is an adult.
* Possibly in his 30s or 40s: While this is speculative, it seems unlikely that he would be too young or old for a midlife crisis sparked by grief and rediscovery of purpose.

However, these assumptions are purely speculative and not directly supported by the text.

**Interests:** Błażej's interests seem to center around:

* Journalism and writing: He was once a celebrated journalist who writes now with reduced spark.
* Social justice: His past notes on social injustices suggest that he has always been interested in this topic.
* Kasia: The memory of his fiancée, Kasia, is deeply ingrained in his life, and he continues to be affected by her loss.

After rediscovering the old notebook, it seems that Błażej's interests expand to include:

* Investigating and shedding light on social injustices: He becomes inspired to write again about issues plaguing Poland.
* Storytelling and sharing truth: His passion for telling stories drives him to start writing once more, shedding light on darkness.

**Additional Interest:** It seems that Błażej has a strong affection for:

* Poetry: Kasia's favorite poems are mentioned as something he reads slowly, feeling the weight of his grief.
* Cats: He has a cat named Maja who visits him and helps rediscover a hidden compartment containing old notes.
