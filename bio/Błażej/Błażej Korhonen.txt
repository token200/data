Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Błażej Korhonen:

**Personality:** Błażej appears to be introspective, sensitive, and struggling with mental health issues, particularly anxiety and exhaustion brought on by years of intense pressure in the metal music industry. He is also somewhat isolated, as evident from his cluttered apartment and disconnection from the world outside.

Despite this, there is a spark of hope within him, indicated by his subtle smile when he considers the possibility of reforming his band with Eero. This suggests that Błażej may be more resilient than initially meets the eye, with a deep-seated desire to create music and connect with others.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height:** 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall.
- **Eye Color:** His eyes are an unsettling shade of blue-green, reminiscent of dark ocean waters, which gives him a somewhat brooding appearance. The intensity of these eyes hints at the turmoil brewing within his mind.

**Interests:**

Błażej's interests seem to revolve around music, particularly death metal and heavy rock genres. As the former lead singer of Kivimetsän Vatnik, he was deeply invested in the music scene and has a passion for creating powerful sounds that evoke strong emotions in both himself and his audience.

However, beyond this, little is revealed about Błażej's interests outside of music. His love for old records, concert posters, and collecting mementos from past performances suggest a nostalgic side to his personality, which might be tied to his sense of identity and connection to the band's history.

Given his background in death metal, it can be inferred that Błażej is likely drawn to intense experiences that allow him to express himself authentically, whether through music or otherwise.
