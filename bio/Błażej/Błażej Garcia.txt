**Physical Attributes:**
Błażej is a ruggedly handsome man with a strong build, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a thousand stories, as if they've seen everything from the darkest corners of humanity. His hair is dark and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his brooding intensity. He has a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a bar fight several years ago.

**Personality:**
Błażej is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a deep sense of vulnerability. He has an air of quiet confidence that commands attention, but also makes people wary, as if they're not quite sure what he's capable of. Despite his rough demeanor, Błażej has a sharp mind and an unwavering commitment to justice, which drives him to take on cases that others can't or won't touch. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to get to the truth.

**Interests:**
Błażej's interests are diverse and far-reaching, reflecting his eclectic background and experiences. On a personal level, he enjoys playing old-school rock music on his guitar, reading classic literature by authors like Hemingway and Cormac McCarthy, and practicing martial arts in his free time. Professionally, Błażej is fascinated by the darker corners of human nature, particularly the psychology behind obsession, manipulation, and control. He has a keen interest in forensic science and uses his skills to analyze evidence and track down leads.

**Hidden Scars:**
As revealed to Lena, Błażej has scars that only he knows about - physical and emotional wounds from past experiences that have shaped him into the person he is today. These scars are a reminder that even the toughest people have vulnerabilities, and that sometimes it's the ones who seem most unbreakable who need the most healing.
