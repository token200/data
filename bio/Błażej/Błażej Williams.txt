**Personality:** Błażej is an enigmatic and charismatic individual with a mysterious past. He has a natural talent for deception and misdirection, which he honed from his parents' performances as nomadic performers. Despite his success as a thief and con artist, Błażej feels a sense of disconnection and always looks over his shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop. However, after pulling off the daring heist at the high-security museum, he begins to feel a sense of determination and purpose.

**Physical Attributes:** Błażej is tall, with an athletic build that allows him to move swiftly and unnoticed in his missions. He stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm), with piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with intensity.

In addition to his interest in art and history, Błażej is also passionate about music, particularly jazz and classical compositions that evoke the sense of freedom and escapism he experienced on the road with his parents.
