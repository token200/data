In terms of specific interests outside of photography, Alfred enjoys playing jazz music on his saxophone (a hobby he discovered during a stint in New Orleans) and experimenting with various forms of avant-garde art. He is also an avid writer, keeping a journal where he chronicles his thoughts on politics, history, and the human experience.
