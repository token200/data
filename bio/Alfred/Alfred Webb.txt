Here is a summary of the fictional character Alfred Webb:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Light Brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a subtle weariness around his eyes due to years of late nights spent working on cases

**Personality:**

* Alfred Webb is a quiet and introspective individual who prefers to observe rather than speak up. He is confident in his abilities but doesn't seek to draw attention to himself.
* Despite his reserved nature, he has a strong sense of determination and focus, which drives him to solve complex cases.
* He is fiercely independent and values his alone time, often working late into the night to analyze evidence and piece together clues.

**Interests:**

* Alfred Webb is an avid collector of rare books on true crime and forensic science. His desk is lined with dusty tomes that he occasionally refers to for inspiration or insight.
* He has a deep love for classic literature, particularly the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Sherlock Holmes. Their attention to detail and analytical minds inspire him in his own detective work.
* Outside of work, Alfred Webb enjoys taking long walks in the rain (much like the drizzle on the evening he received the call from Lucy Rose) and lost hours browsing antique shops for rare artifacts or trinkets that might hold significance.

**Additional Notes:**

While not explicitly stated in the original story, it can be inferred that Alfred Webb is a self-taught expert with a keen mind for observation and deduction. He has an intuitive sense of justice and a strong desire to uncover the truth, even if it means challenging established theories or working outside the boundaries of conventional thinking.
