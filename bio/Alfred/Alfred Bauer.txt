**Physical Attributes:** Alfred is a tall and slender individual, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet unassuming build. His hair is dark brown and often worn neatly trimmed, framing his face with a subtle elegance. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that has earned him the nickname "The Blue-Eyed Ghost." He sports a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly close call in Istanbul.

**Personality:** Alfred is a calm and collected individual with an air of quiet confidence that commands respect. His exceptional ability to read people makes him an excellent profiler, but it also makes him wary of others' intentions. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and enjoys the art of storytelling, often weaving intricate cover stories to suit his needs. Alfred is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else, which sometimes puts him at odds with The Agency's more rigid structures.

* Travel: He loves exploring new destinations, immersing himself in local cultures, and learning about the intricacies of international politics.

* Literature: He enjoys reading classic novels, biographies, and works on psychology, which helps him better understand human behavior.
* Music: Alfred has a soft spot for jazz and classical music, often listening to these genres when on assignment or unwinding in his downtime.

These interests complement his natural talents as an observer and storyteller, making him a formidable asset to The Agency.
