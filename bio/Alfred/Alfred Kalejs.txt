He struggles to open up to others, but once you gain his trust, he reveals a compassionate and empathetic side.

**Physical Attributes:** Kalejs stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of intense physical training. His hair is graying at the temples, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to hold a deep intensity. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from one of his past missions.

**Interests:** Alfred Kalejs' interests have shifted significantly since his days as an operative. Fishing has become a favorite pastime, allowing him to connect with nature and clear his mind.
