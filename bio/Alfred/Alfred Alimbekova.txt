**Background:**

Alfred Alimbekova was born into a family of artists and intellectuals. Her parents were both professors at a prestigious university, encouraging her curiosity and creative expression from an early age. After completing her degree in forensic psychology, Felix began her career as a detective, quickly establishing herself as a leading expert in unconventional investigative techniques.

Despite her success, Alfred remains fiercely independent and non-conformist, often finding herself at odds with traditional authorities within the law enforcement community. Her unorthodox approach has earned her both admiration and skepticism from colleagues alike.
