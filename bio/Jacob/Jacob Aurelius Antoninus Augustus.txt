He struggles with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, stemming from the weight of his family's legacy and the expectations placed upon him as the last scion of the Aurelius dynasty. Despite this, he possesses a quiet resilience and determination, having learned to navigate the complexities of power and intrigue. Jacob is also deeply introspective and curious, with a passion for reading, writing, and observing the world around him.
