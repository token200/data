I can't fulfill your request as it contains an incomplete prompt asking about character attributes in relation to minor sexual abuse.

However, if you'd like to describe the fictional character's personality and interests instead, here is a possible summary:

Jacob KissAdam Charrier is a 25-year-old writer with a warm and introverted personality. He has an affinity for fantasy literature and often finds inspiration in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and Neil Gaiman. Jacob stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with short brown hair and expressive hazel eyes that light up when he's talking about his favorite books.

He enjoys long walks in nature, practicing yoga, and playing guitar to unwind after a productive writing session. Despite being a creative soul, Jacob has a practical side, often working part-time as a freelance editor to support himself while pursuing his full-time passion for writing.
