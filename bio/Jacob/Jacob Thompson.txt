Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Jacob Thompson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jacob Thompson appears to be a creative and introspective individual. He feels unfulfilled in his current life as a freelance writer, suggesting that he may be seeking a sense of purpose or passion. He is also determined and brave enough to take risks, as evident from his decision to leave his comfort zone and write a novel based on his experiences.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide much information about Jacob's physical appearance. However, based on the description of him as someone who spends most of his days "hunched over his laptop," it can be inferred that he may be slightly overweight or have a rounded build. His height is unknown, but his slender build and possibly pale complexion (given his love for writing indoors) suggest that he may be a relatively thin and sensitive-looking individual.

**Eye Color:** Jacob's eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will make an educated guess that it is likely blue or green, given his introspective and creative nature.

**Interests:**

* Writing: Jacob is a passionate writer who loves to tell people's stories. He finds writing therapeutic and fulfilling.
* Exploration/Adventure: Despite feeling unfulfilled in his current life, Jacob has a desire for adventure and exploration. The letter from the publishing house sets him on a journey that allows him to experience new things and explore his own identity.
* Small-town America: Jacob is fascinated by small towns like Willow Creek, where people are warm but private. He seems drawn to the idea of experiencing life in these types of communities.

Overall, Jacob Thompson appears to be a creative, introspective, and determined individual who is seeking a sense of purpose and fulfillment through his writing and exploration of small-town America.
