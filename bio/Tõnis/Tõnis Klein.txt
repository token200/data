Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Tõnis Klein:

**Personality:** Tõnis is a complex and enigmatic individual, driven by a mix of motivations. As a former KGB spy, he has honed his skills in deception and manipulation. However, beneath this façade lies a deep-seated sense of morality and a strong desire for freedom. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often finding himself at odds with authority figures. Despite his troubled past, Tõnis exudes an air of quiet confidence and resilience.

**Physical Attributes:** Tõnis stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a lean build that belies his athletic background. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a practical yet stylish manner. His eyes are piercing blue, with an intense gaze that can be both captivating and unnerving. A scar above his left eyebrow hints at a tumultuous past.

**Interests:** Tõnis's curiosity about the world beyond Estonia has led him to develop a deep appreciation for Western culture and history. He is fluent in multiple languages, including German, English, Russian, and Estonian. His interests also extend to literature, music, and philosophy, which he finds both inspiring and intellectually stimulating. Despite his love of books, Tõnis's experiences have made him wary of attachments, making it difficult for him to form lasting connections with others.

The mysterious woman who appears at his doorstep seems to possess an unsettling familiarity with Tõnis, suggesting that their past is intertwined in ways he cannot yet fully understand. Her whispered warning, "Run," has sent Tõnis on a path of self-discovery and uncertain destiny.
