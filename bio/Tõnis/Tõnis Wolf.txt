Here is a summary of Tõnis Wolf's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided story:

**Personality:** Tõnis Wolf is a complex individual with a mix of traits that define him. On one hand, he possesses an air of quiet confidence and cunning, which serves him well in his dealings with others. This confidence, however, can also be intimidating to those around him. As someone who has had to rely on his wits and fists to survive on the streets of Tartu, Tõnis has developed a resilient and resourceful nature that allows him to navigate treacherous situations. He is intelligent and calculating, but not necessarily driven by emotion or altruism.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** 6'1" (185 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you
- **Hair Color:** Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt to blend in with the shadows

Additional physical details that are not mentioned but can be inferred:

- Tõnis likely has a lean build due to his years of living on the streets.
- His height gives him an intimidating presence, which he uses to his advantage.

**Interests:** As a member of the Shadow Syndicate and someone who has seen the darker side of human nature, Tõnis's interests are centered around power, wealth, and survival. He enjoys:

- Planning and executing complex heists
- Outwitting rival syndicates and corrupt officials
- Exploring the city's underworld and gathering information about its inner workings

However, with his growing moral awareness and doubts about Lilja's true intentions, Tõnis is beginning to explore interests that are more aligned with justice and righting wrongs. These new interests include:

- Investigating the Shadow Syndicate's nefarious activities
- Seeking out allies who share his vision for a better future
- Uncovering hidden truths and bringing light to those living in darkness

These dual interests make Tõnis a nuanced character whose actions will be guided by both a desire for power and a need for justice.
