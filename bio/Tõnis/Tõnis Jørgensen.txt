**Physical Attributes:** Tõnis Jørgensen is a ruggedly handsome man in his late 40s. He stands at around 5'10" with a lean, athletic build that speaks to his former life as a spy. His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, and his dark brown hair is always perfectly styled. His weathered features, including a sharp jawline and prominent nose, give him an air of authority and experience.

**Personality:** Tõnis is a man of mystery and intrigue, with a reputation for being both ruthless and calculating in his pursuit of the truth. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of empathy and compassion. As a former spy turned private investigator, he has developed a keen eye for detail and a talent for reading people.

**Interests:** Tõnis is fascinated by the dark side of human nature and enjoys delving into the world of conspiracies and corruption. He has a particular interest in mythology and symbolism, which often helps him decipher the cryptic clues that lead him to his cases.

Despite his tough exterior, Tõnis has a soft spot for those who have been wronged or marginalized, and is always willing to take on a case that promises to uncover the truth and bring justice to its victims. His dry wit and sharp instincts make him a formidable opponent in the world of espionage and detection, and he is not one to be underestimated.
