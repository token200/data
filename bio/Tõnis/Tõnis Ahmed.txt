Since Tõnis Ahmed is not a well-known fictional character, I will create a new profile for him.

**Physical Attributes:**
Tõnis Ahmed is 5'11" (180 cm) tall with a lean and athletic build. His hair is dark brown, straight, and usually kept short. His eyes are an intriguing shade of turquoise, which seem to change color depending on the light. His features are angular, with sharp cheekbones and a small nose. He has a smattering of light freckles across his cheeks and nose.

**Personality:**
Tõnis Ahmed is a complex individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he appears calm and collected, but beneath lies a deep-seated sense of curiosity and restlessness. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. Despite this, he has a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Tõnis has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or aloof to those who don't know him well.

**Interests:**
Tõnis Ahmed is an avid reader, particularly drawn to philosophy, psychology, and history. He loves exploring new places and experiencing different cultures, often taking solo trips to destinations he's never visited before. When not reading or traveling, Tõnis enjoys playing chess and practicing martial arts (he holds a black belt in karate). His passion for language learning has taken him as far as fluency in three languages.

Feel free to modify any aspect of his profile if you'd like, and I can help create a story featuring Tõnis Ahmed! What kind of story would you like it to be?
