Here's a summary of Julia González Fernández's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Julia is a young woman with piercing green eyes, raven-black hair, and an unassuming yet elegant presence. Her height is around 5'8" (173 cm), which is slightly above average for her era. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of attending lavish parties and engaging in energetic activities like shadow puppetry.

**Personality:** Julia is a free-spirited individual with a strong desire for self-expression and adventure. Despite her privileged upbringing, she feels suffocated by the constraints of her life and yearns for excitement and purpose. She is determined and fiercely independent, willing to take risks to pursue her passions and prove herself. At the same time, Julia is also vulnerable and uncertain, struggling with the weight of expectations from others and her own doubts about El Loco's true intentions.

**Interests:** Julia is deeply passionate about shadow puppetry and performance art, which becomes a central aspect of her identity. She finds solace in the creative expression and control that comes with manipulating light, darkness, and storytelling through puppets. Her love for performance also extends to music, dance, and other forms of artistic expression. Outside of art, Julia is drawn to adventure and exploration, often finding herself at the edge of town or on the outskirts of civilization, searching for new experiences and connections.

**Hidden Aspects:** Despite her outward confidence and passion for shadow puppetry, Julia harbors a deep-seated insecurity about El Loco's true identity and motives. She struggles with feelings of guilt and loyalty towards her parents, who disapprove of her artistic pursuits, while also grappling with the thrill and excitement of performing in secret under El Loco's tutelage. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Julia is torn between uncovering the truth about El Loco and keeping her newfound love for art alive.
