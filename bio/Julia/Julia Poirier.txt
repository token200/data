Here's a summary of Julia Poirier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Julia is a introspective and reserved individual who has built walls around herself to protect from getting too close to people. As a journalist, she has developed a strong sense of objectivity and independence, which often makes it difficult for her to form deep connections with others. However, as she returns to her hometown and reconnects with her family's past, Julia begins to reveal a more vulnerable side, showing a deeper desire for belonging and connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Julia is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with piercing green eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom beyond her years. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a neat ponytail, framing her heart-shaped face and angular features. She has a petite nose and full lips that curve into a subtle smile when she's amused or concentrating on a story.

**Interests:** Julia is a passionate journalist with a keen eye for storytelling and a love for uncovering hidden truths. Her work has taken her to various parts of the world, but as she returns to her hometown, she finds herself drawn to local stories and histories that reveal secrets about the people and places around her. She's particularly fascinated by family history and personal narratives, which often lead her to dig deeper into the complexities of human relationships and experiences.

In addition to her professional interests, Julia has a deep appreciation for food, culture, and community. Her grandmother's kitchen and recipes hold a special place in her heart, and she finds comfort in simple pleasures like baking, cooking, and sharing meals with others.
