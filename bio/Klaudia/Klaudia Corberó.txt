**Personality:**
Klaudia is an adventurous soul with a heart full of wonder. She's fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Her determination and resourcefulness are traits she developed from years of working as a baker's apprentice in the small town of Villagarcía. Despite her bold nature, Klaudia has a compassionate side and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

**Interests:**
Klaudia has a deep passion for baking, which began when she was just a child watching her mother create delicious pastries from scratch. She's particularly skilled at crafting intricate desserts that are both beautiful and delicious. In addition to her love of baking, Klaudia is also an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on history, mythology, and adventure. Her fascination with the unknown often leads her to explore new places and try new experiences.
