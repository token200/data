**Personality:** Klaudia Yi-hsien is an enigmatic and introverted individual with a deep sense of determination and drive. Her troubled past has forged a strong will, which she channels into her work as an archaeologist. She is fiercely independent and guarded when it comes to personal matters, preferring to focus on unraveling the secrets of the past rather than sharing her own story.

**Physical Attributes:** Klaudia stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her eyes are an intense shade of dark brown that seem to hold a deep sadness and introspection, a trait that has led some to speculate about the secrets she keeps hidden within them. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in straight lines down her back, often tied back in a simple bun when working.

**Interests:** Klaudia's primary interests revolve around archaeology and the study of ancient civilizations. She has a particular fascination with the mythology of the Silk Road traders and the cultural exchange between East and West. In her free time, she enjoys studying languages, particularly Mandarin and Tibetan, which she believes will aid her in deciphering ancient texts.

Outside of academia, Klaudia's interests are more esoteric, with a passion for classical music and literature. She is an avid reader of poetry and philosophy, often seeking solace in the words of William Wordsworth and Friedrich Nietzsche during quiet moments in the museum.

Klaudia also has a deep appreciation for nature, finding solace in the quiet stillness of the natural world when the chaos of her daily life becomes too much to bear. She often takes long walks alone through local parks or along the coast, lost in thought as she reflects on her research and the secrets that lie within.
