Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Oleksandr Malinowski:

**Personality:**
Oleksandr is portrayed as a dogged and fearless investigative reporter. He has a sharp mind and quick wit, which enable him to uncover dark secrets in the Russian underworld.

- His eyes could be a deep brown, which seems fitting for his intense personality.
  (Please note, these are purely speculative guesses without concrete evidence.)

**Interests:**
Oleksandr's primary interest appears to be investigative journalism. He has built a reputation for himself by uncovering dark secrets and is on the hunt for leads that can make or break his career. This suggests that he is driven by a strong desire to expose truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.

His interests also include being cautious (evidenced by his wariness of Natalia's sudden contact), diligent research (as hinted at by his ability to uncover dark secrets), and pursuing leads with determination, as seen in his acceptance of the challenge presented by the businessman and his decision to follow up on the lead despite potential risks.

In summary, Oleksandr is a man driven by truth-seeking instincts, with a strong desire for justice and a willingness to face danger head-on.
