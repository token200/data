Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Oleksandr Jian:

**Personality:** Oleksandr Jian is a brilliant and reclusive physicist with an insatiable curiosity about the universe. He is intensely focused on unlocking its secrets, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. Despite this, he has a hidden talent for music and can find temporary solace in playing Chopin's Nocturnes. As he meets new people, particularly Lena, Oleksandr begins to show a softer side, displaying a sense of wonder and connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleksandr is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, with a slender build and unkempt hair that falls across his forehead. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which allows him to move easily between his laboratory and piano bench. His eyes are an unsettling pale blue, often losing themselves in the depths of thought as he ponders complex equations.

**Interests:** Oleksandr's primary interest is in physics, particularly quantum mechanics and dark energy. He spends most of his waking hours researching and experimenting with theories on non-locality, entanglement, and other cosmological phenomena. His workbench is cluttered with diagrams, equations, and various contraptions that reflect his creative genius.

In addition to science, Oleksandr has a deep appreciation for classical music, particularly the works of Chopin, which serve as an emotional release from his intense focus on research. He also enjoys traditional Ukrainian borscht and varenyky, often serving them to himself after late-night sessions in his laboratory.

As he begins to reconnect with Lena and explore new aspects of life beyond science, Oleksandr's interests expand to include the world around him, such as nature, literature, and other people.
