**Personality:** Sasha (Oleksandr) is a complex character with a mix of tough exterior and soft interior. He has a strong sense of loyalty and justice, which motivates him to help those in need, especially his friends. Despite his rough upbringing on the streets of Kiev, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty, as seen when he smiles wryly at Anastasia's tears.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, rugged nose, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Sasha is a skilled lockpicker and has an interest in security consulting. He enjoys the thrill of solving puzzles and navigating complex systems. On a personal level, he values his independence and freedom, often taking on high-stakes jobs as a freelancer to maintain his autonomy.

It's worth noting that, apart from his skills as a security consultant, Sasha seems to be a man of few interests outside of work and helping those in need. He appears to be driven by a strong sense of justice and loyalty, which guides his actions and decisions throughout the story.
