He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often pushing boundaries to get closer to the truth.

His hair is dark brown, usually neatly trimmed, and his features are chiseled, giving him a strong, masculine presence. He has wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose, which add a slightly intellectual touch to his appearance.
