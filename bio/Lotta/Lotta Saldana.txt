Based on the inspiration from Zoe Saldana, I've created a fictional character profile for Lotta Saldana:

**Name:** Lotta Saldana

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks
* Hair Color: Dark Brown with subtle hints of auburn
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, reflecting her mixed Latin American heritage

**Personality:** Lotta Saldana is a fearless and determined individual who embodies the spirit of adventure. She has a strong sense of justice and will stop at nothing to protect those she cares about. Her quick wit and sharp intellect make her an expert strategist, always thinking several steps ahead of her opponents. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and is fiercely loyal to her crew.

**Interests:**

* Space Exploration: Lotta is passionate about exploring the unknown reaches of the galaxy, discovering new worlds, and unraveling their secrets.
* Archaeology: She's fascinated by ancient civilizations and lost cultures, often going to great lengths to uncover hidden artifacts and relics.
* Martial Arts: Lotta is an expert in hand-to-hand combat and has a deep appreciation for various forms of martial arts, which she uses to defend herself and her allies.
* Science Fiction: As a seasoned space traveler, she has a vast knowledge of science fiction literature and enjoys immersing herself in the works of renowned authors like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.

**Background:** Lotta was born into a family of astronomers and engineers, which sparked her interest in space exploration at a young age. She grew up studying astronomy and mathematics, eventually earning a degree in astrobiology. After completing her education, she joined the Galactic Exploration Corps, where she honed her skills as an explorer, archaeologist, and warrior.

**Captain Zara Saldana:** As seen in the original story, Captain Zara Saldana is Lotta's counterpart in the fictional universe. She shares a similar passion for space exploration, but with a more seasoned and battle-hardened approach. The two characters are close friends and allies, often working together to overcome challenges and defeat their enemies.

Feel free to modify or add to this character profile as you see fit!
