**Personality:** Martina Saar appears to be a compassionate and empathetic individual. She has a deep understanding of human behavior and is able to connect with her clients on a personal level. Her experience as a forensic psychologist has also taught her to remain objective and analytical in the face of traumatic situations.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no detailed physical attributes are provided in the story. However, based on the context, we can infer the following:

* Height: Martina is likely an adult woman of average to above-average height, as she is able to sit across from Emma, who is a 20-year-old college student.
* Eye Color: Although not explicitly stated, it's possible that Martina has dark or warm-toned eyes, given her connection to her sister and the similar tattoo design.

**Interests:** As a forensic psychologist, Martina's primary interest lies in understanding human behavior and trauma. She is deeply invested in solving crimes and helping victims like Emma find justice. Her experience with losing her own sister at a young age has also sparked an interest in psychology and human development, particularly in relation to trauma and behavior.

It's worth noting that some details about Martina's life are not explicitly mentioned in the story, such as her family background or her profession before becoming a forensic psychologist. However, based on the context and the similarity between Emma's tattoo design and Martina's own, it's clear that this case has a personal significance for Martina and is driving her determination to solve the crime.
