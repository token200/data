Based on the provided story, I will create a summary of the fictional character Leano Wójcik:

**Personality:**
Leano Wójcik appears to be an introspective and reclusive individual. Despite his exceptional woodworking skills and talent, he maintains a low profile in the small town, with few people having ever laid eyes on him. He seems to be highly focused on his craft, as evident from his meticulous workshop organization and the reverence surrounding his work. However, when interacting with others, such as Sophia, Leano reveals himself to be warm and curious, sharing his stories and wisdom.

**Physical Attributes:**
Unfortunately, there is no direct information provided about Leano's physical appearance in the story. However, based on the description of his workshop atmosphere, it can be inferred that he might have a slender build or an androgynous appearance, allowing him to blend into the background while maintaining his focus on his craft.

**Height:**
No specific information is available regarding Leano's height, but considering his age and profession as a woodworker, it would not be uncommon for him to be of average or slightly above-average height (around 5'9" - 6'1").

**Eye Color:**
Unfortunately, the story does not specify Leano's eye color. However, given the description of Sophia's eyes being "sparkling with curiosity," it could be inferred that Leano might have similarly expressive and bright eyes, which would complement his warm demeanor.

**Interests:**
Leano Wójcik is deeply passionate about woodworking, particularly in understanding the intricacies of wood grain and crafting pieces that are almost alive in their patterns and textures. He also values sharing his knowledge with others and listening to their stories, as evident from his interaction with Sophia.
