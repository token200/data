Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Leano Avendano's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leano appears to be introspective, self-aware, and determined. He is also likely creative, as evident from his passion for writing and literature. His desire for reinvention suggests that he values personal growth and transformation. Additionally, his willingness to take risks and listen to advice from his abuela indicates that he is open-minded and receptive to guidance.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the provided text does not provide explicit details on Leano's physical appearance, such as height or eye color. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the story:

* Height: Based on the author's description of his "cluttered apartment," it is likely that Leano is a bit shorter than average, perhaps around 5'6"-5'8" (168-173 cm), which was a relatively modest height for someone in their mid-20s.
* Eye Color: Given his Hispanic heritage and the mention of his abuela's letter written in Spanish, it's possible that Leano has dark eyes, such as brown or hazel.

**Interests:** Leano is clearly passionate about writing, literature, and self-discovery. His love for F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" suggests that he appreciates classic literature and is likely an avid reader of contemporary works as well. He also seems to be interested in exploring his cultural heritage and the values instilled by his abuela.

Other interests not explicitly mentioned in the story could include:

* Creative writing (fiction, poetry, or other forms)
* Personal development and self-reflection
* Exploring alternative careers or passions
* Traveling and experiencing new cultures

Keep in mind that these are educated guesses based on a single short story, and Leano's personality, physical attributes, and interests may be more complex and multifaceted than what is presented here.
