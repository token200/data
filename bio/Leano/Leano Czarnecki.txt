- Eye Color: His eyes are a piercing blue, reflecting his tough yet intelligent nature.
- Hair Color: His hair is dark brown, with choppy layers that add to his rugged appearance.

He seems to have a mysterious past, which he keeps closely guarded, and few people know much about him beyond his impressive combat skills. This air of mystery creates an aura of intrigue around him, making people wonder what drives him and what motivates him.
