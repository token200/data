**Personality:**

Máté is a driven and ambitious individual, with an unwavering passion for music. He is confident on stage but can be anxious offstage, particularly before performances. This duality makes him more human and relatable to his audience. Máté's childhood experiences and relationships with his parents have shaped his values and motivations, instilling in him a strong sense of determination and family pride.

It's worth noting that Máté's interests are not as extensive as his passion for music, but it gives us a glimpse into what drives him and connects him with the world beyond Wildflower.

As an added detail, I've included Máté's voice characteristics: he has a powerful, emotive voice with a wide range, able to convey both vulnerability and intensity. This is particularly evident in his performances of "Echoes in the Night", which showcases his vocal prowess.
