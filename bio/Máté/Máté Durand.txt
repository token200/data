Here's a summary of the fictional character Máté Durand:

**Physical Attributes:** Máté stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often styled neatly, framing his sharp features. His eyes are a piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets, revealing a hint of intensity beneath his polished exterior.

**Personality:** Máté is a complex individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he exudes confidence and sophistication, but beneath lies a sense of insecurity and self-doubt. His past mistakes have left emotional scars, making him wary of being judged or criticized by others. Despite this, Máté is fiercely independent and determined to make things right in his family's business and personal life. He has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to confront those who wronged him, even if it means facing difficult truths about himself.

**Interests:** Outside of work, Máté enjoys long walks through the countryside, practicing yoga to center himself, and collecting rare books on wine production and history. He is particularly fascinated by the art of winemaking and has a deep respect for the craft, which often informs his approach to problem-solving and decision-making.

While we don't have explicit information about Máté's specific hobbies or interests, it can be inferred from his passion for wine and his desire to learn from others, such as Sophie, that he values personal growth and self-improvement.
