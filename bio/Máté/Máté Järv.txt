Here is a summary of the fictional character Máté Järv:

**Physical Attributes:** Máté stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of physical activity. His bright blue parka and matching hat are a distinctive part of his style, which often contrasts with the somber grey surroundings. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Máté is a complex and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a troubled past as a former detective who became disillusioned with the corruption in Tallinn's government. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need, particularly Helena, with whom he has a deep and intimate connection.

**Interests:** Máté is passionate about justice and uncovering the truth, which drives him to take on high-stakes cases that involve corruption and embezzlement. He also enjoys the outdoors and finds solace in Estonia's rugged landscape, where he can clear his head and reflect on his cases.
