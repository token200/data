Here is a summary of Máté Aslanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Máté Aslanov appears to be introspective and driven. He has a strong desire to uncover the truth about his past and understand his abilities, which suggests that he is curious and determined. His cautious approach when meeting Ariadne also implies that he is guarded or hesitant around new people. However, as the night progresses and he begins to learn from Ariadne, Aslanov seems to open up and trust her, indicating a capacity for growth and adaptation.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - This height suggests that Máté is tall and imposing, which could be intimidating or commanding.
* Eye Color: Brown - The description of Ariadne's piercing green eyes serves as a contrast to Aslanov's own eye color, but it does not explicitly state his eye color. Assuming the same level of detail as the rest of the story, we might infer that Máté has brown eyes.

**Interests:** Máté Aslanov is clearly interested in understanding his past and unlocking the secrets of magic. He is drawn to Ariadne's guidance and is eager to learn about his abilities and the ancient powers that surround him. This suggests that he values knowledge, self-discovery, and possibly a sense of adventure or exploration.
