Here's a summary of Máté Girace's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Máté is a driven and adventurous individual with a strong sense of wanderlust. He is resourceful and determined, having spent years navigating the world's oceans and charting new courses. Despite his love for adventure, he also has a contemplative side, as evident in his feeling of restlessness upon returning to shore. Máté values friendship and camaraderie, particularly with Alessia, whom he considers a confidant.

**Physical Attributes:** Máté is tall, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm), which allows him to move comfortably on deck while navigating the high seas. His hair is dark brown, often worn in a practical style that keeps it out of his face during sailing. His eyes are a deep blue, almost indigo, with piercing gazes that seem to see right through you. He has strong jawlines and sharp cheekbones, giving him an air of ruggedness.

**Interests:** Máté's primary interest is the sea itself – he loves nothing more than charting new courses, exploring hidden coves, and navigating treacherous waters. As a skilled sailor and navigator, he is deeply passionate about the ocean and its secrets. He also has a fascination with cartography, which led him to work closely with Alessia in mapping out new routes and ports.

It's worth noting that Máté seems to be missing something essential to his sense of fulfillment upon returning from his voyages. This could be an indication of a deeper emotional or psychological need, but the story doesn't provide enough information to reveal what exactly is driving this feeling of restlessness in him.
