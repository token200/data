Here is a summary of Máté Bierhals' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Máté appears to be a introspective and emotionally charged individual. As a former revolutionary poet, he likely has a strong sense of social justice and empathy for others. However, it seems that he has channeled his emotions into his art, using it as an outlet to express his feelings about the city and its people. He also has a dry sense of humor, evident in his smoking cigar habit.

**Physical Attributes:** Máté is likely in his mid-to-late 40s or 50s, given his established artistic career and life experiences. His height is not specified, but based on traditional Hungarian attire often worn by men of his age group, he might be around 5'10" to 6'2". His eye color is a deep brown, reflecting his heritage and connection to the land.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Máté has a passion for art, particularly painting. He is deeply inspired by the city's history, culture, and people, often capturing these themes on canvas. His work reflects his own struggles and triumphs, giving it an intimate, personal quality. In addition to art, he enjoys spending time in nature (as seen with his morning walks), smoking cigars, and sharing stories about his life and travels.

Other details that might be inferred:

* Máté likely has a strong connection to the Hungarian culture and history, given his experiences as a young man and his current artwork.
* He is perhaps introverted or reserved, preferring to focus on his art rather than seeking attention from others (his reluctance to share stories about his past war experiences suggests this).
* His studio space in the family bakery above might be small but cozy, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the window.
