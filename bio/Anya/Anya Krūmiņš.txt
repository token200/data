Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Anya Krūmiņš:

**Personality:** Anya appears to be a introspective and nostalgic person. She has a strong sense of belonging and comfort with familiarity, as evident from her ability to feel transported back to better days when walking into the café. Her personality also seems to be shaped by her experiences and relationships, particularly her friendship with Sofia.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are only a few physical attributes mentioned in the story:

* Art and creativity: Sofia mentions her art degree and career as a graphic designer.
* Friendship and relationships: The story highlights the significance of their friendship and how it has provided a sense of belonging.

It's also possible that Anya enjoys:
