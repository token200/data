**Physical Attributes:** Anya is of Swedish descent, with pale skin and striking features. Her height is around 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to move effortlessly through the crowded spaces of her father's antique shop. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that often falls in loose waves down her back, and her eyes are an piercing shade of indigo that seems to hold a deep wisdom.

**Personality:** Anya is a deeply introspective and empathetic individual, with a strong connection to the mystical arts and the natural world. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the conventional norms of her community in pursuit of her own path. Despite this, she possesses a compassionate heart and a desire to help others, making her an ideal medium for those seeking guidance.

**Interests:** Anya's true passion lies in the mystical arts, particularly Swedish folklore and ancient rituals. She spends countless hours studying the incantations, spells, and potions of old, pouring over dusty texts and experimenting with new techniques. Her love of nature is equally strong, as she often takes long walks in the woods or by the sea to connect with the earth and its energies.

However, once you earn her trust, she becomes fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to support and protect those she cares about. She also has a habit of speaking in hushed tones, even when alone, as if the whispers of the wind are always present, urging her on.

**Abilities:** As a medium, Anya possesses a unique ability to communicate with spirits, channeling their words and wisdom into others who seek guidance. Her connection to the natural world allows her to sense subtle vibrations in the earth and perceive the cosmos in ways that most people cannot.
