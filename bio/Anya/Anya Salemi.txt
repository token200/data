Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Anya Salemi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Anya appears to be a strong-willed and introspective individual. She has a tendency to internalize her emotions, as evident in her self-described emotional state of "crumbling from within" after losing loved ones. However, with the arrival of Sophia, she begins to open up and connect with others on a deeper level. This suggests that Anya may have a more vulnerable side beneath her tough exterior.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is only one physical attribute mentioned in the story: Anya's eyes are not specified. However, we can infer some characteristics based on her behavior and reactions to the environment. She seems to be someone who pays attention to details, as she notices Sophia from afar, and her presence in the crowded caf√© is highlighted.

As for height, no specific information is provided, but given that Anya's eyes are not mentioned, it is possible that they do not play a significant role in defining her physical appearance. Similarly, there is no mention of her hair color or style, skin tone, or facial features beyond her eyes.

**Interests:** Based on the story, we can infer some aspects of Anya's interests:

1. **Emotional expression and connection**: After losing loved ones, Anya struggles to express her emotions and connect with others. However, when Sophia arrives, she begins to open up and form a deep bond.
2. **Self-reflection and introspection**: Anya's thoughts are dominated by memories of past arguments, heartbreaks, and regrets, suggesting that she is someone who reflects on their experiences and emotions.
3. **Supporting others**: As the strong rock for those around her, Anya has a natural inclination to support and connect with others.

While these interests can be inferred from the story, more context would be needed to fully flesh out any additional aspects of Anya's personality or behavior.
