**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: Approximately 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Vibrant green eyes with hints of hazel
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a subtle bob that frames her face

**Personality:**
Sami is characterized by her boundless curiosity and passion for literature. She exudes an air of quiet confidence, moving with a fluidity that hints at an inner world of introspection. Her green eyes sparkle with intelligence, conveying a sense of depth and thoughtfulness. Sami's connection to her father's legacy drives her to explore the realms of philosophy, metaphysics, and storytelling.

**Interests:**
- Literature: Sami is deeply drawn to the works of her father, Jorge Luis Borges, as well as other influential thinkers in existentialism and philosophical fiction.
- Philosophy: She explores the ideas of time, space, identity, and belonging in her own writing and discussions with others.

Given that she claims to be Jorge Luis Borges' daughter but shares no clear information about her life before her supposed connection with Carlos, it remains uncertain whether Sami truly has familial ties to the famous author. Nonetheless, there is an undeniable kinship between them—both in spirit and passion—for exploring and unraveling the complex tapestry of human thought and imagination.
