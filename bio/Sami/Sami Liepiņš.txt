Based on the short story provided as inspiration, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Sami Liepiņš:

**Personality:** Sami is a introspective and emotional person who has struggled to find purpose and belonging in his life. He is haunted by past regrets and failures, but still holds onto hope and a desire to create music again. Despite feeling worn down by time and experience, he remains fiercely passionate about his craft and is willing to take risks to revive the spark within him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: A deep, soulful brown that seems to hold a world of emotions
* Hair: Dark brown and unkempt, with hints of gray at the temples, reflecting his age and maturity

**Interests:** Music is Sami's lifeblood. He has always been drawn to blues and rock 'n' roll, finding solace in their raw emotion and energy. As a young man, he spent countless hours playing guitar on the streets, chasing the rush of adrenaline from performing live. Even now, as an older man, music remains his escape, his passion, and his purpose. He is also deeply connected to the city of Riga, Latvia, where his journey began, and finds inspiration in its weathered, worn beauty.

It's worth noting that some details about Sami's physical appearance are not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I've made some educated guesses based on the narrative.
