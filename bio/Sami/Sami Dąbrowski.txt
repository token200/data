**Interests:** Writing is Sami's primary passion. She has always found solace in putting words on paper, whether it's poetry, short stories, or journal entries. She enjoys losing herself in the world of words, where she can explore complex emotions and ideas without fear of judgment. Her love of writing also extends to her fascination with literature and linguistics.

Beyond writing, Sami is a curious and introspective person who finds joy in observing the world around her. She appreciates the quiet beauty of rainy days, which seem to inspire her creativity.

As she navigates her journey towards self-discovery, Sami's interests also include music (she has a soft spot for indie folk and piano-driven melodies) and art (she enjoys sketching and painting in her spare time). However, writing remains her primary source of comfort and creative expression.
