* Hair: Sami's hair is a wild tangle of curly brown locks that often falls down her back like a waterfall.
* Skin Tone: She has a pale, almost translucent complexion with a subtle sheen, as if her skin is infused with the soft glow of candlelight.

**Interests:** As an artist, Sami Durchdenwald is deeply interested in capturing the essence of nature and the world around her. Her art studio is filled with various natural materials, such as leaves, twigs, and seeds, which she incorporates into her paintings.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Sami seems to have a deep connection to the moon and the night sky, often incorporating lunar themes and symbolism into her work. Her interest in these mystical realms may be reflected in her reclusive nature, which allows her to tap into the magic of the world without distractions.
