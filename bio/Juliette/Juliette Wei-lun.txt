**Personality:** Juliette (or Zero Cool) is a brilliant, reclusive hacker with a strong sense of justice. Despite her fearsome reputation, she is not malicious; rather, she uses her exceptional skills to fight for social justice, exposing corruption and inequality in corporations and governments around the world. She has a curious and adventurous spirit, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to use her talents for good.

**Physical Attributes:** Juliette (or Zero Cool) is likely an Asian woman, possibly Chinese or Taiwanese-American, given the pseudonym "Wei-lun" which suggests a East Asian origin. However, no definitive details are provided in the story. Assuming she is of average height, around 5'6" to 5'8", with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair (which Echo has) that may be Juliette's natural hair color.

**Interests:** As a brilliant hacker, Juliette has an intense interest in computer systems, networking, and cybersecurity. She is highly skilled in these areas, using her talents to infiltrate even the most secure systems. Her interests extend beyond hacking; she is also passionate about social justice, human rights, and exposing corruption. In her free time (which is rare for someone with her skill level), Juliette may enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, or science, as well as practicing martial arts or yoga to maintain physical fitness.
