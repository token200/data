Here is a summary of Juliette Lefevre's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Juliette appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. She is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about the Society and their motivations, and she is willing to take risks to protect her knowledge and those around her. Her fear of being hunted by the Order is palpable, but it has also made her resilient and cautious. She seems to have a strong sense of justice and is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Physical Attributes:** Juliette's physical attributes are not fully described in the short story, so I will make some assumptions based on the context:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or hazel

**Interests:** Juliette is clearly passionate about uncovering the truth and fighting against those who would seek to harm her or others. Her interests appear to be focused on research, investigation, and resistance. She is likely interested in history, archaeology, and the occult, given her focus on ancient artifacts and the Society's connections to them.

It's worth noting that Juliette's character is inspired by the character of Juliette Lefevre from "The Mortal Instruments" series by Cassandra Clare, which may have influenced my summary. However, I've tried to tailor the details to fit the context of your short story.
