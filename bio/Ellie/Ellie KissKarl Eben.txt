Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that often falls in loose waves down her back, while her bright green eyes sparkle with curiosity and a hint of mischief. She has a small tattoo of a magnifying glass on her left wrist, a token from her detective upbringing.

**Personality:**
Ellie is a free-spirited adventurer with a passion for solving mysteries and uncovering hidden secrets. Her quick wit, sharp instincts, and resourceful nature make her a formidable opponent in any puzzle or challenge she faces. With a healthy dose of sarcasm and humor, Ellie can often diffuse tense situations with a well-timed quip.

**Interests:**
Ellie's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting her passion for discovery and problem-solving. She is an avid collector of rare books and artifacts, with a particular fascination for ancient myths and legends.

**Additional Details:**
Ellie's family background has shaped her interests and motivations. Her parents, renowned detectives in their own right, have taught her everything they know about investigation and analysis. However, Ellie's desire for independence and individuality often puts her at odds with their expectations.
