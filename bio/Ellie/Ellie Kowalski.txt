Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Ellie Kowalski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ellie is a complex and emotionally charged individual. She has a deep sense of responsibility towards her father, despite their tumultuous relationship, which suggests that she is a caring and empathetic person. However, the weight of this responsibility also contributes to her emotional turmoil, making her a multi-dimensional character with a mix of sadness, anger, and fear. Ellie appears to be strong-willed and determined, as evidenced by her decision to face her father despite her reservations.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no explicit physical attributes are mentioned in the story. However, based on the character's emotional state and personality, I can make some educated guesses:

* Age: Late 20s to early 30s
* Height: Average to slightly above-average height (around 5'8" to 6'0")
* Eye Color: Green or hazel, which could complement her emotional depth

**Interests:** While the story doesn't explicitly state Ellie's interests, we can infer some based on her character:

* Emotional introspection and self-reflection: Ellie spends a lot of time processing her emotions and trying to make sense of her relationship with her father. This suggests that she values self-awareness and personal growth.
* Loyalty and friendship: Her strong bond with Rachel implies that Ellie is someone who values close relationships and prioritizes loyalty.
* Forgiveness and reconciliation: Ellie's decision to face her father and potentially work towards closure and forgiveness indicates that she may be interested in personal healing, redemption, and moving forward.

These inferences provide a glimpse into Ellie's personality, physical attributes, and interests, which can help flesh out this fictional character.
