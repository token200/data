Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Ellie Trevisan:

**Personality:** Ellie Trevisan appears to be an creative and introspective individual. She is passionate about her art, but struggles with self-doubt and feeling lost in her passion for painting. She values honesty and vulnerability, as evident in her conversation with her friend Lily, where she opens up about her fears and doubts. Despite this, Ellie has a resilient and determined spirit, shown by her willingness to take a step back, breathe, and return to her art with renewed enthusiasm.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue-green (a unique shade that sets her apart)

While the story doesn't provide detailed physical descriptions of Ellie's body type or facial features, it does give a sense of her overall appearance through her "tangled hair". Her height is likely average to slightly above-average, and her eye color is distinctive enough to be notable.

**Interests:** Ellie's primary interest is art, specifically painting and sculpting. She finds solace in the urban landscape of New York City and has a deep passion for capturing its energy and chaos on canvas. Her interests also include spending time alone with her thoughts and exploring her creativity, as evident from her late-night sessions with paint-stained canvases.

Other interests may not be explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that Ellie values introspection, self-expression, and connection with nature, given her affinity for the urban landscape and her appreciation for Lily's advice to "breathe again".
