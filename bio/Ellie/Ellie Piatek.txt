Here is a summary of Ellie Piatek's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ellie Piatek is a kind, intelligent, and charismatic individual who exudes confidence. She has a strong passion for collecting and dealing with vintage items, but this drives her personal life largely under the radar. Those who know her speak highly of her unwavering dedication to her craft and her ability to connect people through the stories behind her artifacts.

**Physical Attributes:** Ellie is described as having "confidence and charm," suggesting she is attractive, poised, and engaging. Unfortunately, no specific details about her physical appearance are given in the story, including her height or eye color.

However, I can make some educated guesses based on the context of the story:

* Height: Based on the narrative, Ellie appears to be someone who moves with ease and confidence, which suggests she is likely above average height. Perhaps 5'8" to 6'0" would be a plausible estimate.
* Eye Color: Given her warm and engaging demeanor, I imagine her eyes are bright and expressive. Hazel or green eyes might suit her personality and charm.

**Interests:** Ellie's passion for collecting and dealing with vintage items is evident throughout the story. Her love of the unusual and rare drives her to seek out unique trinkets and artifacts, which she carefully curates and shares with others.
