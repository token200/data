Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Ellie Ozols:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Age: Late 20s
- Height: 5'8"
- Eye Color: Hazel with golden undertones (reflecting her heritage and connection to nature)
- Hair Color: Dark Brown with subtle hints of auburn, reminiscent of the wildflowers that once bloomed in the fields.
- Skin Tone: Warm, sun-kissed complexion with a scattering of freckles across her nose.

**Personality:**
Ellie is an introspective and emotional individual, carrying a deep sense of nostalgia and longing. She struggles to connect with those around her due to her mother's cold demeanor, making it challenging for her to form meaningful relationships. Despite this, Ellie possesses a strong sense of determination and resilience, evident in her willingness to explore the farm and confront her emotions.

**Interests:**
- Nature and outdoor activities (hiking, stargazing)
- Creative pursuits (writing, painting, photography)
- Genealogy and learning about her family's history
- Understanding her mother's behavior and emotional state

Ellie's interests are rooted in her love for nature, which she shares with her grandfather, Janis. Her desire to learn more about her family's past and connect with those around her stems from a longing for understanding and acceptance.

**Additional Details:**
Ellie has a quiet strength and introspection that allows her to navigate complex emotional situations. She may have artistic or creative outlets as a way to express herself, perhaps through writing poetry or painting landscapes inspired by the natural world. Her relationship with nature is deeply personal and therapeutic, offering solace in times of turmoil.

Keep in mind that these details are based on the inspiration provided by the short story and can be expanded upon as needed.
