Here is a summary of Olivia Navratilova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olivia is a confident and determined individual who is unafraid to speak her mind. She is an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and uses her platform to raise awareness and support for the community. Despite her boldness, she exudes a sense of calm and composure on the tennis court, which serves her well in high-pressure situations.

**Physical Attributes:** Olivia stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with long, dark brown hair and bright blue eyes that seem to sparkle with determination. Her athletic build and toned physique are testament to her dedication to training and fitness.

**Interests:** In addition to tennis, Olivia is passionate about social justice and advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. She is also a strong supporter of women's rights and empowerment. Off the court, she enjoys spending time with her family and friends, and is an avid reader and traveler. Her love of adventure and excitement extends to her approach to the sport of tennis itself, where she is always seeking new challenges and ways to improve her game.

It's worth noting that I made some assumptions about Olivia's physical attributes (such as eye color) and interests (such as reading and traveling), since they were not explicitly mentioned in the original text. However, these details are consistent with a fictional character who is described as bold, determined, and passionate about social justice and tennis.
