It's worth noting that some details were left out of the original text, so I've made some educated guesses based on the context. For example, Olivia's height is estimated to be 5'8" based on her being a petite woman with a slender build, but this could be adjusted if needed. Similarly, I assumed that she has dark brown hair and hazel eyes, but these can also be changed if preferred.
