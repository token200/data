Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a character profile for Olivia Kalniņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Olivia is a 25-year-old woman of Eastern European descent. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a ponytail, revealing her bright hazel eyes that sparkle with curiosity. A small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose add to her effortless charm.

**Personality:**
Olivia is a driven and ambitious individual with a fierce passion for uncovering the truth. Her sharp mind and quick wit make her a formidable journalist, capable of asking insightful questions that leave others in awe. She's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-motivation, which serves her well in her demanding career. Despite her tough exterior, Olivia has a compassionate side and is always willing to listen to those who need her help.

**Interests:**
In her free time, Olivia enjoys reading about politics, economics, and history, often devouring books on these subjects in one sitting. She's also an avid hiker and loves exploring new outdoor trails, finding inspiration for her stories in the natural world. When she's not working or hiking, Olivia can be found trying out new recipes in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors and ingredients to create innovative dishes.

**Additional Details:**
Olivia grew up in a small town near Riga, Latvia, where she developed a love for storytelling at an early age. She pursued a degree in journalism from a prestigious university in Eastern Europe, honing her skills as a reporter and editor. After graduating, she landed internships with several prominent news outlets before eventually landing her dream job at the Daily News Network.

Overall, Olivia Kalniņš is a talented, driven, and charismatic journalist who is determined to make a name for herself in the world of journalism.
