I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Marcos Alighieri. However, I can create a new character based on your request.

Meet Alessandro Alighieri (not Marcos), a fictionalized version of a poet inspired by Dante Alighieri:

Physical Attributes:
Alessandro Alighieri stands at 5'10" with an athletic build. His dark brown hair is often tousled, and his piercing green eyes sparkle with creativity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

Personality:
Alessandro is a romantic at heart, with a passion for poetry that rivals Dante's own love for it. He is kind, compassionate, and always willing to lend an ear to those in need. His dry sense of humor often catches people off guard, but once you get to know him, he reveals a deep empathy and understanding.

Interests:
Alessandro loves nothing more than exploring the winding streets of Florence, just as Dante did. He is particularly fond of the city's hidden gems, like secret gardens and ancient churches. Music also plays a significant role in his life; he often strums his guitar or recites poetry to accompany it. His favorite poet? None other than Dante Alighieri himself.

Additional Details:
Alessandro has a weakness for traditional Italian cuisine, especially ribollita and pappardelle. He is an avid reader of philosophy and literature, devouring books on everything from Plato to Shakespeare. When he's not writing or teaching, Alessandro can be found wandering the banks of the Arno River, lost in thought.

While Alessandro may share some characteristics with Dante Alighieri, he is a unique individual with his own story to tell.
