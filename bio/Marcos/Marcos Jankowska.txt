Here's a summary of Marcos Jankowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marcos is a driven and ambitious individual with a passion for uncovering the truth. His years of experience as a freelance journalist have made him tough and resourceful, but also somewhat cynical about people's intentions. Despite this, he has a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to expose secrets and lies in the art world. He can come across as confident and assertive when investigating leads, but beneath that exterior lies a vulnerable side that yearns for connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Marcos stands at 6'2" with an athletic build, which allows him to navigate the crowded streets of New York City with ease. His hair is dark brown and often messy, while his eyes are a deep, piercing blue (as opposed to green, as mentioned in the story). He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, hinting at a more adventurous past.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Marcos is drawn to the art world's intricate web of scandals, forgery, and hidden histories. He is particularly fascinated by the works of Pablo Picasso and other influential artists. His childhood in Warsaw and subsequent training at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts have instilled in him a deep appreciation for art as a means of self-expression and social commentary.

Outside of his professional life, Marcos enjoys smoking cigarettes (as depicted in the story), sipping whiskey on a cold evening, or exploring the city's hidden corners. He is not afraid to take risks or challenge authority when pursuing a lead, but he also has a deep respect for the art world's power and influence.

Overall, Marcos Jankowska is a complex character driven by his passion for truth-telling and his desire to uncover the secrets of the art world.
