Here is a summary of Marcos de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marcos de' Medici is a creative and introspective individual who finds solace in his writing. He is driven by a passion for poetry and storytelling, which serves as a refuge from the pressures of his family's expectations and duties as a Medici. Despite being expected to excel in politics and diplomacy, Marcos is more comfortable expressing himself through words than navigating the complexities of statecraft. This ambivalence can lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, but his love for writing provides him with a sense of purpose and creative freedom.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Deep brown, almost black
- **Hair Color:** Dark chestnut, often worn long and unkempt
- **Build:** Slender and athletic, reflecting his fondness for outdoor activities
- **Facial Features:** Strong jawline, prominent nose, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (resulting from a childhood accident)

**Interests:** 
- Writing: Poetry, short stories, and epic tales that explore themes of love, loss, and human nature.
- Music: Marcos is a skilled lutenist and often finds inspiration in the melodies and rhythms of classical music.
- Nature: As an outdoorsy person, he appreciates long walks in the Tuscan countryside and enjoys observing the beauty of the natural world.
- Family: His relationships with his family members are complex, but Marcos holds a special affection for his daughter, Beatrice, who shares his love for literature and poetry.
