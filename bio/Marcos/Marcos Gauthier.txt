**Personality:** Marcos is a ruggedly confident individual with a sharp mind and quick wit. He has a natural air of authority that commands respect, but beneath his tough exterior lies a complex web of experiences and emotions that drive him to uncover the truth. His years in the French military have given him a strong sense of discipline and responsibility, but they've also left scars and a lingering desire for justice.

As a private investigator, Marcos has developed a sharp analytical mind and a keen instinct for deception, allowing him to navigate the city's underbelly with ease. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries in pursuit of the truth.

Despite his tough exterior, Marcos has a soft spot for those who have been wronged or marginalized, particularly women and children. This empathy drives him to take on cases that might otherwise go unexplored, including the recent missing person's investigation.

Marcos is also drawn to music, with a fondness for the works of French composer Claude Debussy, whose complex and enigmatic compositions likely resonate with his own personality.

Outside of work, Marc might enjoy spending time in quiet cafes, reading books on history or philosophy, and taking long walks along the Seine River.
