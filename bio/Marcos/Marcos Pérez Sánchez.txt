Based on the fictional character Marcos Pérez Sánchez, here's some background information:

**Personality:**
Marcos is a charming and resourceful individual with a quick wit and a dry sense of humor. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, but has a hard time opening up to new people due to past experiences. Despite this, he is always willing to help others and will go to great lengths to protect his loved ones.

**Physical Attributes:**
Marcos stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of working as a parkour instructor. His hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy, piecey fashion. His eyes are a deep shade of hazel that seem to change color depending on the lighting. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:**
Marcos is passionate about urban exploration and parkour, having spent years honing his skills as an instructor at a local gym. He also enjoys photography and music, often capturing images of the city's hidden gems and playing guitar in his free time.

As for the world he inhabits, let's say Marcos lives in a modern-day urban setting with a mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. The city is called Azura, a metropolis built on an ancient mythological site where magic and technology coexist.

**Themes:**
The story could explore themes of identity, loyalty, and the blurred lines between reality and mythology. Marcos' past experiences have left him wary of getting close to others, but as he navigates the complexities of Azura's hidden world, he begins to confront his demons and open up to new people.
