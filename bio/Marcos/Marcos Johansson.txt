As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of darkness and despair, but he remains resolute in his pursuit of truth. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, willing to take risks and challenge the status quo to uncover the truth.

However, this could be a facade, hiding a more complex personality beneath the surface. His drive for justice may stem from a personal tragedy or loss in his past, fueling his determination to uncover the truth and make a difference.

It's also worth noting that Marcos has an affinity for cigarettes, as hinted at in the story when he lights up a cigarette before heading to Caf√© Els Quatre Gats. This could be a coping mechanism or a habit, possibly related to stress or nervousness.
