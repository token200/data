Marcos is a driven and passionate individual, always fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the past. He has a contagious enthusiasm for his work and is never satisfied with just scratching the surface of a mystery. His years of experience have honed his expertise, but also left him with a sense of humility, knowing that there's still so much to learn.

Marcos is fiercely intelligent and can hold long, animated discussions about history, mythology, or archaeology.

His areas of expertise include Maya, Aztec, and Inca history, with a particular focus on mythological and cosmological themes.

When he's not deep in the jungle or analyzing artifacts, Marcos enjoys sharing his knowledge with others, whether through public lectures, workshops, or casual conversations over a pint of cerveza. He's particularly interested in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ancient cultures, often collaborating with historians, anthropologists, and physicists to shed new light on long-standing enigmas.

In his free time, Marcos is an avid hiker and nature lover, always seeking out new landscapes to explore and discover hidden treasures (both literal and metaphorical). He has a soft spot for Brazilian music, particularly samba, which often provides the perfect accompaniment to his thoughts while he's planning his next expedition.
