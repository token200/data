**Personality:** Andreas is an introverted and perceptive individual who has struggled to find his place in various communities. He is sensitive to the whispers of others, picking up on subtle cues that others miss, which makes him both observant and empathetic. However, this sensitivity also makes him feel like an outsider and vulnerable to being judged or accused. As he finds himself drawn to the young woman, Andreas begins to realize that he may not be a ghost after all, but rather someone who is finally finding a sense of belonging.

**Physical Attributes:** Andreas has dark hair, piercing green eyes, and a lean build. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm), which makes him slightly above average height for his build. His features are angular and refined, giving him an otherworldly appearance that is fitting for someone who feels like an outsider.

**Interests:** Andreas seems to be drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, as he finds himself exploring a new town in search of refuge from his past. He is also fascinated by people-watching and observing human behavior, which suggests that he is curious and analytical. His ability to pick up on subtle cues also indicates that he has strong observational skills and may be interested in psychology or sociology.

In terms of specific interests, Andreas appears to enjoy reading, as he notices a young woman sitting alone with a book at the tavern. He may also have an interest in learning about the local history and culture of the town, given his desire to find a sense of belonging and connection with its people.
