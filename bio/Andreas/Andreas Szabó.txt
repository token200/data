Here is a summary of the fictional character Andreas Szabó:

**Physical Attributes:** Andreas Szabó stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to sparkle with curiosity and enthusiasm whenever he's discussing his passions. He has short, dark hair that's often messy and unkempt, giving him a relaxed, laid-back appearance.

**Personality:** Andreas is a practical and responsible individual who values stability and security above all else. However, this doesn't mean he lacks adventure or a sense of wanderlust – he simply prioritizes caution and planning over spontaneity and risk-taking. He's fiercely loyal to his friends and family, particularly László, whom he considers his partner in crime. Andreas is also deeply introspective and has a dry sense of humor that he often uses to deflect from his true feelings.

**Interests:** Despite his cautious nature, Andreas has a wide range of interests and hobbies that reflect his love of learning and exploration. He's an avid reader of history books, particularly those about the Roman Empire and Eastern European politics. In his free time, he enjoys practicing martial arts (karate, to be specific) and playing chess – both activities that help him cultivate strategic thinking and focus. Andreas is also passionate about photography and loves capturing the beauty of Budapest's architecture and landscapes.

**Background:** Growing up in Szeged, Hungary, Andreas was raised by a close-knit community of family and friends who encouraged his love of learning and exploration. He spent many hours exploring the local countryside with László, dreaming of adventure beyond their tiny corner of Europe. After completing his engineering degree, Andreas settled into a comfortable but unfulfilling routine as an accountant in Budapest – until László's visit reignited his sense of wanderlust and possibility.
