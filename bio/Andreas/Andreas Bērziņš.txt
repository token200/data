He has piercing brown eyes that seem to hold a deep understanding of the universe. His eye color is likely a combination of earthy tones with a hint of golden warmth, reflecting his connection to the celestial bodies he studies.

Andreas Bērziņš is a deeply introspective and contemplative individual, often lost in thought as he ponders the mysteries of the universe. His fascination with the unknown has shaped him into a wise and enigmatic person who seems to possess an otherworldly intensity. He exudes an air of quiet confidence, as if he has unlocked secrets that others have yet to discover.

Despite his renowned status among scholars, Andreas appears humble and unassuming, often preferring the solitude of his dimly lit room to the company of others. His ability to listen to the whispers of the cosmos has made him a guardian of ancient knowledge, and those who spend time with him are drawn into his realm of cosmic wonder.

Andreas's primary interest lies in the field of 'star whispering', an obscure branch of astronomy that seeks to understand the hidden patterns governing the universe. He is deeply passionate about deciphering the secrets of celestial bodies, and his dedication has earned him a reputation as a leading expert in this area.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Andreas is drawn to the mystical and symbolic aspects of various cultures and traditions. His love for ancient texts and trinkets suggests that he values knowledge as a physical artifact, one that can connect him to the mysteries of the universe on a deeper level.

The incantation passed down through his family adds another layer of depth to Andreas's interests, indicating that he is not only a scholar but also a spiritual seeker. His recitation of the incantation under the full moon suggests a deep reverence for the celestial bodies and an ability to tap into their mystical power.
