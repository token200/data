Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Andres Koskinen:

**Personality:** Andres Koskinen is a man of mystery with an air of intrigue that follows him everywhere. He has a keen mind and an even keener eye for detail, which enables him to solve complex cases. He is resourceful and determined, as evident from his willingness to take on the case of Sophia's missing grandmother despite the urgency and uncertainty surrounding it.

**Physical Attributes:** Andres Koskinen is of average height, approximately 5'9" (175 cm), with a fit and slender build. His eye color is described in the story as not being specified, but based on Finnish heritage, we can assume he has blue or green eyes. There is no mention of his hair color or style.

**Interests:** Andres Koskinen seems to have an interest in baking, as Sophia's promise of "all the clotted cream and cardamom cookies" motivates him to take on the case. This could suggest that Andres has a soft spot for baked goods or may even be an amateur baker himself. Additionally, his work as a detective suggests that he values precision, attention to detail, and solving mysteries, which are all integral parts of his profession.

It's worth noting that some details about Andres' physical appearance, such as his height, eye color, and hair style, are not explicitly mentioned in the original story. Therefore, I've made assumptions based on general characteristics associated with Finnish people and common traits among detectives.
