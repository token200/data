Her determination and excitement are palpable when she decides to write about Akira's people and history.

**Physical Attributes:**

**Interests:** As a freelance writer, Saltanat is naturally drawn to stories of adventure and courage. She is also passionate about learning about different cultures and histories, and is particularly interested in sharing the stories of indigenous communities. Her experience on the frozen tundra of Lapland has sparked a new sense of purpose and direction, as she wants to use her writing skills to bring attention to the struggles of these communities.
