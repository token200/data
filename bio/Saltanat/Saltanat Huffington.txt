**Personality:** Saltanat Huffington was a brilliant and adventurous soul with a strong sense of determination and intellect.

As she grew older, she became increasingly restless and sought to challenge traditional norms and limitations.

**Physical Attributes:** Saltanat was tall for a woman of her time, standing at around 5'8" (173 cm).

Her dark hair was long and flowing, often tied back in a practical ponytail beneath her leather helmet.

**Interests:** Saltanat had a deep passion for learning and discovery, particularly when it came to astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. She was fascinated by the workings of the universe and spent countless hours studying the stars and predicting celestial events. Her love of archery and horseback riding remained strong, but she found that these skills were no longer enough for her - she craved something more intellectually stimulating.

In addition to her scientific interests, Saltanat was also deeply interested in the potential of advanced irrigation systems to transform communities and bring prosperity to the people. She spent many hours studying the ancient text and researching ways to implement its principles on a larger scale.
