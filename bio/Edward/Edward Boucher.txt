Here is a summary of Edward Boucher's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Edward Boucher is an enigmatic figure with a complex web of emotions. He is known for his wit and charm, but also has a dry sense of humor that can be off-putting to those who don't know him. Despite this, he is fiercely intelligent and determined, making him one of the most accomplished detectives in the city. However, his obsession with cases like Richard Langley's has taken a toll on him, leaving him feeling isolated and haunted by shadows.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Sandy blond, often neatly combed to the side of his face
* Build: Lean, athletic build from years of playing sports as a child

**Interests:** Edward Boucher is an avid reader and collector of rare books. He has a particular fascination with philosophy, psychology, and sociology, which he finds informs much of his approach to detective work. When not solving cases, he enjoys long walks in the rain (much like the one that first led him to Richard Langley's mystery), playing chess, and listening to jazz music.

Outside of these interests, Edward Boucher is a bit of an introvert, preferring the company of shadows and silence over that of loud crowds or boisterous conversations. His quiet nature can sometimes be mistaken for aloofness, but those who know him well understand his deep passion for justice and his willingness to risk everything to uncover the truth.

Despite his tough exterior, Edward Boucher has a deep sense of empathy and compassion, which drives his determination to solve cases like Richard Langley's. His emotional scars may have left their mark on him, but they also fuel his resolve to bring justice to those who have been wronged.
