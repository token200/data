He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to take on cases that others might overlook. His quiet confidence and sharp instincts have earned him a reputation as one of the best private investigators in the business.

He also has a passion for collecting rare and unusual artifacts, which often inspire new leads and insights into his cases. Outside of work, Edward enjoys long walks on rainy days (much like the one described in the short story) and spends hours pouring over files and notes to unravel the puzzles that have become so familiar to him.

Despite his tough exterior, Edward Deschamps has a dry sense of humor and an appreciation for the darker corners of human nature. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them, often putting himself in harm's way to uncover the truth.
