Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Edward Roberts' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Edward is described as having a passion for restoration work, which suggests he is driven, meticulous, and detail-oriented. He is also portrayed as being brave and determined, willing to tackle a project despite the whispers of dark past and potential supernatural occurrences. However, his rational nature (not believing in ghost stories or superstitions) suggests that he may also be open-minded and curious.

Physical Attributes: Unfortunately, no physical attributes are explicitly mentioned in the story, except for one detail - Edward is skilled as a carpenter. It can be inferred that he has strong hands, good hand-eye coordination, and possibly other physical attributes beneficial to his trade. Without any height or eye color information provided in the text, I will make an assumption.

Height: Let's assume Edward stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), which would allow him to move comfortably between different levels of a historic mansion while still allowing for room for gestures and postures that reveal his passion and personality.

Eye Color: Assuming Edward is human, it's likely he has brown or blue eyes - as these are common eye colors in many Caucasian populations.
