**Personality:** Edward is a introspective and reserved individual, who has been carrying around emotional scars from his past.

However, with Sofia by his side, he begins to open up and reveal his true self, showing a more vulnerable and hopeful side.

**Physical Attributes:** Edward is tall, though no specific height is mentioned, but based on the context of him standing at the edge of the frozen lake, it can be inferred that he has an above-average height.

**Interests:** Edward's primary interest is woodworking, which he learned from his father and honed into a precision skill over time. He finds solace and comfort in the workshop, using it to escape the loneliness of his life. However, with Sofia by his side, his interests expand to include conversation topics such as literature, further revealing a more well-rounded individual.
