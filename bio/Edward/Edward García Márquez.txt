**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)

* Despite his introverted nature, he has a rich inner life and is not afraid to explore the depths of human emotion. He's deeply empathetic and can connect with others on a profound level.
* Edward is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. However, this independence comes at a cost – he can be intensely moody and struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation.

**Quirks:**

* Edward has a habit of talking to himself when he's writing or deep in thought. His friends and family have learned to humor him on these occasions.
* He's a bit of a coffee snob and can often be found sipping strong, rich brews throughout the day.
