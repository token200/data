However, beneath this charming exterior lies a complex individual with a rich inner life. He's an outsider-turned-insider who has struggled to find his place in the world.

As a mentor and confidant to those who need it most, Edward Petrenko's greatest reward comes from connecting with others who feel like they don't quite fit in.
