Based on the life and works of Jorge Luis Borges, I'll create a fictional character profile for Edward Luis Borges:

**Name:** Edward Luis Borges
**Birthdate:** August 24, 1899 (same as his real-life counterpart)
**Place of Birth:** Buenos Aires, Argentina
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm) - slightly above average height for an Argentine male during that era.
**Eye Color:** Dark Brown - a trait commonly associated with the Argentine population.

**Personality:**
Edward Luis Borges is a complex and introspective individual, inheriting his real-life counterpart's love of language and intellectual curiosity. He is a naturally curious person, always seeking to explore new ideas and perspectives. Edward's wit and humor are renowned among friends and family, making him a charming conversationalist.

However, beneath his affable exterior lies a deep-seated passion for philosophical inquiry and metaphysical exploration. He is intensely critical of conventional thinking and is not afraid to challenge established norms. This intellectual ferocity can sometimes make him appear aloof or detached to those who don't know him well.

**Interests:**
Edward Luis Borges has a wide range of interests, including:
1. Reading and writing (fiction and non-fiction)
2. Philosophy ( particularly metaphysics and epistemology)
3. Language and linguistics
4. Chess - an intellectual pursuit he shares with his fictional counterpart.
5. Music (he's an avid fan of Argentine tango and classical music)

Edward Luis Borges is a true polymath, constantly seeking to expand his knowledge and understanding of the world around him. His insatiable curiosity drives him to explore new ideas, challenge existing assumptions, and push the boundaries of human thought.

While I've drawn inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' life and works, please note that Edward Luis Borges is an entirely fictional character, with no direct connection to his real-life counterpart.
