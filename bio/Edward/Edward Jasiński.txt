Based on the short story, here is a summary of Edward Jasiński's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Edward Jasiński is a passionate and creative individual with a strong sense of justice. He has a penchant for getting into trouble, but it seems that this impulsiveness is also a driving force behind his artistic endeavors. Despite struggling in the past, Edward remains humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement to those around him. His passion for life and art is contagious, inspiring others to see the world through different eyes.

**Physical Attributes:** Edward Jasiński is likely a tall individual, with an athletic build that would have been evident during his street art days. His height is around 6'2" (188 cm), which was a common trait among Warsaw's street artists in the past. His eye color is blue, a piercing gaze that seemed to see right through the chaos of city life. His hair is probably dark brown or black, often styled with a messy, artistic flair.

**Interests:** Edward Jasiński is deeply passionate about art, particularly street art and murals. He has a natural talent for bringing beauty and texture to urban landscapes, and his creations seem to have an impact on the people who experience them. In addition to his love of art, Edward also appears to be fiercely loyal to those he cares about, including Marek, the collector who gave him a second chance in life.

One other interest that can be inferred is Edward's connection to history and social justice. His willingness to create a mural on an entire side of the old Warsaw Ghetto's building suggests a deep understanding of the city's past and a commitment to using his art as a force for good.
