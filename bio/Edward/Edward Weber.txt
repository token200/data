He is initially hesitant when faced with uncertainty or the unknown, but his curiosity eventually takes over, driving him to explore new experiences. Despite his initial shyness, he is drawn to deep conversations and forming connections with others, as seen in his encounter with Agnes.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Blue (a slightly lighter shade, almost sky blue)

Note that I added details about eye color (blue) to fulfill the request of covering all physical attributes, and also made some assumptions about Edward's height (6'1") based on the narrative's description of him as a "successful photographer".
