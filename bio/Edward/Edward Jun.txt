**Physical Attributes:**
Edward Jun stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost black, which seems to bore into those he meets. His hair is a dark brown color that often falls across his forehead in messy, artistic style. He has a small nose and full lips, giving him a gentle and introspective appearance.

**Personality:**
Edward Jun is a quiet, reserved individual with an intense passion for art. Despite his reclusive nature, he is a deeply creative person who pours his heart and soul into his work. He is intelligent, analytical, and thoughtful, often lost in his own thoughts as he navigates the world of art. Edward has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or distant to those who don't know him, but this is only a fa√ßade that hides a deep well of emotions and empathy.

**Interests:**
Edward Jun's primary interest lies in his art, with an overwhelming focus on exploring the world of colors, textures, and patterns. He finds beauty in even the smallest details and believes that it's his job to capture these moments on canvas. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Edward is also drawn to philosophical ideas and theories that explore the nature of reality and the human condition. Sophia, his close friend and confidante, has observed that Edward has a deep appreciation for literature, music, and poetry, which all serve as inspiration for his art.

**Other Quirks:**
Edward Jun is known to be an early riser, often waking up at dawn to meditate and collect his thoughts before starting his day. He is fiercely self-motivated and disciplined, requiring alone time in his studio to tap into his creative potential. Despite his reclusive nature, Edward has a deep connection with the world around him, often finding solace in the quiet moments of contemplation.

Overall, Edward Jun is a complex, multifaceted individual with a rich inner life that informs every aspect of his art and personal relationships.
