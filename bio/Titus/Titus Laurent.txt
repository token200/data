**Physical Attributes:** Titus is a tall and slender figure, likely in his mid-to-late 30s. His exact height is not specified, but he has an air of elegance about him that belies his dark past. His eyes are like two dark pools of water, drawing those around him in with their intensity. His hair is unkempt and dark, framing a face that is both sharp-jawed and finely featured.

**Personality:** Titus is a complex and enigmatic individual, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. He exudes an air of confidence and authority, but also an underlying sense of vulnerability and introspection. He appears to be driven by a desire for knowledge and power, yet he is not malicious; rather, he seems to be seeking understanding and control over the forces that shape his world.

**Interests:** Titus's primary interest lies in the arcane arts and ancient manuscripts, which hold secrets about his own past and the nature of reality. He is drawn to forbidden knowledge and powerful rituals, such as the one described in the manuscript he reads from. His interest in these subjects suggests a sense of curiosity and intellectualism, but also a potential recklessness that may put him at odds with those who seek to keep such knowledge hidden.

**Other interests:**

* History and lore: He has a deep interest in the past, particularly the lives of those who have come before him, and the stories they tell about power, magic, and the human condition.
* The unknown and the forbidden: Titus's fascination with dark rituals and forbidden knowledge suggests that he is drawn to the unknown and the taboo.

**Goals:** Titus's ultimate goal appears to be a combination of understanding and control. He seeks to unravel the secrets of reality and tap into the power described in the manuscript, but at what cost remains unclear. It seems likely that his journey will take him down a dark path, one from which he may not return unscathed.

**Motivations:** Titus's motivations are complex and multifaceted. He is driven by curiosity and a desire for knowledge, as well as a need to understand the darkness that has defined his life. His interactions with the mysterious woman suggest that there is also a personal or emotional dimension to his quest, one that may be tied to his past or future identity.
