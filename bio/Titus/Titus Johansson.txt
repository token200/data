He is also deeply empathetic and has a strong connection to others, as evident in his relationship with Sarah.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Hair Color: Short, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical training and martial arts practice

**Interests:** Music is Titus's greatest passion, and he finds solace in creating and expressing himself through songwriting and performance. He has a deep love for the blues and folk genres, and his music reflects his own emotional journey, with lyrics that speak to themes of love, loss, and redemption. Despite his newfound passion for music, Titus still enjoys activities that allow him to stay physically active, such as rock climbing or hiking.

As he navigates this new chapter in his life, Titus is constantly seeking ways to express himself creatively and connect with others on a deeper level. With Sarah by his side, he feels like he can finally start living, rather than just existing, and he's excited to explore the world of music and connection that has opened up before him.
