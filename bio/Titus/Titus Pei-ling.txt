Physical Attributes:
Titus Pei-ling stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown and wavy, often styled in a messy, artistic manner. His eyes are a striking combination of his mother's Taiwanese brown eyes and his father's Chinese-American hazel eyes, resulting in a unique green-brown color that seems to sparkle with creativity. He has a small nose ring and a scattering of light tattoos on his arms, reflecting his cultural heritage.

Personality:
Titus is an ambitious and passionate artist, driven by a desire to honor his Taiwanese-Chinese heritage and share it with the world. He is fiercely independent and confident in his artistic vision, but also humble and open to learning from others. Titus has a deep respect for tradition and culture, which motivates him to create art that is both authentic and innovative.

Interests:
Titus's primary interest is painting, specifically traditional Taiwanese art forms such as batik, silk embroidery, and calligraphy. He is fascinated by the intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and spiritual significance of these art forms, which he seeks to incorporate into his own work. Titus also values learning about his cultural heritage and shares stories of Taiwan's rich artistic history with others. He is a voracious reader and collector of books on Taiwanese culture, art, and history.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Titus enjoys traditional Taiwanese music, particularly the guqin (an ancient zither) and the erhu (a two-stringed fiddle). He is also a fan of Taiwanese cuisine, often seeking out local restaurants and street food vendors to sample the diverse flavors of Taiwan's culinary scene.
