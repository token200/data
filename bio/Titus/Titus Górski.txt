Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Titus GÃ³rski:

**Personality:** Titus is portrayed as a brilliant but reclusive scientist. He's intensely focused on his work and willing to push himself to extreme limits to achieve his goals. His isolation and dedication to his research suggest that he may be introverted and self-sufficient, with a strong sense of discipline and determination. However, the uncertainty and self-doubt hinted at in the story ("Had he truly created something new...") reveal a more complex and introspective personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no explicit physical attributes are mentioned in the short story. However, I can make some educated guesses based on Titus's profession and appearance:

* Age: Late 30s to early 40s, suggesting a period of intense focus and research.
* Height: Approximately 5'10" (178 cm), which is slightly above average height, implying a lean and athletic build, typical of scientists who spend long hours working in laboratories.
* Eye Color: Bright blue or piercing green, possibly reflecting his intense mental focus and innovative thinking.

**Interests:** As a brilliant scientist, Titus's primary interest lies in unlocking the secrets of human consciousness. He is passionate about understanding the complexities of the brain and developing new technologies that can replicate human thought patterns (the Echo project). His work drives him to explore the boundaries of what is possible, pushing the limits of science and technology.

Additional interests and hobbies might include:

* Reading scientific literature and theoretical papers on neuroscience and AI.
* Attending conferences and seminars related to cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence.
* Participating in online forums and discussion groups focused on the intersection of technology and human consciousness.
* Experimenting with new ideas and theories outside of his research, such as meditation or mindfulness practices.

Keep in mind that these are educated guesses based on a brief story, and more details about Titus's personality, interests, and physical attributes might be revealed through further exploration of his character.
