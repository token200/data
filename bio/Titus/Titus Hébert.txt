Here is a summary of the fictional character Titus Hébert:

**Physical Attributes:** Titus Hébert stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet weathered build, a testament to his years of service in the military. His hair is dark brown and slightly graying at the temples, often worn long and messy. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that seems out of place amidst his rugged features. He has a strong jawline and a scattering of scars on his cheeks and forehead, souvenirs from his time in combat.

**Personality:** Titus is a complex and introverted individual, often struggling to open up about his past. Despite this, he possesses a deep love for literature and a desire to connect with others through the written word. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Madame Dupont, who has become a surrogate mother figure to him. Titus's reserved nature serves as a protective shield, but it also leaves him vulnerable to emotions and experiences that threaten to overwhelm him.

**Interests:** Titus's passion for literature is rivaled only by his love of history, philosophy, and poetry. He spends hours devouring classic texts, from Baudelaire to Camus, and is particularly drawn to the works of French writers. In addition to his literary pursuits, Titus enjoys taking long walks in the countryside, reading on the go, and practicing a bit of self-defense. Despite his military background, he has a surprisingly gentle soul, one that he only reveals to those closest to him.

Overall, Titus Hébert is a multifaceted individual with a rich inner life, hidden beneath his rugged exterior. As he navigates the complexities of his past and present, he finds solace in the written word and the companionship of others who accept him for who he is.
