He is well-versed in wilderness first aid, natural medicine, and navigation, making him an invaluable asset to his tribe. As a leader, he also values honor, loyalty, and protection above all else. When not leading the Wild Ones or protecting their lands, Titus enjoys spending time with his people, sharing stories and experiences around the campfire.

Overall, Titus is a complex and multifaceted individual who embodies both rugged individualism and deep-seated loyalty to those he cares about. His unique blend of skills, knowledge, and values makes him an exceptional leader among the Wild Ones, and a formidable opponent in any challenge that comes his way.
