Here's a summary of Titus Malinowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Titus is a rugged and resourceful individual with a no-nonsense attitude. He has built a reputation for being able to find anything and anyone in Prague, and he doesn't take kindly to mysteries that can't be solved. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to help those who are vulnerable. Titus also seems to have an intuitive sense of what's not quite right, as evidenced by his ability to spot the stranger from across the square.

**Physical Attributes:** Titus is described as tall and lean, although specific measurements (e.g., height) are not provided. His eye color is not specified, but it can be inferred that he has piercing or intense eyes based on how they seem to "suck in light around them". His features are likely rugged and weathered from his experiences as a soldier and private investigator.

**Interests:** As mentioned, Titus's primary interest is solving mysteries and finding missing people. He is also drawn to the darker side of human nature and has a particular knack for detecting those who prey on vulnerable individuals (e.g., ghosts or supernatural entities). His work as a private investigator seems to be closely tied to his interests in these areas.

Some additional details that could flesh out Titus's character:

* Age: Late 30s or early 40s, based on the level of experience and worldliness he appears to possess.
* Background: A complex military background, possibly with experiences in Eastern Europe or the Balkans.
