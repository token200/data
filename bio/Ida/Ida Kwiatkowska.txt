Here is a summary of Ida Kwiatkowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ida Kwiatkowska is a brilliant, reclusive mathematician with a dry sense of humor and an unwavering commitment to her work. She has a quick wit and razor-sharp mind, which she uses to tackle complex problems with calm logic and focus. Despite her introverted nature, she is passionate about mathematics and has a deep love for knowledge.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Ida stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are a striking shade of bright green, often described as piercing or intense by those who have met her.
* Hair Color: Ida's hair is dark brown and usually worn in a neat, low ponytail.
* Physical Build: She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of intense mental focus and late-night study sessions.

**Interests:** Ida is deeply passionate about mathematics, particularly number theory and elliptic curves. She spends most of her free time studying, reading, or working on mathematical problems. Her interests extend beyond academia, however, and she also enjoys:

* Reading philosophy and literature
* Listening to classical music (particularly Chopin)
* Taking long walks in the park or through the city streets, lost in thought
* Collecting rare books and mathematical texts

Ida's apartment is a reflection of her interests, with stacks of dusty math textbooks, scattered notes, and complex mathematical equations scrawled on whiteboards. Despite her love for solitude, she has a soft spot for Dr. Sofia Patel and values their intellectual debates and late-night conversations over steaming cups of tea.
