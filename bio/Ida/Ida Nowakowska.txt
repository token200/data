Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Ida Nowakowska:

**Personality:**
Ida is a introspective and creative individual who feels like an outsider in her new surroundings. She has a strong sense of longing and escape, stemming from the loss of her parents at a young age. Despite this, she is drawn to artistic expression as a way to cope with her emotions and find solace. Ida appears to be hesitant to open up to others, but also values genuine connections and community.

**Physical Attributes:**
Ida has an unassuming physical presence. Her height is around 5'6" (168 cm), which is slightly below average. Her eye color is a deep brown that seems to hold a world of emotions within its depths. Her hair is dark and straight, often worn in a simple style that reflects her more reserved nature.

**Interests:**
Ida's primary interest lies in art, specifically painting. She finds solace in the process of creating, losing herself in the colors and textures of the canvases. Her background in traditional Polish culture also seems to influence her appreciation for muted, earthy tones, as seen in the faded colors of the art studio she visits. Ida is drawn to the idea of creative expression as a means of escape and healing.

The mention of her parents' passing suggests that Ida may be interested in exploring themes related to grief, loss, and identity through her art. Her connection with the art studio and its owner implies a desire for community and support in her journey towards self-expression.
