**Personality:** Irene Aber appears to be a curious and observant person. She notices Jack's work on human behavior and engages in conversation with him, asking questions to understand his perspective. She also seems patient and understanding, waiting for Jack to share his thoughts without prying or interrupting. Additionally, she has a dry sense of humor, as evident when she chuckles at the observation about people staring at their phones.

**Physical Attributes:** Irene's physical attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the short story, so I will fill in some details. She is likely a young adult to middle-aged woman with an athletic build, given her ability to wait patiently without showing signs of discomfort. Her height is around 5'7" (170 cm), which allows her to maintain eye contact with Jack without straining. Her eye color is blue, reflecting her calm and observant nature.

**Interests:** Irene's interests seem to align with those of the people she encounters, particularly in public spaces. She notices the prevalence of phone use and its effects on human interaction. This observation likely stems from her interest in observing human behavior, similar to Jack's work. Her curiosity about the fleeting experiences that captivate humans suggests that she values depth over breadth, focusing on meaningful connections rather than superficial interactions.

These traits are inferred based on Irene's interactions with Jack and her engagement with his ideas about human behavior.
