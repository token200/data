Here is a summary of Irene Rivera's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Irene Rivera is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a fiery spirit and sharp tongue. On the surface, she appears tough and resilient, having shouldered the burden of raising her daughter on her own for years. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a vulnerable and sensitive soul who has been wounded by past heartbreaks. Despite her guarded nature, Irene is deeply empathetic and cares deeply about those she loves, particularly her daughter Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:** Irene is a petite woman in her mid-30s, standing at approximately 5'2" (157 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, and her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to bore into those she meets. Despite her youthful appearance, Irene has the scars of time etched onto her face, including a smattering of fine lines around her eyes and mouth.

**Interests:** In her free time, Irene enjoys working out at the local gym to stay physically fit and mentally focused. She is also an avid reader, devouring books on self-help, psychology, and women's empowerment. As a single mother, Irene has developed a passion for cooking and trying new recipes, often experimenting with different cuisines and flavors in her spare time. On Sundays, she loves to spend quality time with Sophia, taking her daughter on outdoor adventures or simply enjoying quiet moments together.

As the story suggests, Irene's interests and hobbies have been put on hold while she focused on raising Sophia, but now that Alex has re-entered her life, it will be interesting to see how she balances her newfound connection with her daughter's needs.
