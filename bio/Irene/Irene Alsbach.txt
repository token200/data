Here's a summary of Irene Alsbach's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Irene is a confident and resourceful private investigator with a knack for staying one step ahead of the game. She has a strong sense of determination and can think on her feet, making her a formidable detective. Her skills in disguise and deception have earned her a reputation as a master manipulator, but she also possesses a sharp intuition that helps her stay focused and alert. Despite her tough exterior, Irene has a compassionate side and is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.

**Physical Attributes:** Irene is likely in her mid-to-late 30s, with a slender yet athletic build that belies her razor-sharp intellect. Her height is around 5'8" (172 cm), which allows her to easily blend into crowds without drawing attention to herself. Her piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential vulnerability. Her dark hair is always impeccably styled, and her sharp jawline is accentuated by a subtle scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Interests:** Irene's interests are centered around her work as a private investigator, with a particular focus on high-stakes cases involving art, jewelry, or other luxury items. She has a keen eye for detail and is always on the lookout for clues that might lead to a breakthrough in a case. Outside of work, Irene enjoys exploring new cities and experiencing different cultures, often using her skills of observation to notice details that others might miss. She also has a passion for martial arts and takes regular classes to stay physically fit and mentally sharp.

It's worth noting that while Irene is an expert in disguise and deception, she seems to have a somewhat vulnerable side, as hinted at by her reaction to the feeling of being watched on the streets. This vulnerability suggests that there may be more to Irene than meets the eye, and that she may have personal demons or motivations that drive her actions beyond purely professional ones.
