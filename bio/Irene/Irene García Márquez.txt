**Physical Attributes:** Irene stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with dark hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to hold a wealth of mystery and depth. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of sailing and exploring the ocean.

**Personality:** Irene is a free-spirited individual with a deep connection to nature and the sea. She is fiercely independent, having set out on her own journeys as a young adult, but also values family and tradition, being deeply rooted in the stories and wisdom passed down from her abuela. This inner balance allows her to navigate complex emotions and find solace in the ocean's vastness.

**Interests:** Irene's passions lie at the intersection of storytelling, sailing, and exploration. She is an avid reader of maritime history and mythology, often pouring over ancient texts to learn more about the secrets of the sea. As a skilled sailor, she enjoys navigating by the stars and identifying different types of seaweed, which allow her to tap into the ocean's rhythms and patterns. Her experiences have also sparked a deep curiosity about the stories that flow through her veins like the tides themselves - she is driven to unravel the mysteries of her own identity and become a guardian of the ocean's secrets.

Additionally, Irene has an innate sense of wonder and awe for the world around her, which drives her to explore and seek out new experiences. Her encounters with the mysterious old boat have only heightened this sense, leaving her feeling like she is on the cusp of discovering something much larger than herself.
