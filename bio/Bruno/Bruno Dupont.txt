He is ruthless and cunning in his professional endeavors, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve success. However, beneath this façade lies a tragic figure driven by the ghosts of his own making.

**Physical Attributes:** Bruno stands at around 6'1" with an athletic build. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up before rendering his verdict. He has short, dark hair that is always perfectly styled, adding to his polished and put-together appearance. Despite his rugged demeanor, he carries himself with an air of sophistication and poise.

**Interests:** Bruno's interests are diverse and often contradictory. On the surface, he appears to be a ruthless businessman driven solely by success and profit.
