Despite these inner struggles, Schulz possessed a profound sense of empathy and compassion for others, which he expressed through his writing.

**Interests:**
Schulz's interests were largely focused on his art and writing. As an artist, he was drawn to the world of surrealism and realism, and his drawings and watercolors reflect this blend of styles. His writing style was equally innovative, blending elements of fantasy and realism to create a sense of disorientation and unease.
