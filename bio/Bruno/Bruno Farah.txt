Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Bruno Farah:

**Physical Attributes:**
Bruno Farah is a tall and lean individual, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm). His eye color is a deep brown that seems to bore into those he meets. His hair is dark and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look perpetually disheveled.

**Personality:**
Bruno Farah is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a reputation for being one step ahead of the game. He has an air of confidence that borders on arrogance, but beneath this exterior lies a sharp mind and a strong moral compass. Bruno is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to work alone rather than as part of a team. This makes him a lone wolf, always keeping his distance from others.

**Interests:**
Bruno's interests are closely tied to his work in cybersecurity. He spends most of his free time reading books on computer science and philosophy, particularly works by Plato and Nietzsche. When he's not working, Bruno enjoys playing chess (he's an avid player) and hiking in the mountains. He's also a fan of punk rock music and has been known to attend underground concerts and festivals. Despite his tough exterior, Bruno has a soft spot for classic literature and often finds himself drawn to characters like Hamlet and Macbeth.

**Hobbies:**
In addition to reading and playing chess, Bruno enjoys collecting rare and vintage computer hardware. He's particularly interested in the history of computing and the evolution of software development. This hobby allows him to stay connected to his roots as a hacker and appreciate the beauty of old technology.

Overall, Bruno Farah is a unique individual with a rich inner life and a deep passion for his work. His complexities and contradictions make him a compelling character who is always ready to take on the next challenge that comes his way.
