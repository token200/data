Here is a summary of the fictional character Bruno Kovács:

**Physical Attributes:** Bruno Kovács stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, hinting at his rough past. His eyes are a deep brown, often tired and worn from years of struggling. He has short, dark hair that's starting to gray at the temples, and a scruffy beard that frames his face.

**Personality:** Bruno is a complex, brooding individual with a troubled past. He's fiercely independent and has learned to rely only on himself, which has made him wary of getting too close to people or forming attachments. However, as he meets new friends and experiences the power of resistance and community, he begins to open up and reveal his vulnerable side. Bruno is intensely passionate about social justice and is willing to take risks to fight for what he believes in.

**Interests:** Bruno's interests revolve around music, literature, and poetry. He has a deep love for the works of Hungarian writers like Attila József and Sándor Márai, and he's fascinated by the city's rich cultural heritage. In his free time, he enjoys playing the guitar and writing his own poetry, which often reflects his experiences as an outsider and his desire to speak truth to power.

**Background:** Bruno hails from Budapest, Hungary, where he grew up in a poor but vibrant community. He's been involved in various underground movements and has had run-ins with the authorities, which led him to leave the city in search of a fresh start. His past is marked by heartbreak, loss, and disillusionment, but he's determined to find his place in the world and contribute to the fight against oppression.

**Motivations:** Bruno's primary motivation is to find purpose and belonging in a new community that shares his values. He's drawn to the ideals of resistance and revolution, and he's eager to learn from others who have also fought for justice and freedom. As he becomes more involved with the group in Prague, he begins to see himself as part of something larger than just individual survival – a sense of belonging to a collective that can offer him support, solidarity, and a new sense of direction.
