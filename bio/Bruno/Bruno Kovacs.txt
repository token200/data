Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Bruno Kovacs:

**Personality:** Bruno is a charismatic and resourceful individual with a mysterious past. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as enigmatic or intimidating to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior, he has a strong sense of justice and a desire to use his skills for good. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking on cases that others might consider too difficult or too morally gray.

**Physical Attributes:** Bruno Kovacs is approximately 6'1" (185 cm) tall with an athletic build, honed from years of street life and cat-and-mouse games. His hair is dark brown and styled in a way that adds to his mysterious aura. His eyes are a piercing blue, often seeming to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many close calls.

**Interests:** Bruno's interests are largely centered around his work as a thief-turned-justice-seeker. He enjoys the thrill of planning and executing complex heists, often taking on cases that push him to think creatively and outside the box. When not working, he enjoys spending time in Budapest, exploring its hidden corners and absorbing its rich history and culture.

Beyond his work, Bruno has a passion for cars and classic motorcycles, which he's been restoring in his spare time. He also enjoys playing chess and other strategy games, often using these as mental exercises to keep his mind sharp and focused.

In terms of personal relationships, Bruno is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, but he can be guarded and selective when it comes to opening up to others. He's deeply haunted by his past mistakes and the people he's hurt along the way, which makes him wary of getting too close to anyone or anything.
