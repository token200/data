**Physical Attributes:** Bruno stands at 5'8" with long, curly brown hair and bright hazel eyes. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:** Bruno is a free-spirited individual who embodies creativity and confidence. She is an adventurous soul, always eager to explore new places and experience different cultures. As an artist, she is passionate, expressive, and unafraid to take risks with her work.

**Interests:** Bruno's primary interests lie in painting, art, and music. She spends most of her days experimenting with new techniques, exploring the city's street art scene, and listening to eclectic playlists that fuel her creativity. When not creating art, she can be found attending underground music festivals or wandering through the vibrant markets of New York City.
