As a former Soviet spy, he has honed skills that have served him well in his new life as a janitor, but he also carries the emotional scars of his past experiences.

His eye color is a piercing blue, which seems out of place among the more subdued tones of his everyday attire. His features are chiseled and angular, giving him a strong yet unassuming presence.
