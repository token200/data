He has a chiseled jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his air of mystery.

**Personality:** Mate Webb is an enigmatic figure, exuding confidence and charisma wherever he goes. As a master thief, he has honed his skills to be one step ahead of his adversaries, but beneath the surface lies a complex web of emotions. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else, which makes him wary of getting close to others. Despite this, there is an air of vulnerability about him that Sophia seems to sense.

**Other Details:** Mate Webb is known to be highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to any situation. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, but also has a tendency to push people away when they get too close. Despite this, there is an undeniable attraction between him and Sophia that threatens to upend his carefully constructed world.
