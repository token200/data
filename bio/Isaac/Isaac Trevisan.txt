Based on the short story, here is a summary of Isaac Trevisan's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Isaac Trevisan is a private investigator with a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of intuition. He has seen it all in his line of work and has developed a tough exterior to cope with the darker aspects of human nature. However, beneath this gruff demeanor lies a complex individual driven by a desire to uncover the truth and help those in need. Isaac is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a hint of grey that suggests he's seen his fair share of darkness.
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and messy, giving off an air of dishevelment.
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical activity while investigating crime scenes or following suspects.
* Age: Late 30s/early 40s, with a weathered face that speaks to his many years in the line of duty.

**Interests:** Isaac is deeply invested in solving complex mysteries and uncovering hidden truths. He has a passion for digging deep into cases, often sacrificing his personal life in the process. Outside of work, he may have few hobbies or interests, as his work dominates his every waking moment. However, it's possible that he has a hidden interest in literature or poetry, given the mention of "dusty files and worn photographs" in his office.

It's worth noting that these attributes are not explicitly stated in the short story, but rather inferred through Isaac's actions, dialogue, and physical environment.
