He is calculating, measured in his words, and can come across as unreadable, making it difficult for others to gauge his true intentions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - This height suggests Isaac is above average but not exceptionally tall.
* Eye Color: Dark brown or almost black eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at. The lack of detail about eye color makes it difficult to determine the exact shade, leaving it to the reader's imagination.

As a master thief, his skills are geared towards finding and stealing these items. However, the story also hints at Isaac being curious about unlocking long-buried secrets and potentially uncovering hidden truths about history.
