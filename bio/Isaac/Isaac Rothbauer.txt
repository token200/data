Based on the short story, here's a summary of Isaac Rothbauer's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Isaac Rothbauer is a brilliant and driven individual who has sacrificed personal relationships and well-being for the sake of unlocking the secrets of quantum mechanics. He appears to be intensely focused and concentrated, with a sharp mind that remains razor-sharp even under pressure. This suggests that he is highly intelligent, resourceful, and determined, but also possibly reclusive or isolated due to his obsessive nature.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide many details about Isaac's physical appearance. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that:

* He may be a relatively slender or athletic build, given his ability to work tirelessly in his makeshift laboratory.
* His height is unknown, but he appears to be physically capable of working at a console for extended periods.
* His eye color is likely brown or dark brown, as it is not mentioned in the story.

**Interests:** Isaac's primary interest is quantum mechanics, which has consumed his entire career. He is deeply invested in understanding the mysteries of the universe and has sacrificed everything to unlock its secrets. It can be inferred that he also has a strong curiosity about the implications of his discoveries, particularly those related to Erebus' behavior.

Some possible interests or hobbies that Isaac may have outside of his scientific pursuits include:

* Reading scientific literature and journals
* Participating in online forums or discussions with fellow scientists
* Conducting experiments and testing hypotheses
* Studying theoretical models and simulations
* Considering the philosophical implications of his discoveries

It's worth noting that these are speculative suggestions based on the provided story, and Isaac's actual interests and personality may be more complex and nuanced.
