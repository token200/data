**Physical Attributes:**
Isaac Walker is a man in his late forties with a rugged appearance that reflects his rough past. He stands at about 5'10" with a lean build, which has likely been shaped by years of traveling on foot or driving long distances. His hair is dark and worn, often falling across his forehead in a messy manner, and he sports a weathered face with deep lines etched into his cheeks and brow. His eyes are a piercing brown that seem to hold a world of sadness and regret within them. He wears a worn leather jacket slung over one shoulder, which adds to his air of ruggedness, and his feet are clad in scuffed up work boots.

**Personality:**
Isaac is a brooding and introspective individual who has been forced to confront the demons of his past on the open road. He is haunted by the memories of his mistakes and is desperate to clear his name and find redemption. Despite this, he exudes a sense of determination and resilience that allows him to keep moving forward, even in the face of adversity. Isaac is fiercely independent and doesn't like to trust easily, which has led him to build walls around himself over the years. However, as he meets people like Gus, who see past his rough exterior, he begins to open up and let others in.

**Interests:**
Isaac's interests are centered around finding work, redemption, and a sense of belonging. He is drawn to places that offer opportunities for employment or a fresh start, which often means taking on menial jobs or working long hours to earn enough money to keep moving. In his free time, Isaac enjoys driving, listening to music, and reading classic novels by authors like Steinbeck and Hemingway. He has a deep love of the open road and the freedom that comes with traveling without attachment or expectation.

**Other Details:**
Isaac's past is shrouded in mystery, but it's clear that he has been involved in some kind of trouble. His name being whispered by the townspeople suggests that he may have committed a crime, although he swears innocence. This sense of guilt and shame hangs over him like a cloud, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and isolated. Despite this, Isaac is desperate for connection and acceptance, which leads him to seek out people like Gus who can offer a listening ear or a helping hand.
