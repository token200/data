Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Isaac Salvini:

**Personality:** Isaac Salvini is a brilliant, reclusive scientist with a dry wit and a passion for discovery. Despite his exceptional intellect, he has a tendency to be introverted and guarded, preferring the company of data and theories over people. However, once you gain his trust, he opens up to reveal a kind and vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:** Isaac is a tall, slender man in his late 40s, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an angular face and piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often unkempt, and he has a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** As a scientist, Isaac's primary interest lies in unraveling the mysteries of the universe, particularly in the realm of dark matter. He is fascinated by its properties, behavior, and potential applications. Beyond science, Isaac enjoys studying ancient texts and philosophical treatises on cosmology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality.

Additionally, Isaac has a strong appreciation for literature, music (particularly classical and jazz), and art. In his rare moments of relaxation, he often finds solace in reading, playing the piano, or sketching abstract patterns inspired by celestial mechanics.

It's worth noting that Isaac's experiences with Aria Flynn have likely broadened his perspectives on life beyond science, hinting at a growing interest in the human heart and personal connections.
