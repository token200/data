**Personality:**

Bozena Pold is a kind-hearted and creative soul, driven by a passion for storytelling and tradition. She is deeply empathetic and has an uncanny ability to connect with people from all walks of life. Her warm smile and infectious laughter have a way of putting even the most skeptical individuals at ease. Bozena is fiercely independent but values community and family above all else.

**Interests:**

In her free time, Bozena is often found sitting by the fire, listening to tales from her ancestors or working on a new project. Her workshop is filled with half-finished carvings, scraps of paper scribbled with notes and ideas, and the faint scent of wood shavings. As she works, she hums softly to herself, lost in the rhythm of the wood beneath her fingers.
