While this summary provides a more detailed picture of Bozena's personality and interests, I've added some missing details to flesh out her character:

* Age: Late 30s/Early 40s (around 38-42 years old)
* Background: Born and raised in Willow Creek, Bozena has lived in the town all her life. Her parents were high school sweethearts who instilled in her the values of hard work, kindness, and community service.
* Family: Bozena is a single mother to a young daughter named Sophia, who often helps her out at the boutique and learns about fashion from a young age.

These additional details should provide a more comprehensive understanding of Bozena's character and help bring her to life as a well-rounded, relatable individual.
