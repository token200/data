Based on the short story, here is a summary of Bozena Becker's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bozena Becker is an enigmatic and introspective person. She is described as having "few words," which suggests that she is not one for small talk or idle chatter. Despite her reclusive nature, Bozena has a deep passion for art and a strong creative vision. She is intense and focused when working on her sculptures, to the point where it seems like she's trying to wrestle something beautiful out of the marble.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there isn't much information about Bozena's physical appearance in the short story. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the description of her eyes and glasses. It appears that Bozena has a pair of reading glasses perched on the end of her nose, which suggests that she may be slightly older and possibly have some prescriptive vision correction. We can also infer that she is likely in her 40s or 50s, based on the fact that she has gained a cult following in the art world.

In terms of height, it's difficult to say for certain, but Bozena seems like someone who values quiet contemplation and focuses intently on her work. She may not be the tallest person, given her emphasis on precise chiseling and manipulation of marble.

**Eye Color:** The story doesn't specify Bozena's eye color, but based on the description of her eyes as "narrowing slightly" behind her glasses, we can infer that she has brown or hazel eyes. Her eyes seem to be a deep, rich color that is warm and expressive.

**Interests:** As an artist, Bozena's primary interest is in creating beautiful sculptures that explore the human experience. She seems particularly drawn to themes of loneliness, connection, and the complexities of human relationships. In her own words, she describes 'Echoes' as "about the connections we make with others, even when we're alone." This suggests that Bozena values empathy, introspection, and a deep understanding of the human condition.

Bozena is also deeply passionate about her art, to the point where it becomes an all-consuming aspect of her life. She spends most of her days holed up in her small studio, chiseling away at blocks of marble to reveal the beauty within.
