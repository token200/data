Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Bozena Bergstrom:

**Personality:** Bozena is described as a free-spirited artist with an unconventional approach to life. She is confident, unapologetic, and true to herself, which is reflected in her art. Her friends have always known that she is a "true original," messy, unpredictable, and full of life.

**Physical Attributes:** Bozena has not been explicitly described as having any distinctive physical features, but we can make some educated guesses based on the story. She is likely to be petite or slender, given her description as someone who lives in a "colorful, cluttered" studio apartment. Her height is unknown, but she seems comfortable in her own space and able to navigate it easily.

Her eye color has not been mentioned either, so we can only speculate that she might have bright, expressive eyes that reflect her creative personality.

**Interests:** As an artist, Bozena's primary interest is creating art. She loves experimenting with different colors, shapes, and textures, and is passionate about expressing herself through her work. Her interests likely extend beyond art, as the story suggests she has a sense of curiosity and appreciation for the world around her (e.g., she overheard two art critics discussing an exhibit at a nearby gallery).

Bozena also seems to value individuality and self-expression, which is reflected in her desire to showcase her unconventional art. Her interests might include:

* Artistic experimentation and exploration
* Creative expression and personal growth
* Connecting with like-minded individuals who appreciate uniqueness and individuality
* Understanding the world around her through observation and experience

Overall, Bozena Bergstrom appears to be a creative, confident, and self-assured individual who is unapologetically true to herself and her art.
