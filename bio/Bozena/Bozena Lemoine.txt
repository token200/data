Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Bozena Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bozena Lemoine, also known as "La Vie En Rose," appears to be an enigmatic figure with a deep fascination for the mysterious and unknown. She has a passion for exploring the human condition and sees beyond the surface level. Her art is characterized by its boldness, unflinching nature, and ability to uncover hidden truths. Despite her reputation as a master of the macabre, she seems to be driven by a desire to understand and connect with others on a deeper level.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much detail about Bozena Lemoine's physical appearance. However, I can make some educated guesses based on her stage name "La Vie En Rose," which suggests a French or European background. Assuming she is of average height and age, let's give her:

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright, piercing green eyes that seem to sparkle with an otherworldly intensity.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Bozena Lemoine is deeply invested in exploring the human condition through her art. She has a natural curiosity about the world and its secrets, which drives her to capture images that reveal hidden truths. Her fascination with the macabre suggests a darker side to her nature, but it's clear that she sees this aspect of life as a means to understand humanity better.

In terms of hobbies or interests outside of photography, I can imagine Bozena Lemoine being drawn to:

* Reading occult literature and folklore to deepen her understanding of the unknown
* Exploring abandoned or haunted locations for inspiration (as seen in her work on the ancestral home)
* Engaging with other artists who share similar interests and values

Keep in mind that these details are purely speculative, based on my interpretation of the short story.
