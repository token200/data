His passion for Impressionist paintings and modern art drives him to experiment with new techniques and mediums, often incorporating elements of traditional French art into his own unique style. Timofey also has a deep appreciation for literature and poetry, finding solace in the words of great writers like Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

**Hobbies:** When not creating or performing, Timofey enjoys exploring the countryside with Colette, collecting rare books and prints at local markets, and experimenting with wine-making (a hobby inherited from his family's vineyard). He is also an avid traveler, always seeking out new experiences and inspiration for his art.
