Here's a summary of Nora Briedis' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Nora appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. She has been searching for her estranged sister Sophia for weeks, which suggests that she is driven and focused on achieving her goal. Despite being wary of Lena at first, Nora's curiosity and desire for closure lead her to engage in a conversation with the stranger. Her bluntness when asking "What do you want from me?" indicates that she can be direct and straightforward in her interactions.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the description of the woman with striking blue eyes and jet-black hair, it is likely that Lena's physical appearance matches this description as well. As Nora has never seen Sophia in person before meeting Lena, we cannot determine their physical characteristics. However, given the similarities in facial features between Lena and Sophia, it's possible that Nora's sister may have similar attributes.

**Interests:** The story doesn't explicitly state Nora's interests, but based on her motivation to find Sophia after five years of estrangement, it can be inferred that she is interested in reconnecting with her sister and possibly resolving their past conflicts. Nora also appears to be curious about Sophia's life and willing to engage in conversation with Lena, suggesting that she values personal connections and relationships.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide much information about Nora's daily life, habits, or long-term goals, which are common aspects of character development. However, based on this brief encounter, we can infer some aspects of her personality, interests, and possible physical appearance.
