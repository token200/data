She is also drawn to the antique shop and its owner, Mrs. Argent, suggesting that she may have an interest in history, art, or rare artifacts. The discovery of the ancient tome bound in black leather further suggests that she has a curiosity about the unknown, the mystical, or the occult.

* Visiting antique shops and browsing through curiosities
