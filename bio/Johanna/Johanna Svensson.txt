Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Johanna Svensson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Johanna appears to be a determined and introspective person. She is fiercely dedicated to solving the case, but also open to new perspectives and ideas. Her analytical mind is evident in her ability to pour over crime scene photos and forensic reports, but she also knows when to step back and reevaluate from a different angle.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: Johanna is not explicitly mentioned as being of average height, but based on the description of her standing at the edge of the fjord with her feet sunk into the damp earth, it suggests that she may be relatively tall.
- Eye Color: The story does not mention Johanna's eye color explicitly, so I have chosen to leave this detail out for now. 
- Hair and Skin: No specific details are mentioned about Johanna's hair or skin tone.

**Interests:** As a detective, Johanna is clearly interested in solving crimes and unraveling mysteries. Her work with the Stockholm police department suggests that she has a strong commitment to justice and public service. Outside of her professional life, it appears that she values nature and the environment (she notices the small patch of bright green moss growing amidst the rocks) and appreciates moments of solitude and reflection. She also seems to appreciate human connection, as evidenced by her interaction with colleague Anders.
