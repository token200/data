Based on the inspiration provided, I have created a new character profile for Johanna Ozoliņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Johanna is a 25-year-old woman with an ethereal quality to her features. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail when she's working on her art. Her eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, with a mischievous sparkle that hints at her creative energy.

**Personality:**
Johanna is a free-spirited individual with a passion for self-expression and identity exploration. She is fiercely independent and values autonomy above all else. Despite growing up in a small town where conformity was encouraged, Johanna has always felt like an outsider, yearning to break free from societal expectations and forge her own path. Her artistic expression allows her to tap into this sense of restlessness and channel it into something beautiful.

**Interests:**
Johanna's primary interests revolve around art, music, and social justice. She is deeply fascinated by the concept of identity and its many facets, often exploring these themes in her own work. When not creating art, Johanna enjoys attending concerts, reading poetry, and engaging in lively debates about politics and philosophy. Her love for travel and cultural exchange has also inspired her to explore the world beyond her small town, seeking out new experiences and perspectives that enrich her art and inform her worldview.

**Additional Details:**
Johanna's family background plays a significant role in shaping her personality and artistic vision. Her older brother, who pursued a career in business, is often mentioned as a cautionary tale of the constraints she hopes to avoid. Johanna's parents, while well-intentioned, inadvertently contributed to her feelings of stifled creativity, encouraging her to pursue a more "stable" path.

In contrast, Sofia becomes an inspiring mentor and friend, offering guidance on how to navigate the complexities of artistic expression while staying true to oneself. Through her relationship with Sofia, Johanna gains a deeper understanding of the power of art as a medium for transformation and self-discovery.
