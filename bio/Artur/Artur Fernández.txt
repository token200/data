Here is a summary of Artur Fernández's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Artur Fernández stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is a rich, dark brown color that often falls across his forehead in messy waves. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo blue, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with creativity when he talks about art or passion projects. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident and a silver stud in his right earlobe.

**Personality:**
Artur Fernández is an introspective and passionate individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is fiercely dedicated to his craft, often losing himself in the creative process. His love for art is all-consuming, and he has a unique ability to tap into the emotional depth of those around him. Artur is intensely private and guarded when it comes to his personal life, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings locked away from prying eyes. Despite this, there's an undeniable air of charisma surrounding him, making people feel drawn to his presence.

**Interests:**
Artur Fernández has a deep love for art in all its forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, and music. He spends most of his free time experimenting with new techniques and mediums, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Artur is also an avid collector of antiques, vintage clothing, and eclectic trinkets, which often find their way into his art pieces or studio decor.

Artur's fascination with Malasaña's abandoned studio and its history drives much of his creative process, inspiring him to explore themes of decay, transformation, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. His connection to the space seems almost spiritual, as if it speaks directly to a part of him that's hard to put into words.

When not in the studio or exploring new artistic avenues, Artur can be found listening to vinyl records, sipping wine with friends, or practicing yoga to center himself.
