Here's a summary of Artur Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Artur is a complex and introspective individual. He appears to be driven by his material success, often prioritizing wealth and status over personal connections and meaningful relationships. However, as the story reveals, he is also deeply human with emotional vulnerabilities and a desire for connection and purpose. Despite his polished exterior, he struggles with feelings of disconnection and emptiness.

**Physical Attributes:** Artur is likely a tall, well-built individual, given his profession as a senior investment banker in Goldman Sachs. His height could be around 6 feet (183 cm) to 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), typical for many East Asian men. His eye color is likely brown, common among Chinese and Korean populations.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that Artur has a passion for his work as an investment banker, particularly in making high-stakes deals. However, this drive seems to have come at a cost, leaving him feeling disconnected from others. He may also enjoy luxury cars and beautiful women, which were part of his life before the events of the story.

Beyond these interests, Artur's conversation with his mother reveals a fondness for art, music, and simple conversations about everyday topics like the weather. These seemingly mundane pursuits suggest that he values quieter, more introspective moments in life.

Artur's desire to reconnect with his parents' humble past and explore alternative forms of connection also hints at an interest in personal growth, spirituality, or exploring different aspects of human experience beyond his high-stakes career.
