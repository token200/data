**Personality:** Artur Keiko is an enigmatic and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. He has a prickly demeanor that often keeps people at bay, but his colleagues respect him for his unwavering commitment to solving cases. His years of experience on the streets have hardened him, and he can come across as unyielding or even aloof to those who don't know him. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep well of emotion and a fierce determination to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Artur Keiko stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of physical activity on the job. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly but always slightly disheveled, and his eyes are a piercing green that seem to bore into those he interrogates. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely obtained during one of his many close calls as an investigator.

**Interests:** Artur's primary interest is justice, and his driving force in life is to uncover the truth about his sister Sophia's disappearance. He is intensely focused on solving cases, often becoming completely absorbed in his work to the exclusion of everything else. In his free time, he may enjoy reading books or taking long walks, but even these activities are likely influenced by his investigative pursuits.

Other interests that might be inferred from Artur's background include:

* Investigating and learning about various fields related to justice, such as forensic science, psychology, and criminology.
* Following true crime stories or unsolved cases, which can spark new ideas for his own investigations.
* Studying his sister's disappearance and its connections to his other cases, in an effort to understand the larger patterns and connections that might lead him to a breakthrough.
