Here's a summary of Artur Meier's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Artur Meier is a complex and enigmatic individual. He has a reputation for being unorthodox in his methods and willing to disregard authority to achieve results. He is charismatic and charming, able to use these traits to intimidate suspects and get them to open up. At the same time, he appears to be driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth, even if it means challenging established norms.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Sandy Blonde
* Age: Late 40s/Early 50s

It's worth noting that these physical attributes are not explicitly stated in the short story, so they can be considered fictional details.

**Interests:** Based on his profession as a detective and his involvement in high-profile cases, it's likely that Meier has a strong interest in:

* Criminology: He is deeply invested in understanding the motivations and behaviors of criminals.
* Corruption: As someone who uncovers massive corruption scandals, he is clearly interested in exposing wrongdoing and holding those responsible accountable.
* Justice: Despite his willingness to bend rules, Meier seems driven by a desire for justice and fairness.

However, it's also possible that his interest in these areas has led him down some dark paths, making him increasingly cynical and troubled. His involvement in the cover-up with Klaus suggests that he may be more nuanced in his motivations than initially meets the eye.
