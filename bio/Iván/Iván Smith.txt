Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Iván Smith's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Iván is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a mix of traits. On one hand, he has a reputation for being a skilled thief, which suggests that he is cunning, resourceful, and possibly reckless. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Iván is also driven by a desire to create and be creative, rather than simply seeking thrills and excitement. He struggles with temptation and addiction, but ultimately finds redemption through his love of art.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, we don't know much about Iván's physical appearance beyond the fact that he is male. However, I can fill in some gaps based on the context:

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - this height suggests that Iván is lean and agile, which would be advantageous for a thief.
* Eye Color: Brown or hazel - given his connection to New York City, it's likely that Iván has dark eye color, but I've also considered the possibility of hazel as a more nuanced option.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Iván's love of art is a key part of his transformation and redemption. He finds solace in creating something beautiful, rather than seeking thrills through crime. This interest suggests that Iván has an appreciation for aesthetics and a desire to express himself creatively.

Additional interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* A fascination with museums and high art - Iván's obsession with the sculpture he encounters at the museum suggests that he is drawn to the rarefied world of art criticism and connoisseurship.
* An appreciation for street smarts and survival instincts - growing up on the streets, Iván learned to rely on his wits and cunning to survive, which has served him well in his adventures as a thief.

Overall, Iván's personality is complex and multifaceted, driven by both creative and destructive impulses.
