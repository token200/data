Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Iván Taro:

**Personality:** Iván Taro is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, he exudes confidence and charm, using these qualities to build a reputation as a skilled thief and con artist. However, beneath this façade lies a vulnerable soul who feels seen and understood by Sophia for the first time in his life. He possesses a deep sense of curiosity and is drawn to people, particularly women, who can see beyond his surface-level charm. Iván Taro's softer side reveals a compassionate and wise individual who is capable of offering words of understanding and support.

**Physical Attributes:** Iván Taro stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of evading capture. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up before deciding whether to reveal his true nature. His dark hair is often unkempt, and his sharp jawline is accentuated by a subtle scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures. Iván Taro's style is understated yet stylish, often dressing in tailored suits that allow him to blend into the shadows.

**Interests:** Outside of his life as a thief and con artist, Iván Taro finds solace in nature and the night sky. He has a deep appreciation for the stars and often spends hours gazing up at them from the riverbank, feeling at peace with himself and the world around him. He is also an avid observer of human behavior, using this insight to inform his heists and understand the motivations of those he meets. Iván Taro's interests extend beyond observation, however, as he has a creative streak and enjoys writing poetry in his spare time.

It is worth noting that while we do not have information about what books or media he likes it can be assumed that he would appreciate some works of mystery/thriller or literary fiction
