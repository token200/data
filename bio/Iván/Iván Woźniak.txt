Here is a summary of Iván Woźniak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Iván stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm), with an athletic build developed from years of military service. His eye color is a piercing brown that seems to bore into those he meets, hinting at the depths of his introspective nature. His hair is dark and often unkempt, framing a face that is both worn and weathered.

**Personality:**
Iván's personality is complex and multi-faceted. On the surface, he appears to be a rugged individualist with a no-nonsense approach to life. However, beneath this exterior lies a deeply introspective and empathetic person who has been shaped by his traumatic experiences as a soldier. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries in pursuit of the truth. Despite his tough exterior, Iván has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect and serve others.

**Interests:**
Iván's interests are centered around storytelling, observation, and the pursuit of justice. He is an avid reader and researcher, devouring books on history, literature, and psychology. His experiences as a soldier have given him a keen eye for detail, which he applies to his work as a private investigator. Iván is also drawn to music, particularly traditional Polish folk melodies that evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing in him.

In terms of hobbies, Iván enjoys long walks along the Vistula River, where he can clear his mind and reflect on his experiences. He is also an amateur writer, often scribbling notes and ideas in a worn leather journal that contains fragments of his thoughts and insights.
