Here is a summary of the fictional character Iván Bauer:

**Physical Attributes:**
Iván Bauer is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, with a slender build. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) and has dark brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His hair is probably dark brown or black, often styled neatly but with a hint of tousled messiness.

**Personality:**
Iván is a driven and determined individual, fiercely committed to uncovering the truth and exposing corruption. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having abandoned his radical views from his father's activism days to forge a new path as a journalist. Iván is resourceful and quick-witted, able to think on his feet and navigate complex situations with ease. However, he also has a strong sense of justice and can be fiercely protective of those he cares about.

**Interests:**
Iván is passionate about journalism and storytelling, using his skills to expose corruption and bring attention to marginalized voices. He is deeply interested in politics and history, having grown up on the streets of Budapest and learned from his father's activism days. Iván is also a curious and analytical thinker, able to piece together seemingly disparate clues and follow leads to uncover hidden truths.

It seems that Márton is likely hiding something from Iván, which may be connected to Iván's latest investigation or perhaps even his own past.
