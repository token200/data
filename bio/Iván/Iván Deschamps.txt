Here's a summary of Iván Deschamps' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Iván stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of intense physical training. His piercing green eyes are his most distinctive feature, with irises that seem to hold a thousand secrets. His chiseled features, sharp jawline, and dark hair give him a strong, angular face. Iván's style is understated yet sophisticated, reflecting his refined taste in luxury items.

**Personality:** Iván is a complex, enigmatic individual with a troubled past. He is intensely private and guarded, with a natural ability to blend into the shadows. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability, driven by a traumatic experience that has left emotional scars. Despite his tough exterior, Iván is intensely sensitive and empathetic, particularly when it comes to those he cares about.

**Interests:** As a former spy, Iván's interests lie in the world of espionage and international relations. He is highly intelligent and strategic, with a talent for tactical analysis and problem-solving. However, now that he has left the spy game behind, Iván's interests have shifted towards more artistic pursuits. He is fascinated by art history, philosophy, and literature, which Colette's gallery has introduced him to.

In his free time, Iván enjoys long walks on the beach, sailing, and practicing yoga. He is drawn to nature's beauty and tranquility, finding solace in its calming presence. Despite his tough exterior, Iván is a romantic at heart and values meaningful relationships above all else.

It's worth noting that Iván's interests may continue to evolve as he navigates this new chapter in his life with Colette by his side.
