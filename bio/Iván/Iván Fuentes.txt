He has a deep sense of guilt and trauma stemming from his experiences as a member of an elite counter-terrorism unit, particularly the loss of his sister and friends in combat. Despite this, he is determined to move forward and honor his sister's memory without letting her death define him. He also seems to be fiercely independent and self-sufficient, having learned to rely only on himself after being left for dead by his own team.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Iván is of average build, but his height is not specified in the story. However, based on his demeanor and presence, it's likely that he stands around 5'10" to 6'0".
* Eye Color: His eye color is not mentioned, but given his rugged background, it's possible that he has piercing blue or brown eyes.
* Facial Features: Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much detail about Iván's facial features. However, based on his age and occupation, it's likely that he has a strong jawline, piercing gaze, and possibly some scars or marks from his past experiences.

As a former counter-terrorism operative, he is driven by a need to protect others and make amends for past mistakes. He also seems to value honesty and authenticity, as evidenced by his willingness to open up to Sophia about his personal struggles.

It's worth noting that Iván's interests are not explicitly stated in the story, but they can be inferred from his background and actions. His primary focus is on finding closure and justice for himself and those he lost, rather than pursuing traditional hobbies or interests.
