Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Iván Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Iván Kovalenko stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is a dark brown color that often falls across his forehead in messy, artistic splendor. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost indigo, which seems to sparkle with creativity when he's lost in thought. He has a scattering of scars on his cheeks and nose from years of street art, giving him a rugged yet charming appearance.

**Personality:**
Iván Kovalenko is a free-spirited individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. As an artist, he's passionate and expressive, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible with color, texture, and composition. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which has allowed him to thrive in the rough-and-tumble world of street art. Despite this tough exterior, Iván has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand (or spray can) to those around him.

**Interests:**
Iván Kovalenko's interests revolve around art, music, and self-expression. He's a night owl who finds inspiration in the city's streets at dusk and dawn, when the light is soft and magical. When not creating art, he enjoys attending underground concerts and music festivals, where he can lose himself in the rhythm and energy of live performances. Iván is also an avid reader, devouring books on art history, philosophy, and psychology to fuel his creative pursuits.

In terms of specific interests within these areas, Iván has a fascination with abstract expressionism and surrealism, often incorporating elements of these styles into his own work. He's particularly drawn to the works of Russian artists like Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich, who seem to have tapped into the same subconscious forces that drive his own creative process.

Overall, Iván Kovalenko is a creative force to be reckoned with – an artist, musician, and free spirit all rolled into one.
