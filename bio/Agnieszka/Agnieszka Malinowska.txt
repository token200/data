However, she also has a dry sense of humor and can be quick-witted when the situation calls for it.

**Physical Attributes:** Agnieszka stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of training in stealth and combat. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait she inherited from her mother's side of the family. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a ponytail, revealing a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist - a symbol of her allegiance to a mysterious organization known only as "The Order."

**Interests:** Agnieszka is an avid collector of rare artifacts and curiosities, with a particular fascination for ancient relics and historical mysteries. She is also an expert in hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship, having spent years honing her skills in the art of stealth and deception.
