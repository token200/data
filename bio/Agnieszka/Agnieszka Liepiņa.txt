Based on the story "The Grisha Trilogy" by Leigh Bardugo, I've created a summary of Agnieszka Kurowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Personality:** Agnieszka is a diligent and resourceful young woman who takes her responsibilities seriously. She is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or reserved to those who don't know her. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a sharp mind and a strong sense of justice, which motivates her to uncover the truth behind the mysterious events unfolding at the Imperial Palace.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Hair: Long, straight black hair that falls down her back like a waterfall
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a warm undertone, likely due to her Polish heritage
* Build: Petite and athletic, with toned arms and legs from years of dancing and physical labor

**Interests:** Agnieszka is passionate about her work as a palace guard and takes great pride in protecting the Imperial Palace and its guests. She is also an avid student of etiquette, diplomacy, and history, which serves her well in her role as a chaperone at the masquerade ball. In her free time, she enjoys reading, practicing dance movements, and attending concerts. Agnieszka has a deep respect for tradition and protocol, but she is not afraid to break with convention when necessary.

It's worth noting that while Agnieszka is a minor character in "The Grisha Trilogy," she plays an important role in the story, serving as a catalyst for Alina Starkov's journey. Her intelligence, resourcefulness, and unwavering dedication make her a compelling and memorable figure in the series.
