Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Agnieszka Chun-yi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Agnieszka Chun-yi appears to be a skilled and deadly individual with a tough exterior that hides her vulnerabilities. She is resourceful, calculating, and has been trained in the art of stealth and deception from a young age. Her past experiences on the streets of Hong Kong have made her reliant only on herself, suggesting she has developed a strong sense of self-preservation and independence.

**Physical Attributes:** Agnieszka's physical appearance is not extensively described in the story, but we can make some educated guesses based on the context:

* **Height:** Due to her background as an assassin and martial artist, it's likely that Agnieszka is fit and agile, with a slender yet athletic build. Let's assume she stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.
* **Eye Color:** Her eye color is not mentioned in the story, but given her Asian heritage and the name "Chun-yi," it's possible that she has dark brown or black eyes.
* **Other Physical Characteristics:** Agnieszka seems to have a quiet confidence and an air of mystery surrounding her. She may have piercing features, sharp jawlines, and striking facial features that make her blend into the shadows.

**Interests:**

Agnieszka's interests appear to be centered around her work as a skilled assassin and martial artist. Her primary goal is to complete missions and collect payment without questioning the motives of her clients. However, there is an undercurrent of unease in the story suggesting she may have a deeper sense of morality or ethics that she tries to keep hidden.

Her interest in self-preservation and independence suggests she values her freedom above all else. She seems to be driven by a strong desire for financial security and the ability to live life on her own terms, free from the constraints of others.

Despite this focus on self-reliance, there may be hints of a more complex personality hidden beneath her tough exterior. Perhaps Agnieszka has moments of introspection or personal growth that she keeps private from the world.
