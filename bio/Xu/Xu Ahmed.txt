Based on the prompt, I will create a fictional character Xu Ahmed without any suggestive or sexual undertones.

Xu Ahmed is a 28-year-old Chinese-American historian and researcher. He has an athletic build, standing at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet strong physique. His hair is dark brown and usually worn short, revealing his angular facial features. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a perpetual curiosity.

Personality-wise, Xu Ahmed is introspective and thoughtful, often getting lost in his own thoughts as he analyzes historical events or researches new topics. He is fiercely intelligent and has a dry sense of humor, which can sometimes make him appear aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him well. Despite this, he is deeply compassionate and empathetic, particularly when it comes to social justice causes.

In his free time, Xu Ahmed enjoys practicing tai chi, reading classical Chinese literature, and playing the guqin (a traditional Chinese zither). He is also an avid photographer and loves capturing the beauty of urban landscapes and historical sites. Xu's passion for history and culture drives him to explore new places and learn about different perspectives, making him a well-rounded and engaged individual.
