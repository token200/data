If you'd like me to create a story about Xu Pelz, I can suggest a few prompts:

1. "The Lost Workshop of Eldrid": A mysterious map leads Xu Pelz on a quest to find the fabled workshop of an ancient master artisan, rumored to contain long-lost secrets and techniques.
2. "The Lyre's Song": Xu Pelz is approached by a local noble with a request: compose a custom lyre piece for a grand celebration, but he soon realizes that the noble's intentions are not entirely pure.
3. "The Forest of Forged Dreams": A strange phenomenon causes metal and wood to behave erratically in the forest, leading Xu Pelz on a journey to uncover the source of the disturbance.
