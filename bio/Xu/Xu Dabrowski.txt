Based on the short story provided as inspiration from "An Ember in the Ashes" by Sabaa Tahir, I've created a fictional character profile for Xu Dabrowski:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks, reminiscent of the desert sands
* Hair: Dark brown, often tied back in a practical braid or ponytail, reflecting her no-nonsense attitude
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, from spending years under the scorching desert sun

**Personality:**

Xu Dabrowski is a complex and fiercely determined individual. She's driven by her unwavering commitment to the rebel cause and her desire for freedom from Imperial rule. Xu possesses a quiet strength and resilience, forged through countless battles and narrow escapes. Her years of living on the run have taught her to be resourceful, adaptable, and fiercely loyal to those she trusts.

**Interests:**

* Tactics and strategy, honed from years of navigating the complexities of rebellion
* Survival skills, including hunting, foraging, and makeshift repairs
* History, particularly the stories of ancient uprisings against oppressive regimes
* Music, often found in the songs of rebels or soldiers during downtime
* Training with Elias on swordplay, a rare respite from her duties as a rebel leader

**Background:**

Xu Dabrowski's past is marked by loss and struggle. Orphaned at a young age, she was forced to rely on her wits and resourcefulness to survive in the harsh world of Serra. Her skills as a rebel grew from necessity, driven by a deep-seated desire for justice and freedom. As "East Wind," Xu has become a symbol of hope and resilience for many rebels, inspiring them to keep fighting against overwhelming odds.

While this character profile is not an official part of the book series, I've attempted to incorporate elements inspired by Laia from "An Ember in the Ashes" while making adjustments to fit Xu Dabrowski as a unique individual.
