Xu's interests are deeply rooted in his love for his homeland and its people. He is driven by a desire to understand the complexities of Xinjiang's history, geography, and cultures. His adventures are often fueled by his quest for knowledge and his willingness to take risks.

As Xu grew older, he became increasingly fascinated with the stories of his ancestors and the Silk Road that connected them. He spent countless hours studying the maps and charts created by earlier cartographers, seeking to learn more about the vast expanse of Xinjiang and its many mysteries.

Despite the challenges he faced, Xu's curiosity and determination propelled him forward, leading him on a journey that would change the course of his life forever.
