Given that Xu Krūmiņš is not a public figure, I'll opt for the first alternative and create a fictional character profile. Here's a summary of Xu Krūmiņš:

**Name:** Xu Krūmiņš
**Age:** 32
**Nationality:** Latvian (fictional)
**Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)
**Eye Color:** Deep blue

**Personality:** Xu is a introspective and creative individual with a dry sense of humor. He's fiercely independent and values his alone time, often finding solace in the quiet hours of the night to work on his latest artistic endeavors. Despite this, he has a strong sense of loyalty towards those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support them.

**Interests:** Xu is passionate about photography, music, and Latvian folklore. He spends most of his free time capturing the beauty of Latvia's landscapes through his lens or experimenting with traditional folk instruments in his makeshift studio. His love for mythology has also inspired him to create intricate woodcarvings, which often feature mythical creatures from Latvian legends.

**Additional Traits:** Xu is a skilled cook and has a talent for whipping up traditional Latvian dishes like "aukstā kāpostu zupa" (cold beet soup) or "rīgēno pūšītis" (fried rye bread). He's also an avid reader of literary fiction, often getting lost in the works of authors like Aleksandrs Pone and Jānis Rainis.
