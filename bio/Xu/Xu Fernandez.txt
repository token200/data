**Physical Attributes:** Xu Fernandez is a 5'9" (175 cm) tall individual with an athletic build, honed from years of martial arts training. His eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost purple in hue, which sets him apart from those with more common eye colors. His dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, piecey fashion, framing his angular face.

**Personality:** Xu Fernandez is a complex and enigmatic individual. On the surface, he appears calm and collected, with an air of quiet confidence that belies his fierce loyalty to those he cares about. As a skilled fighter and strategist, he is not afraid to take risks and push boundaries, but this comes with a cost: he has a tendency to be intensely introspective and guarded around strangers.

**Interests:** Xu Fernandez has a deep passion for martial arts, particularly the ancient traditions of his homeland. He spends countless hours practicing forms, studying techniques, and perfecting his skills in the art of combat. In addition to this, he is also an avid reader and scholar, with a particular interest in history, philosophy, and mysticism.
