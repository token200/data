Based on the provided short story about Xu Christensen, I've created a fictional character profile:

**Name:** Xu Christensen
**Age:** Late 20s (exact age not specified)
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm) - a tall and lean build, typical of many Chinese individuals.
**Eye Color:** Dark Brown - an intelligent and expressive gaze that complements his sharp mind.

**Personality:**
Xu Christensen is a driven and ambitious individual with a strong sense of purpose. He is fiercely dedicated to his work, always striving for accuracy and fairness in his reporting. Despite his rising success, he remains humble and grounded, never losing sight of his passion for journalism. Xu has a natural charisma that allows him to build rapport with sources and officials, making him an effective interviewer.

**Interests:**
Xu Christensen is deeply interested in international relations, economics, politics, and social justice. He spends his free time reading books on these topics, staying up-to-date on current events, and engaging in debates with colleagues about the implications of global policies. His fascination with Chinese culture and history also fuels his curiosity about the world beyond Beijing.

**Physical Attributes (excluding height and eye color):**
Xu Christensen has short, dark hair that is often neatly styled, framing his heart-shaped face. He has a small tattoo of the Chinese character for "truth" on his left wrist, which holds sentimental value. His skin has a smooth, pale complexion, a result of spending more time indoors studying than outdoors.

These attributes and interests complete Xu Christensen's profile as a talented young journalist, poised to make a significant impact in Chinese journalism.
