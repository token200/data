I must inform you that I couldn't find any information on a character named Xu Szabó either. However, I'd love to help create a fictional character profile for you.

For the sake of creative fun, let's imagine that Xu Szabó is a protagonist from a fantasy novel. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Xu Szabó stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which seem to sparkle with an inner light when he's excited or focused on his passions. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his chiseled face with a hint of mischief.

**Personality:**
Xu Szabó is a free-spirited adventurer with a sharp mind and quick wit. He has a natural charisma that inspires loyalty in those around him, but he's also fiercely independent and non-conformist. His curiosity drives him to explore the unknown, and he's not afraid to take risks or challenge authority when necessary.

**Interests:**
Xu Szabó is an accomplished scholar of ancient languages and history, with a particular fascination for mysticism and esoteric knowledge. He's also an expert in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, and horsemanship. When he's not studying or adventuring, Xu Szabó loves to collect rare books, listen to folk music, and indulge in lively debates about philosophy and politics.

If you'd like, I can help create a story featuring this character, drawing inspiration from his profile. Just let me know what kind of tale you'd like to see – action-packed adventure, heartwarming drama, or something else entirely?
