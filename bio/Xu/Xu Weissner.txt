Based on the provided story about Xu Weissner, I have created a fictional character summary:

**Personality:**
Xu Weissner is a brilliant and reclusive scientist with a dry sense of humor. He is intensely focused on his work, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. Despite this, he has a deep passion for discovery and is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe. Wei is also shown to be somewhat gruff and dismissive of social interactions, but this exterior hides a kinder side that only reveals itself to those closest to him.

**Physical Attributes:**
Xu Weissner is a tall man in his late 40s or early 50s, with an unassuming demeanor. He stands at approximately 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) and has a slender build, which allows him to move freely in the cramped corridors of his laboratory. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those he meets, behind a pair of thick-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose.

**Interests:**
Xu Weissner's primary interest is quantum physics, which has consumed him for most of his adult life. He spends countless hours poring over theories and conducting experiments in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe. Wei is also fascinated by the mysteries of space and time, often losing himself in contemplation of the cosmos. Outside of work, he seems to have little interest in other pursuits or hobbies, preferring to dedicate his free time to furthering his research.

Other details:

- Xu Weissner has a small tattoo of an equilateral triangle on his left wrist, which he got during his graduate studies as a reminder of his own "triangle theory" that revolutionized the field of quantum physics. 
- He is a heavy coffee drinker and consumes at least one cup per hour when working.
- Wei has a strong affinity for old Soviet-era space posters and has an extensive collection of them on his walls.

This summary provides a comprehensive understanding of Xu Weissner's personality, physical appearance, and interests, while also hinting at the depth and complexity that lies beneath his surface.
