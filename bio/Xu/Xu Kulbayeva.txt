Based on the short story about Kalbaeva, I will create a fictional character named Xu Kulbayeva.

**Name:** Xu Kulbayeva

**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s

**Height:** 5'8" (172 cm)

**Eye Color:** Deep brown, almost black, with a hint of green around the iris

**Physical Attributes:** Xu has an athletic build, honed from years of riding horses and engaging in physical activities. Her hair is dark brown, often tied back in a ponytail when she's on horseback or participating in competitions. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, a testament to her Central Asian heritage.

**Personality:** Xu is confident, determined, and fiercely independent. Growing up as the daughter of nomadic parents, she learned to rely on herself and trust her instincts. She is highly adaptable and can think on her feet, making her an excellent competitor in horse riding and archery. Despite her tough exterior, Xu has a compassionate heart and values loyalty and respect above all else.

**Interests:** Xu is passionate about horse breeding and training, often volunteering at local stables to help care for horses in need. She is also an avid archer and enjoys competing in tournaments, both for fun and to test her skills. In her free time, Xu enjoys exploring the vast steppes of Central Asia on horseback, taking in the breathtaking landscapes and immersing herself in the region's rich cultural heritage.

While I've taken inspiration from Kalbaeva's story, Xu Kulbayeva is a distinct character with her own unique personality, interests, and physical attributes.
