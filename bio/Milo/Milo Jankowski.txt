Here is a summary of Milo Jankowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Milo stands at approximately 5'10" with an unassuming build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential solutions to complex problems. His dark hair is often unkempt and mussed, reflecting his tendency to neglect personal grooming when immersed in a project.

**Personality:** Milo is a brilliant and reclusive engineer with an unorthodox approach to problem-solving. He is intensely focused on his work, often becoming completely absorbed in his projects for extended periods of time. Despite his reserved nature, those who know him understand that this is a facade, and that he has an insatiable curiosity and passion for innovation. Milo's humility belies the magnitude of his achievements, and he remains understated about his successes.

**Interests:** Milo is an avid tinkerer with a passion for designing and building innovative gadgets and machines. He spends most of his free time in his cluttered workshop, experimenting with new ideas and testing their feasibility. His interests extend to theoretical physics, engineering, and materials science, making him a well-rounded expert in his field. When not working on projects, Milo enjoys reading scientific papers and attending seminars to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in his field.

**Other Details:** Milo's workshop is a testament to his creativity and resourcefulness. It's cluttered with half-built prototypes, scraps of metal, wires, and other materials that he uses to bring his ideas to life. Despite his reclusive nature, Milo has a keen eye for detail and is not afraid to think outside the box (or in this case, the ship). His dedication to his craft is unwavering, driving him to push the boundaries of what is possible.
