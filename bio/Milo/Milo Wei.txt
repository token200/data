Based on the short story inspiration, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Milo Wei:

**Personality:** Milo is a brilliant and unassuming individual with an unwavering dedication to justice. He is analytical, detail-oriented, and persistent in his pursuit of truth. Despite his intelligence and expertise, he is not one to seek the spotlight or boast about his accomplishments. Instead, he works tirelessly behind the scenes, driven by a strong sense of morality and a desire to uncover hidden truths.

**Physical Attributes:** Milo has short, dark hair that is often unkempt and worn in a utilitarian style. His eyes are piercing brown, with an intensity that can seem unnerving when directed at someone accused. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which may be slightly above average height for a man of Asian descent.

**Interests:** Milo is deeply interested in law, justice, and the intersection of technology and society. His work as a prosecutor has given him a unique perspective on the ways in which algorithms and AI can shape public opinion, which he finds both fascinating and disturbing. Outside of his professional life, it's unlikely that Milo enjoys hobbies or leisure activities that might be considered "typical" for someone with his interests. However, he is likely to have an appreciation for books, documentaries, and podcasts related to law, ethics, and technology.

It's worth noting that while the story doesn't provide a wealth of personal details about Milo, it does suggest that he has a dry sense of humor (colleagues laugh at him) and may be introverted or reserved in social situations.
