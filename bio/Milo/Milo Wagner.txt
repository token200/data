**Personality:** Milo appears to be a quiet, introspective person who is deeply passionate about storytelling, exploration, and collecting rare books. He seems to be drawn to like-minded individuals who share his interests, as evident from his connection with Emma at the caf√©.

To fill in these gaps and create a more well-rounded picture, let's assume additional characteristics:
