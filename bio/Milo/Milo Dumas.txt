Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Milo Dumas:

**Personality:** Milo Dumas is a ruggedly intelligent and resourceful individual with a strong sense of purpose. He has a natural inclination towards danger and the unknown, which he developed during his time in the French Foreign Legion as a surveillance expert. After leaving the military, he found himself restless and searching for a new challenge. His willingness to take risks and adapt to uncertain situations makes him a skilled treasure hunter.

**Physical Attributes:** Milo Dumas is likely in his mid-to-late thirties, with an athletic build honed from years of physical training in the Legion. He stands around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often mussed and unkempt, giving him a rough-around-the-edges appearance.

**Interests:** Milo's primary interest lies in treasure hunting and uncovering the unknown. He has a natural talent for tracking down rare artifacts and piecing together cryptic clues. This fascination stems from his time in the French Foreign Legion, where he was trained to observe and analyze the world around him. Outside of his work as a treasure hunter, Milo enjoys exploring the city streets of Paris at night, often taking on solo missions that allow him to hone his skills.

Additional details: It's possible that Milo has some experience with martial arts or self-defense training from his time in the Legion, which would make him well-equipped to handle unexpected situations. His ability to blend into crowds and remain unnoticed is also a valuable asset for his line of work. Despite his tough exterior, there may be hints of vulnerability or introspection lurking beneath Milo's surface, suggesting that he has a deeper emotional life than initially meets the eye.
