Based on the provided short story inspiration, here is a summary of Milo Weber's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Milo is an introspective and empathetic individual. As a child, he was often lost in thought due to his ability to hear whispers from inanimate objects, which made him more inclined to observe the world around him rather than engage with others. However, as he grew older, he began to crave genuine connections with people, tired of being treated like a curiosity. He is creative, intuitive, and values depth over superficial interactions.

**Physical Attributes:** Milo stands at about 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an unassuming presence that belies his unique gift. His eyes are a deep brown color, often cast downward in contemplation as he listens to the whispers of old things. He has unruly brown hair that falls across his forehead, giving him a slightly tousled appearance.

**Interests:** As an antique restorer and someone who can hear the whispers of inanimate objects, Milo's interests revolve around understanding the history and stories behind each piece. He is fascinated by the past, particularly those moments when people used to interact with these items on a daily basis. When not working on his craft or exploring old buildings, Milo enjoys listening to classical music (especially piano pieces), reading about historical events, and learning new languages.

While his unique gift gives him access to knowledge that others can only dream of, it also brings an air of isolationism to his life. He values finding someone like Elara who accepts him for who he is – a little weird – and can appreciate the complexities of his existence.
