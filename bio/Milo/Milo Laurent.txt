Here is a summary of the fictional character Milo Laurent's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Milo Laurent is a determined and empathetic detective with a strong sense of justice. She has a keen instinct for reading people and situations, which serves her well in her line of work. Her years of experience have also given her a tough exterior, but she is not immune to the emotional toll of cases like Emily's disappearance.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8"
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark brown, shoulder-length

Milo appears to be an attractive woman with a slender build. Her hazel eyes seem to see right through to the heart of the matter, while her dark hair frames her face and adds depth to her overall presence.

**Interests:** As a seasoned detective, Milo is naturally drawn to puzzles and mysteries. She has a keen analytical mind and enjoys piecing together seemingly unrelated clues to uncover the truth. Outside of work, she is an avid reader and enjoys true crime stories and psychological thrillers. Her own sister's disappearance as a teenager still haunts her, driving her passion for solving cases like Emily's.

In terms of hobbies, Milo may not have much time for leisure activities outside of work, but if she did, it's likely that she would enjoy writing (perhaps even a book about her investigative experiences), practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being, or taking long walks in nature to clear her mind.
