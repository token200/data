Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Milo HÃ©bert:

**Personality:** Milo appears to be a complex individual with a stoic exterior. He has an ability to pierce through Emma's facade and reveal glimpses of his true self, suggesting that he is introspective and possibly vulnerable. Despite this, he maintains a reserve that makes him appear unfazed or even uncomfortable in social situations.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: 6 feet (1.83 meters)
- Eye Color: Hazel

These details are not explicitly mentioned in the story but can be inferred from the description of Emma's reactions to Milo's presence and demeanor. The subtle connection they share when their eyes meet suggests a certain level of emotional resonance, which could imply that his physical appearance has some impact on her perception.

**Interests:** Unfortunately, there is no information provided about Milo's interests in the short story. However, given his ability to form connections with Emma and be drawn into conversations despite his initial reluctance, it can be inferred that he might have intellectual or emotional interests that align with hers, making their encounters not just mundane exchanges but rather opportunities for shared understanding and connection.

The character's depth, particularly his inner life and emotions, remains somewhat elusive due to the nature of the story. Nevertheless, through the brief glimpses provided by Emma's reactions, we can infer a strong potential for emotional complexity and vulnerability beneath Milo's seemingly tough exterior.
