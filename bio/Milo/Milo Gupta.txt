His love of chess is evident, as he can outmaneuver even seasoned opponents with ease.

* His family background suggests a supportive and nurturing environment, with parents who encouraged his curiosity and intellect.
* As a child, Milo was fascinated by the world of codes and ciphers, which sparked his interest in cryptography as an adult.
