Søren is also deeply introspective and contemplative, often losing himself in thought as he gazes out at the natural world. He has a profound respect for the land and its secrets, and he is attuned to its whispers (as suggested by the fjord's mysterious voice in his ear). This spiritual connection gives him a sense of purpose and belonging that goes beyond his professional accomplishments.

Søren's interests are deeply intertwined with his work as an architect, but they also extend beyond the realm of his professional life. He is a curious and thoughtful individual who seeks to understand the world around him, and he is always looking for ways to improve it.
