His eyes are an intense blue, almost piercing in their intensity, which seems to gleam with an inner spark when he's immersed in his art. His features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a determined jawline that speaks to his strong will and artistic drive.

He is passionate about exploring the complexities of human existence through his work, often incorporating elements of theatre, dance, and visual arts into his installations. His fascination with the fragmented self – a central theme in "The Fragmented Self" – suggests an interest in psychology, philosophy, and anthropology.
