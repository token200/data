Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Søren Adelberg's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Søren appears to be introverted and emotionally guarded, at least on the surface. He has a polished exterior as a successful businessman, but beneath this façade lies a deep sense of emptiness and disconnection. As he opens up to the mysterious woman, his guard drops, and we see glimpses of vulnerability and a desire for connection. Despite his reserved nature, Søren is drawn to someone who understands him on a deep level.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Sandy blond (unlike the woman's chestnut brown hair, which frames her face)

While we don't have a detailed description of Søren's physical appearance in the short story, I've filled in some gaps based on his age and profession as a successful businessman. The sandy blond color may indicate that he has lost some of his youthful vitality or is trying to appear more approachable than his actual nature.

**Interests:** Although we don't see Søren engaging in specific activities or hobbies beyond his professional life, it can be inferred that he enjoys:

* Art: He attended an art gallery opening and met the mysterious woman there.
* Intellectual pursuits: His conversations with the woman suggest a depth of understanding and insight into complex ideas.

These interests likely complement his more reserved personality, suggesting that Søren values meaningful connections and intellectual stimulation over material possessions or superficial social interactions.
