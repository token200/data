Søren is a introspective and nostalgic individual who values connection and community. He has an insatiable desire for experience and meaning, which drove him to leave his hometown in search of adventure and success. However, upon returning to Aarhus, he realizes that sometimes it's okay to settle into the present and appreciate the comfort of familiarity. Søren is also shown to be introspective and philosophical, as evident from his conversations with Lars about existentialism.

As for eye color, it's implied that Søren has brown eyes, as they are mentioned alongside the smell of Jørgensen's fish market, which evokes a sense of familiarity and nostalgia.

**Interests:**

This suggests that music holds a special place in his heart and is an outlet for him to express himself creatively. Additionally, Søren appears to appreciate the comfort of nostalgia, often finding solace in familiar smells, sounds, and people from his past.
