Here's a summary of Søren Dupuis' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Søren is an introspective and emotional person who has retreated from the world after experiencing a deep loss. He is consumed by his thoughts and memories, often getting lost in what-ifs and analyzing every detail of his past. Despite this, he is not antisocial and values solitude over human connection, which can make him come across as mysterious or even aloof to those who don't know him.

However, as the story progresses, it's revealed that Søren has a deep capacity for emotional connection and vulnerability. He is haunted by his past and still grieving the loss of Léa, but he is also capable of feeling empathy and compassion towards others. When Colette re-enters his life, she helps him to reconnect with the world and find new meaning.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, Søren's physical appearance is not extensively described. However, we can make some inferences based on the setting of his apartment and his daily activities:

* Height: Søren is likely a bit on the slender side, given that he can spend hours sitting alone with a cup of coffee.
* Eye Color: His eye color is unknown, but it's possible that it's a deep brown or blue, given the French setting and his introspective nature.
* Hair: His hair color is also not specified, but it could be dark brown or black, reflecting his introspective personality.

**Interests:** Søren's interests are primarily centered around books and knowledge. He has amassed a collection of old books and dusty artifacts in his apartment, suggesting that he values intellectual pursuits and is deeply curious about the world.

His love for books is not just superficial; it serves as a way for him to escape the pain of his past and explore new ideas and perspectives. However, even this coping mechanism is limited by his grief, which prevents him from fully immersing himself in the words of great authors.

As Søren begins to reconnect with Colette, he starts to re-discover his passion for life beyond books, including watching the stars with her on the balcony and exploring the city.
