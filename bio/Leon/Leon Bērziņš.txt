**Personality:**
Leon is a introspective and sentimental person. He values his Latvian heritage deeply and has always felt a strong connection to his roots. However, after years abroad, he became disconnected from his identity and had to navigate the challenges of finding himself again. Leon is determined, resourceful, and determined to reconnect with his family and community.

**Interests:**

He enjoys traditional Latvian cuisine, folk music, and dance. In his free time, Leon likes to explore Riga's hidden gems, visit museums, and attend cultural events.

**Additional Traits:**

As mentioned in the story, Leon spent years studying and working abroad before returning to Latvia to reconnect with his roots.
