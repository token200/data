**Physical Attributes:** Leon García Fernández stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that gives him a slightly unkempt look.

He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which he got during a childhood accident.
