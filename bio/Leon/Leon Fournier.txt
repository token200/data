Here's a summary of Leon Fournier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leon is a curious and adventurous individual with an innate thirst for mystery and the unknown. He has always been drawn to puzzles and unsolved mysteries, which motivates him to take risks and push boundaries. His habit of carrying a pistol and notebook indicates that he values preparation and self-reliance. Despite his rugged exterior, Leon likely has a dry sense of humor and a hint of vulnerability.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic

**Interests:** Leon is deeply interested in the unknown, the unexplained, and the paranormal. He likely has a strong background in research and investigation, with a particular focus on cryptography, folklore, and the occult. His love for mystery novels and his own notebooks suggest that he also enjoys reading about true crime cases and cryptic messages.

Given these details, it's possible to imagine Leon as a lone wolf, preferring to work alone rather than in teams. His experience with Professor Thaddeus might have left him feeling slightly isolated or disconnected from others, which could be why he's particularly drawn to the company of Sophia, despite his initial wariness.
