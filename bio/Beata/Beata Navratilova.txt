Based on the provided short story about Martina Navratilova, I've created a fictional character profile for Beata Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Skin Tone: Fair with a subtle scattering of freckles across her cheeks

**Personality:**
Beata is an outgoing and determined individual, much like Martina Navratilova. She's fiercely competitive and driven to succeed in everything she pursues. Her strong work ethic and perseverance have earned her the respect of her peers and mentors alike.

**Interests:**

* Tennis (of course!)
* Hiking and outdoor activities
* Cooking and trying new recipes from around the world
* Reading classic literature and biographies of influential women
* Volunteering at local youth sports programs to inspire young athletes

While I've taken creative liberties with Beata's profile, she embodies many qualities that are reminiscent of Martina Navratilova's remarkable personality and achievements.
