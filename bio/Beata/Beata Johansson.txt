**Personality:** Beata is a creative and passionate individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is a hard worker and is deeply committed to her craft as a baker. Despite her talent and success in the kitchen, Beata has a vulnerable side, having recently gone through a rough breakup. This has left her feeling uncertain and stuck, but also determined to move forward.

In addition to baking, Beata enjoys spending time with friends and family, practicing yoga, and exploring the city of Stockholm.

**Background:** Beata grew up in a small town just outside of Stockholm, where she spent countless hours watching her mother bake and develop a love for the art of cooking.

Despite her success, Beata is still trying to navigate her personal life after a recent breakup.

**Strengths:** Beata is creative, determined, and passionate about her work. She is also fiercely loyal to those she cares about, particularly Mrs. Lindström, who has become like a mentor to her.
