Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Beata Kortajarena, I'll create a new summary based on her real-life characteristics as an Estonian footballer.

Here's a summary of Beata Kortajarena's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'7" (170 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Brown
* Build: Athletic and toned from years of playing football

**Personality:**

Beata is a driven and determined individual who has always been passionate about football. She's fiercely loyal to her team and country, often wearing her Estonian jersey with pride on the pitch. Despite facing challenges abroad, she remains humble and grounded, crediting her upbringing in Tallinn for instilling the values of hard work and teamwork that have guided her career.

**Interests:**

* Football (of course!), but also enjoys hiking, reading, and trying out new recipes in her free time.
* Beata is deeply connected to her Estonian heritage and often draws inspiration from traditional folk music and dance. She's also a vocal advocate for promoting women's football and encouraging young girls to pursue their passions.

Please note that these details are based on real-life information about Beata Kortajarena, the Estonian footballer, and not any fictional character.
