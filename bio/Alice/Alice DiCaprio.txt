Since I couldn't find any public information on a person named Alice DiCaprio, I will create a fictional character inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio.

Name: Alice DiCaprio

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - slightly taller than the average height for men
- Eye Color: Bright blue, with a hint of green around the iris, reminiscent of Leonardo DiCaprio's piercing blue eyes
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in loose waves framing her face

Personality:
Alice is an adventurous and determined individual, inherited from her famous actor brother. She has a curious mind and a strong sense of justice, driving her to pursue her passion for botany. Alice is a natural leader, able to inspire trust and confidence in those around her, much like her brother's ability to command the screen.

As a renowned botanist, Alice DiCaprio exudes a quiet confidence in her field, having spent years studying the unique properties of Amazonian flora. She is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused on her work, often becoming completely absorbed in her research. However, this intensity belies a dry sense of humor and a deep empathy for those she encounters, making her a beloved figure among her colleagues.

Interests:
- Botany: Alice's true passion lies in exploring the vast diversity of plant life, with an emphasis on discovering new species and uncovering their unique properties.
- Conservation: Alice is deeply committed to protecting the Amazon rainforest and preserving its delicate ecosystem for future generations.
- Environmental activism: As a strong advocate for environmental causes, Alice uses her platform to raise awareness about the importance of preserving our planet's natural resources.

Background:
Alice DiCaprio was born in New York City to a family of artists. Her parents encouraged her early interests in botany and exploration, sending her on solo expeditions to explore local parks and forests. This sparked her passion for adventure and discovery, which eventually led her to pursue a career in botany. With a strong educational background and extensive research experience, Alice DiCaprio is now recognized as a leading expert in the field of Amazonian botany.
