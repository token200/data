**Interests:** As a con artist, Alice's interests are likely centered around manipulation and deception. However, it appears that she may have a more nuanced interest in human connection and relationships. Her hesitation when confronted with the prospect of scamming Marcus suggests that she may be drawn to genuine connections and relationships, rather than purely transactional ones.
