Here is a summary of Alice Fournier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alice Fournier is a sentimental and introspective person. She has a strong connection to her past and values the comfort of familiar traditions. Her love for antique shops and family heirlooms suggests that she is sentimental and appreciative of the stories and memories behind each item. Despite this, Alice seems to be at peace with herself and finds solace in the quiet contemplation of old objects.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical descriptions provided in the original short story, so I will make some educated guesses:

* Age: Late 20s or early 30s
* Height: 5'6" (168 cm) - a slender yet elegant figure
* Eye Color: Hazel or green - a soft, earthy tone that complements her introspective nature

**Interests:** Alice Fournier is deeply passionate about antique shops and vintage items. She finds comfort in the dusty, forgotten memories within these treasures, which often evoke stories from her own family's past. Her interest in music boxes, in particular, suggests a love for nostalgia and sentimental trinkets.

It's worth noting that Alice's personality and interests are more abstract than physical attributes can capture. Her connection to the past, love for antique shops, and fondness for music boxes are all emotional and experiential aspects of her character, which are harder to quantify or describe with words alone.
