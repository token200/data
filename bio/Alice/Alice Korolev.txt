Here's a summary of Alice Korolev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alice is a curious and determined individual. Having grown up feeling like an outsider due to her parents' presumed death, she has developed a strong sense of resilience and adaptability. She is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo in pursuit of truth and answers about her past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks, a trait inherited from her Russian heritage
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a messy bob
* Build: Slender yet athletic, reflecting her love of hiking and outdoor activities

**Interests:** Alice is passionate about history, particularly the Cold War era and the world of espionage. She has always been fascinated by stories of double agents, secret societies, and the lives of people living on the fringes of society.

As she delves deeper into her past, Alice becomes increasingly interested in:

* Genealogy: Uncovering hidden family histories and tracing connections to those who were thought to be lost or deceased.
* Spy fiction: Reading books and watching movies about espionage and covert operations, seeing parallels between her own life and the stories of others.
* Cultural exploration: Immersing herself in foreign languages, customs, and traditions, as she navigates a new city and culture.

These interests will likely shape Alice's adventures as she uncovers secrets about her past and forges connections with those who can help her find her place in the world.
