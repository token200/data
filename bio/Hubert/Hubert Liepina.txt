Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Hubert Liepina:

**Personality:** Hubert is a man of mystery, enigmatic smile, and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. He is intelligent and perceptive, with an understanding of the human experience. Despite his efforts to keep a low profile, he has a deep sense of passion and integrity when it comes to art. He is also introspective, having spent years hiding his true identity as an art forger.

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert is of average height (around 5'9"), with a slender yet athletic build. His piercing blue eyes are a striking feature, seeming to see right through those he meets. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his air of mystery. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which suggests a past marred by danger.

**Interests:** Hubert's interests are deeply rooted in art. As an art conservator, he spends most of his days restoring vintage paintings to their former glory. He is meticulous and patient, taking pride in every brushstroke and every detail that brings a masterpiece back to life. When not working on restorations, he enjoys browsing through the works of famous artists, searching for inspiration and insight into the human experience.

In addition to art, Hubert has a deep fascination with history, particularly the 19th century. He is an avid reader of literature, devouring books on art history, philosophy, and psychology. He also has a weakness for antique furniture, collectibles, and rare artifacts, which he buys whenever possible.

Despite his refined tastes, Hubert is not one for luxury or extravagance. He lives modestly in the small, quirky gallery on the Left Bank where Marcel, the owner, kindly took him under his wing. His love of art and history brings him joy and fulfillment, even as he continues to navigate the complexities of his past.
