His reserved nature gradually gives way to warmth and enthusiasm as he opens up to Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert is a tall and slender man, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an unassuming demeanor. His eyes are a piercing brown that seem to hold a thousand years of knowledge. He has long, dark hair often tied back in a simple knot, framing his pale face.

**Interests:** Hubert's primary interests lie in the realm of history and literature, with an encyclopedic knowledge spanning centuries. He spends most of his days lost in the pages of ancient tomes, poring over dusty manuscripts, and devouring obscure texts. His love for solitude is only matched by his passion for sharing his vast knowledge with those who can appreciate it.
