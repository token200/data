Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Hubert Lacis:

**Personality:** Hubert Lacis is portrayed as a man of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence. He is fiercely intelligent and has exceptional skills as a detective, which earns him a reputation as the go-to investigator in town. His stern demeanor suggests that he is not afraid to speak his mind and can be intimidating to those who cross him. Despite this, he seems to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by the small smile playing on his lips when solving the case.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Hubert Lacis's physical appearance. However, based on his demeanor and behavior, it can be inferred that he is likely in his mid-to-late adulthood, possibly around 40-50 years old. His height is unknown, but given his slender presence at the door of Lady Harrington's mansion, he may be slightly above average height.

As for eye color, it's not explicitly mentioned, but considering his reserved and introspective nature, it's possible that he has piercing or deep-set eyes that seem to bore into those he interrogates. His hair is also unknown, but if we consider his reclusive lifestyle and lack of attention to social appearances, it's possible that he keeps his locks neatly trimmed and understated.

**Interests:** Hubert Lacis appears to be a man of little interest in superficial social pursuits, preferring instead to focus on solving complex cases. He is drawn to puzzles and mysteries, and his exceptional analytical mind allows him to piece together seemingly unrelated details to uncover the truth. His investigation into Lady Harrington's case showcases his skills as a detective, but it also suggests that he has a deep-seated passion for justice and uncovering the secrets of those around him.

Outside of his work, it's unclear what Hubert Lacis enjoys doing in his free time. Given his reclusive nature, it's possible that he prefers solitary activities or focuses on self-improvement through reading and intellectual pursuits. However, with a reputation as the go-to detective in town, it's likely that he is often called upon to solve cases outside of his personal life, leaving little room for leisure activities.
