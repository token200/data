Based on the short story, here is a summary of Hubert Brown's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Hubert is a passionate and creative individual with a strong sense of frustration towards the more mundane aspects of life, particularly gardening shows on television. He values individuality and originality, which is reflected in his disdain for neatly manicured gardens. Despite this, he is kind, appreciative, and enthusiastic about sharing his love for plants with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert's height is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it can be inferred that he is a relatively slender person, possibly in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. His eye color is described as "normal" or "unremarkable," suggesting that he may have brown eyes.

**Interests:** Hubert's primary interest is botany, and he has spent years cultivating and experimenting with various plant species in his greenhouse. He is particularly drawn to the unique and exotic, and enjoys pushing the boundaries of what can be done with plants. In addition to botany, Hubert also has an artistic side and is collaborating with a local artist on a living sculpture project that showcases his beloved plants in a creative and innovative way.

It's worth noting that some details about Hubert's physical attributes, such as his height, are left unclear in the original story, so I've made educated guesses based on the context.
