Here is a summary of Hubert Gómez Pérez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His dark brown eyes seem to gleam with intelligence behind a pair of wire-framed glasses perched on the end of his nose. His jet-black hair is often tousled, and he sports a scruffy beard that adds to his rugged charm.

**Personality:** Hubert's wit and cunning are matched only by his charisma. He has an effortless air of confidence that commands attention and inspires trust in those around him. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for underdogs, often taking on jobs that benefit the greater good rather than just lining his own pockets. This empathy makes him an exceptional con artist, as he can read people's vulnerabilities like a book.

**Interests:** Hubert is an avid reader of history and folklore, which fuels his fascination with ancient artifacts and mysterious tales. He has a particular fondness for stories about cursed places and objects, often seeking them out as a challenge or to understand the reasoning behind their supposed "hauntings." Outside of his work, he enjoys playing chess and sipping fine whiskey, often lost in thought after a long day's work.

* Hubert likely has a few scars on his hands and face from past escapades.
