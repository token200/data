He is known for his exceptional attention to detail, his ability to listen attentively, and his passion for sharing knowledge and ideas with others. Hubert's demeanor is gentle yet assertive, making him a natural mediator and host to some of the most influential minds of his time.

He is also deeply fascinated by literature, philosophy, and art, often engaging in lively debates with his patrons about the intersections between creativity, culture, and politics.

Hubert's interests extend beyond the realm of intellectual pursuits, however. He has a deep appreciation for music, enjoying the works of Debussy and Ravel, which he finds evoke the same sense of elegance and refinement as a perfectly crafted cup of coffee.
