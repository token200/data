Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Hubert Harris's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Hubert Harris is a reclusive scientist with a brilliant mind, but also a prickly demeanor. He is likely introverted and prefers to keep to himself, preferring to interact only through emails or in rare instances, such as the meeting with Emily. Despite his reserved nature, there's an intensity and depth to his personality that allows him to see right through others' defenses. His eyes seem to hold a mysterious quality, hinting at a complexity beyond his rugged exterior.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: Approximately 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm), possibly with a slightly stooped posture due to years of intense focus on his work.
- Eye Color: A piercing blue that seems almost unnerving, yet simultaneously draws you in. This color could be an unusual shade, perhaps even a deep, dark blue with a hint of gray.

Interests:
Hubert is intensely focused on quantum mechanics and spends most of his time studying, experimenting, and tinkering with complex equipment in his flat. His interests are deeply rooted in understanding the fundamental laws of physics, and he seems driven by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of the universe.

As a person outside of academia, it's difficult to pinpoint Hubert's broader interests beyond science. However, given his passion for quantum mechanics, it's likely that he enjoys activities related to physics, such as attending lectures or conferences, reading scientific papers, and engaging in discussions with fellow experts.
