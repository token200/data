Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Hubert M채kinen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Hubert M채kinen is a Finnish-born craftsman in his mid-to-late 40s or 50s. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall and has a rugged, outdoorsy appearance that complements his bushy beard and wild mane of curly hair. His eyes are a piercing blue color with a knowing glint that hints at years of experience in the craft.

**Personality:**
Hubert M채kinen is a creative force to be reckoned with - he's fiercely dedicated, innovative, and always pushing the boundaries of what's possible in his art form. Despite his growing fame, he remains humble and committed to his craft above all else, which inspires loyalty and admiration from those around him. He has a wry sense of humor and enjoys teasing others (as evidenced by his response to the young apprentice's awe-struck gaze).

**Interests:**
Hubert M채kinen is passionate about woodworking, particularly traditional Finnish techniques combined with modern flair. He spends countless hours in his workshop experimenting with new designs, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with wood and steel. He's also interested in Swedish flora and design, as evident from his stunning cabinet adorned with intricate carvings of Swedish plants. Outside of work, he likely enjoys spending time outdoors in nature, possibly practicing traditional Finnish crafts like birch bark weaving or skiing.

It's worth noting that some attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the short story, so I've made educated guesses based on the narrative and the character's personality.
