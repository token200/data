Despite her success, she is a reclusive individual who prefers to keep a low profile, rarely giving interviews or attending public events.

Hubert is passionate about science, but also deeply emotional and empathetic.

However, she can be fiercely guarded when it comes to her personal life and may come across as aloof or distant to those who do not know her.

Despite her introverted tendencies, Hubert Askarova is also a talented musician who plays the violin in her spare time. Music is a source of comfort and inspiration for her, and she often uses it to relax and unwind after a long day of work.
