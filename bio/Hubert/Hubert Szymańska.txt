Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Hubert Szymańska:

**Personality:** Hubert Szymańska is a quiet and introspective person who has become even more reserved since his wife's passing. However, as he opens up to Kasia, it becomes clear that he is complex and has a rich inner world. Despite his initial reluctance to speak, Hubert has a gentle and caring nature, particularly when it comes to his garden and the plants in it.

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert is an older man, with grey hair likely to be balding at the top of his head. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, which is slightly above average height. His eyes are a deep brown color that hold a thousand stories, as suggested in the story. They are often cast downward or focused on something else, suggesting that Hubert has been introspective and lost in thought.

**Interests:** Hubert's primary interest is his garden, where he spends most of his days tending to his roses and other plants. He takes great care and attention to detail, indicating a love for nature and a desire to nurture life. In addition to gardening, Hubert enjoys quiet, contemplative activities such as watching the sunset or sipping tea.

It's worth noting that we don't have much information about Hubert's interests outside of his garden, so this summary is based on the limited information provided in the short story.
