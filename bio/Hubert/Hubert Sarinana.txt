Despite his humility, he is confident in his abilities and has a unique perspective on the world.

**Physical Attributes:**

**Interests:** Hubert is deeply fascinated by human relationships and social behavior. He spends most of his free time observing people in public places, such as parks or cafes, where he can collect data on group dynamics. He is also an avid reader of psychology and sociology texts, always seeking to expand his knowledge of the human mind.

In addition to these interests, Hubert enjoys long walks in the park, particularly by the lake, where he can reflect on his findings and think critically about social behavior. He is a bit of a daydreamer and often loses himself in thought, but this allows him to stay observant and insightful.
