**Personality:** Hubert is an enigmatic and introverted individual with a passion for his work. He is brilliant and eccentric, but also reclusive, preferring the company of his equations and experiments to that of others. Despite this, he has a way of inspiring devotion in those around him, as evident from his students' rapt attention during lectures.

**Physical Attributes:** Hubert's physical attributes are not extensively described, but based on the story, we can infer some details:

* Height: Hubert is likely of average height for an adult male. The text does not provide a specific measurement, but it suggests that he moves with ease through his labyrinthine laboratory.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, there is no mention of Hubert's eye color in the provided story. We can only speculate about its color based on typical descriptions of intelligent and eccentric individuals.

**Interests:** Hubert's interests are centered around physics, particularly quantum mechanics, and engineering. He has a fascination with clockwork mechanisms and sees connections between these seemingly unrelated fields. His work often involves tinkering with devices like the antique clockwork mechanism he was developing when Emma stumbled upon his laboratory.
