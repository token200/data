Based on the fictional story about Reinhard Schaal and Rein Saldana, I've created a character profile for Rein Saldana:

**Name:** Rein Saldana (likely inspired by German-American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose first name is spelled "Rein" in some languages)

**Personality:** Rein Saldana is a resourceful and intelligent ally who shares a strong sense of justice with his friend Captain America's old acquaintance, Reinhard Schaal. He's quick-witted and able to think on his feet, often helping the team escape sticky situations. Rein has a calm demeanor, which allows him to remain composed under pressure.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Blue-Grey
- Hair Color: Dark Brown
- Build: Lean and athletic

Rein's physical attributes suggest he's well-suited for stealthy missions and agile combat.
