However, as she reconnects with Emma and begins to share her story, it becomes clear that she is also resilient, determined, and capable of forming deep connections with others.

* Exploring and reconnecting with nature (e.g., walking through the woods, playing soccer in the park)
* Learning about her past and sharing her story
