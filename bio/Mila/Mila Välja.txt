Mila Välja is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often finding solace in the silence and solitude that comes with photography. She's intensely curious about the world and its secrets, often spending hours lost in thought as she wanders the streets of Pärnu.

**Interests:**

Mila Välja is passionate about photography, which serves as an outlet for her creative energy and allows her to capture the beauty of the world. Her love for Estonian folk songs and melodies still resonates within her, though she rarely sings or plays music herself. Instead, these sounds become an accompaniment to her photographs, a subtle background hum that underscores the emotions and moods she's trying to convey.

In addition to photography, Mila Välja is deeply fascinated by the stories and histories hidden within Pärnu's landscapes. She spends hours researching and exploring abandoned structures like the lighthouse she discovered in this short story, uncovering secrets about the town's past that few people know.

Her connection to nature, light, and shadow makes her an artist who finds inspiration in the world around her – be it the sweeping horizons of Pärnu or the intricate patterns found within the natural world.
