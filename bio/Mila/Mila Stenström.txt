Here's a summary of Mila Stenstr√∂m's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Mila appears to be an introverted and curious person who is deeply passionate about history, particularly the stories of old Sweden. She has a strong sense of nostalgia and a connection to her heritage, which is evident in her love for restoring antique objects like her wooden boat. Her curiosity gets the better of her when she meets Lena, and she is eager to learn more about their shared family legacy.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Mila's height is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it can be inferred that she is likely a petite young woman, possibly in her early twenties.
* Eye Color: Although the story doesn't mention Mila's eye color, it implies that she has eyes similar to the gray or blue eyes often associated with Scandinavian women. However, since there are no descriptions of her eyes, I will leave this attribute open for interpretation.

**Interests:** Mila's interests include:

* History, particularly Swedish history and folklore
* Restoring antique objects, such as her wooden boat and books bound in worn leather
* Learning about her family's heritage and legacy
* Exploring the connection between her own ancestry and that of legendary Viking queens
* Nostalgia for old Sweden and its culture

It's worth noting that Mila's character is still somewhat fictionalized, and these attributes are based on the short story provided. However, I've tried to create a cohesive profile that captures the essence of her personality, physical characteristics, and interests.
