Here is a summary of Alba Sandström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alba Sandström is a fearless and dogged journalist with a sharp mind and quick wit. She is undeterred by obstacles and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. Her reputation for being reckless and impulsive may precede her, but she knows that it's a small price to pay for pursuing justice. Alba is fiercely independent and values her autonomy as a journalist, often taking on cases that others deem too difficult or sensitive.

**Physical Attributes:** Alba Sandström stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of working long hours at the news desk. Her eyes are piercing green, a trait she inherited from her Swedish heritage. Her short, dark hair is often styled in a practical bob that allows for maximum focus on her work. She has a small nose ring and a few tattoos on her arms, which she sees as a way to express herself outside of the confines of the newsroom.

**Interests:** Outside of journalism, Alba Sandström has a passion for investigative research and analysis. She is an avid reader of historical texts and contemporary literature, devouring books on politics, economics, and social justice. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to clear her mind and stay focused. Alba also has a secret love for 80s music and often listens to David Bowie or The Cure while working late nights.
