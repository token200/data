Here is a summary of Alba Gupta's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alba is a brilliant and fiercely independent astrophysicist with a strong sense of determination and drive. She is passionate about her work and has a deep-seated desire to understand the mysteries of the universe. However, her relentless focus on her career has taken a toll on her personal relationships, making her come across as aloof or distant to those who don't know her well. Despite this, she is deeply compassionate and empathetic, particularly when it comes to matters related to her research.

**Physical Attributes:** Alba is of Indian descent, with dark hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep brown, almond-shaped, and fringed with thick lashes that give them an otherworldly allure. She stands at about 5'8" (173 cm), which she often jokes is due to her father's attempts to feed her more naan bread as a child. Her features are delicate yet striking, giving her an ethereal quality that belies her sharp intellect and strong will.

**Interests:** Alba's primary interest is in astrophysics, particularly in the study of cosmic phenomena and the underlying structure of the universe. She is deeply fascinated by the mysteries of black holes, dark matter, and the origins of the universe itself. Her passion for her work often leads her to explore unconventional theories and approaches, which can sometimes put her at odds with her more traditional colleagues.

Beyond astrophysics, Alba has a strong interest in Eastern philosophy, particularly Hinduism, which is reflected in her family's cultural heritage. She finds solace in the teachings of ancient texts, such as the one she discovered that changed her perspective on her research and her place within the universe.

In her free time, Alba enjoys stargazing, reading about mythology and cosmology, and practicing yoga to maintain balance in her life. Her love for music is also evident, particularly classical Indian compositions, which evoke a sense of serenity and peace that she finds hard to replicate in her busy academic life.
