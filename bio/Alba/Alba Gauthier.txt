Here is a summary of the fictional character Alba Gauthier:

Physical Attributes: Alba stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, which she maintains through regular workouts and a disciplined diet. Her striking features include piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets, as well as long, curly raven-black hair that frames her heart-shaped face.

Personality: Alba is a complex and multifaceted individual with a razor-sharp wit and tongue. She has a polished exterior that hides a tumultuous soul, marked by a trail of broken relationships, failed ventures, and a penchant for manipulation. Her sharp intellect and quick thinking have earned her the reputation as one of the most cunning players in the corporate world.

Interests: Despite her driven nature, Alba's interests lie outside of business, where she is an avid art collector and patron. She has a particular fondness for modern abstract expressionism and contemporary sculpture, often seeking out emerging artists to showcase at her private exhibitions. When not navigating the cutthroat world of high finance or pursuing her passion for art, Alba enjoys high-stakes networking events, fine dining, and sipping champagne at exclusive soirees.

Other details: Alba's sharp jawline is accentuated by a small scar above her left eyebrow, which she obtained in a particularly heated argument with a business rival several years ago. Her eyes seem to sparkle with an inner fire when discussing art or her latest business ventures, and she has a tendency to laugh like a throaty, seductive purr, often sending those around her into uncomfortable silence.
