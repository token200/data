Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Alba Ivanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alba is a brilliant and reclusive scientist with an obsessive nature. She has a tendency to isolate herself from others, fearing that her intense focus on her work will be disrupted by personal relationships. However, as she opens up to her sister Natalia, it becomes clear that she has been hiding from her insecurities and fears for too long. Alba is likely introverted and struggles with loneliness, but also possesses a deep-seated need for control.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 5'6" (168 cm) - Given Alba's Russian heritage, this height is plausible for someone of Eastern European descent.
* **Eye Color:** Dark Brown - This color complements her intelligent and intense personality.
* **Hair Color:** Jet Black - Similar to many Russians with dark hair, Alba likely has thick, straight black hair that falls down her back like a curtain.

**Interests:**

* **Science:** As mentioned in the story, Alba is a brilliant scientist who spends most of her time studying the mysteries of the universe. Her research focuses on wormholes and parallel universes.
* **Ancient Texts:** Alba's fascination with ancient texts suggests that she has an interest in history, mysticism, or esoteric knowledge. This might be connected to her scientific pursuits or a desire for spiritual growth.
* **Experiments and Research:** As a scientist, Alba is deeply invested in conducting experiments and research in her makeshift laboratory. Her hands-on approach and attention to detail are likely honed from years of practice.

**Additional Notes:**

Alba's upbringing as an only child with a estranged sister could have shaped her personality and behavior. Growing up without close family ties, she may feel more comfortable maintaining control over her personal life, much like how she controls the variables in her experiments.
