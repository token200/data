Based on the short story, here is a summary of Alba Jansone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alba is a quiet and introspective person who values her solitude. She is an outcast in her village, but this has not held her back from pursuing her passions. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often preferring to keep to herself rather than engage with the expectations of others. Despite this, she has a deep love for books and storytelling, which serves as a source of comfort and escape.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Alba's height is not specified in the story, but based on her being able to walk through snow-covered streets, it can be inferred that she is likely of average or slightly above-average height.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not explicitly stated, but given the description of her eyes as "always seeming to hold a secret," it's possible that they are an unusual shade such as green, blue, or grey.

**Interests:** Alba has a strong passion for books and storytelling. She works as a librarian, surrounded by shelves of stories waiting to be devoured. She is also drawn to the unknown, the unexplained, and the mysterious. This curiosity was encouraged in her childhood by her parents, who allowed her to explore the frozen lakes and forests surrounding her village.

**Additional Traits:** Alba appears to be perceptive and observant, as evidenced by Old Mat√≠as' comment that she can see right through others. She also has a deep appreciation for solitude and quiet contemplation, which is reflected in her love of reading and writing.
