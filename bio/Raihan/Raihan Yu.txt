Here is a summary of Raihan Yu's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Raihan Yu stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing green eyes that gleam with intensity. His sharp jawline and chiseled features are accentuated by his well-groomed dark hair.

**Personality:** Raihan is a complex individual driven by ruthless efficiency and unwavering ambition. He has built a reputation for getting what he wants, no matter the cost. However, beneath this polished facade lies a tangled web of insecurities and demons that have fueled his hunger for success since his early days in Shanghai.

**Interests:** Raihan is deeply invested in his work as the CEO of NovaTech, with an unwavering focus on growing his empire and dominating the markets. In his free time, he has an interest in art, often collecting and appreciating half-finished pieces that remind him of his early days in Shanghai.

It appears that Raihan's interests extend beyond business to more personal pursuits, such as fine scotch (specifically mentioned in the short story), which may hold sentimental value or serve as a coping mechanism for his inner demons. Despite his polished exterior, Raihan's fascination with art and past memories suggests a more introspective side to his personality.
