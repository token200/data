Here's a summary of Raihan Michielin's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Raihan is an enigmatic and introspective person who wears his emotions on his sleeve through his music. He has a deep sense of passion and creativity that drives him to express himself authentically. Despite his charming smile and piercing blue eyes, he can be quiet and reserved at times, preferring to observe the world around him before contributing to it. However, when his music is at its core, Raihan becomes fully alive, pouring out his heart and soul for all to hear.

**Physical Attributes:** Raihan stands at an average height of 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. His piercing blue eyes are almond-shaped, fringed by thick lashes that seem to hold a world of emotion within them. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face and chiseled cheekbones. He has a small tattoo of a violin on his left wrist, a token from the vintage instrument that set him on his path as a musician.

**Interests:** Raihan's primary interest is music – specifically, playing the violin with precision and passion. He is deeply rooted in the emotional expression of music and seeks to convey complex emotions through his melodies. When not making music, Raihan enjoys sketching, painting, and poetry – all creative outlets that allow him to tap into his inner world. Travel, history, philosophy, and literature are also interests he shares with his lover, adding depth to their conversations and shared adventures.
