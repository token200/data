**Physical Attributes:**
Raihan stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, almost purple, that seem to bore into those she encounters.

She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, which she obtained during her investigation into The Order.

Raihan is a complex and enigmatic individual with a razor-sharp mind and unwavering determination. Her polished facade hides a deep well of emotions and motivations that drive her to seek justice. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to uncover the truth. Despite this, she has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, which few people get to see.

**Interests:**
Raihan's interests are centered around solving mysteries and unraveling secrets. She is an avid collector of ancient artifacts and forbidden knowledge, often finding herself drawn into the world of occultism and esotericism. Her fascination with The Order and its mysterious goals drives her investigation, but she also has a deeper interest in understanding human psychology and behavior.

As she delves deeper into the mystery, Raihan's interests expand to include:

* Ancient mythology and symbolism
* Occult practices and rituals
* Paranormal phenomena and unexplained events
* Cryptography and codes
* Forensic science and analysis

Her complex web of secrets and motivations drives her to explore these interests, often taking her down dark and treacherous paths that challenge everything she thought she knew about herself and the world around her.
