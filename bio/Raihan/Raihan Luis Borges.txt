Here's a summary of Raihan Luis Borges' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Raihan stands at 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, reminiscent of a clear Argentine night sky, piercing and full of curiosity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Raihan is an intensely curious individual with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. His sharp intellect and quick wit often lead him to cut through conventional thinking, making him come across as confident and unorthodox. Despite his academic success, he struggles with feelings of restlessness, yearning to break free from the constraints of traditional thought. This drive for intellectual freedom makes him open-minded, adventurous, and willing to challenge established norms.

**Interests:**
Raihan's passions span a wide range of subjects, including literature (with a focus on Argentine writers), philosophy, physics, metaphysics, theology, mysticism, and spirituality. He is particularly drawn to the works of Jorge Luis Borges and other influential thinkers from his region. When he stumbled upon the eccentric old bookstore in La Boca, his fascination with alchemy, astrology, and ancient wisdom was reignited, further fueling his desire for a deeper understanding of existence.

As Raihan delves into these subjects, he finds himself torn between the comfort of abstract thought and the need to experience life firsthand. His journey takes him beyond the confines of academia, seeking answers in the vast expanse of human knowledge and understanding.
