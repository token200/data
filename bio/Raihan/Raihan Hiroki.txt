Here's a summary of Raihan Hiroki's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Raihan is a calculating and confident individual with a no-nonsense attitude. She exudes quiet strength and resolve, having learned to navigate the complex web of loyalty and deception in her world as a yakuza enforcer. Despite her tough exterior, she has a dry sense of humor, evident in the tiny crease between her eyebrows when she smiles to herself.

**Physical Attributes:** Raihan stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with chiseled features and raven-black hair that frames her sharp jawline. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. She has a lean, athletic build honed from years of martial arts training and high-stakes missions.

**Interests:** Raihan's interests are closely tied to her profession as a yakuza enforcer. She is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring down those who would exploit or harm others. Outside of work, she appears to have little interest in leisure activities, preferring to focus on her next mission or objective. Her only known contact outside of her organization is her handler Kaito, with whom she maintains a professional but personal relationship.

It's worth noting that Raihan's character seems to be more focused on her profession and goals rather than personal relationships or hobbies. She appears to be a self-reliant individual who relies on her own skills and instincts to get the job done.
