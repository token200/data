**Personality:** Johann Hébert is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, he appears charismatic and passionate, having been a rising star in Quebec's separatist movement as a young man. However, beneath this exterior lies a deeply troubled and resentful person, haunted by the tragic loss of his brother and consumed by anger and paranoia. Despite this, Johann is also shown to be introspective and vulnerable, as he opens up to Sophie about his past and struggles with feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

**Physical Attributes:** Johann Hébert is a 35-year-old French-Canadian man, suggesting that he may have a mix of physical characteristics from both his French and Canadian heritage. He stands at an unspecified height, but it can be inferred from the description of him standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon as having a more rugged or weathered appearance. His eye color is not explicitly stated, but it could be assumed to be brown or hazel given his French-Canadian background.

However, given his current state of emotional turmoil, his interests may also include more introspective pursuits such as literature, philosophy, or spiritual exploration. He may be drawn to contemplative activities like hiking, meditation, or simply spending time in nature, which is evident from his journey to the Grand Canyon.

Overall, Johann's personality and physical attributes suggest a man who is deeply wounded and seeking redemption, while his interests imply a desire for self-discovery, healing, and growth.
