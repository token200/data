Based on the inspiration from the short story, here's a summary of Johann Krūmiņš's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Johann is likely in his mid-to-late 50s, with an ageless quality that comes from years of traveling and living life to the fullest. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm), which may have been lost over the years due to a combination of wandering and artistic poses. His hair is silver-gray, often tousled and unkempt, framing his weathered face with wisps that suggest years of squinting against the sun. His eyes are an unsettling shade of piercing green, which seem to hold a depth and intensity that draws people in.

**Personality:**
Johann's demeanor may appear unassuming at first glance, but beneath this façade lies a complex individual with layers of emotion, creativity, and introspection. He is haunted by his own demons, yet remains open to the world around him, embracing its beauty and mystery. As a wandering artist, Johann embodies a sense of wanderlust, always on the move, yet deeply connected to the places he visits.

**Interests:**
At the core of Johann's existence lies his art. He is a painter, drawn to the cityscapes and architecture that inspire him. His passion for Riga's Baroque architecture, in particular, has had a lasting impact on his work, while Rome's vibrant culture and masterful artists have shaped his artistic style. Outside of painting, Johann is equally fascinated by people, their stories, and experiences, often capturing them through his art. He is drawn to the world of music, particularly classical compositions that evoke emotions and transport him to new realms.

**Additional Traits:**
- A nomadic lifestyle allows Johann to remain curious about different cultures and experiences.
- He has an uncanny ability to read people and understand their emotions.
- Despite his age, Johann retains a youthful spark, which is evident in his twinkle in the eye and infectious enthusiasm for art and life.
- Over time, he has developed an air of quiet confidence that stems from living life on his own terms.

Through these physical attributes, personality traits, and interests, Johann Krūmiņš emerges as a true Renaissance man - an individual who navigates the complexities of life with an artist's touch, fueled by curiosity and a passion for the world around him.
