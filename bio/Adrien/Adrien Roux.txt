**Personality:**
Adrien Roux is a cunning and agile individual with a sharp mind and quick reflexes. He has developed a tough exterior due to his experiences growing up in poverty, where trust was not an option.

- Height: Adrien stands at around 6'0" (183 cm), giving him an athletic build that allows for agility and quick movements.
- Eye Color: His eyes are described as piercing green, which may be a distinctive feature of his face.
- Appearance: He is slender with well-groomed features, dressing in tailored suits and accessorizing with diamond-studded cufflinks to make an impression on the high-society guests at events.

**Interests:**
Adrien's interests seem focused on his skills as a master thief. His expertise lies in deception and evading capture. He is intelligent, resourceful, and calculating, making him highly skilled at navigating complex situations like the money-laundering scheme he unraveled at the charity gala. The mysterious note from the green-eyed woman suggests he may have an interest or desire to use his skills for a greater purpose, potentially in collaboration with someone who shares similar goals.
