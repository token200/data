Here is a summary of Adrien Jansone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Adrien Jansone has a complex and multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears to be tough and rough around the edges, with a mysterious past that he keeps hidden from others. However, beneath this exterior lies a soft spot for those in need and a strong sense of justice. As he navigates his new life as a carpenter, Adrien is fiercely determined and resilient, but also humble and open to learning and growth.

**Physical Attributes:** Adrien stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up before making his move. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges appearance.

**Interests:** After leaving his life as a thief behind, Adrien discovers a new passion for carpentry under Colette's guidance. He finds joy in creating something with his own hands, from furniture-making to home repairs. Adrien is also drawn to the world of art, often spending hours sketching or painting in his free time. Music is another one of his interests, and he can often be found playing his guitar on quiet evenings at Colette's caf√©.

As Adrien continues down this new path, he finds solace in the knowledge that he has finally found someone who sees beyond his rough exterior to the person beneath. With Colette's guidance, Adrien slowly begins to rebuild his life, leaving his life as a thief behind him.
