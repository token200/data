Here's a summary of Adrien Dolera's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that seem to hold secrets
- Hair Color: Dark brown with subtle hints of auburn, often styled in a way that accentuates his sharp features
- Body Type: Lean and athletic build, honed from years of working as a photographer

**Personality:**
Adrien is a complex individual with a rich inner life. He has a deep sense of displacement due to his childhood experience in foster care, which makes it difficult for him to form lasting relationships or find his place in the world. Despite this, he's determined and driven, often throwing himself into his work as a photographer. Adrien is fiercely passionate about capturing the beauty in the world and telling stories that need to be told through his lens. He can come across as introverted or aloof at times, but once you get to know him, he reveals a dry sense of humor and a sharp wit.

**Interests:**
Adrien is deeply invested in photography and storytelling. His work often focuses on capturing moments of vulnerability and strength in equal measure. Outside of his profession, Adrien enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, seeking out new perspectives and experiences to fuel his creativity. He has a deep appreciation for art and music, often attending gallery openings and concerts when he can.

It's worth noting that Adrien's complicated past and current struggles with forming relationships have left him with a certain degree of emotional unavailability. This makes it challenging for him to fully open up to others, including Julian Saint Clair, who represents everything Adrien feels he isn't: confident, charismatic, and unapologetically himself.
