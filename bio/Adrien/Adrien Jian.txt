Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Adrien Jian's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Adrien Jian appears to be a highly intelligent and observant individual. His "trained instincts" and ability to pick up on subtle details suggest that he is a keen detective with a strong analytical mind. He also seems to possess a sense of quiet intensity and focus, which serves him well in his investigation.

Adrien's interactions with others, such as the owner of the nightclub and Akane, reveal a level of professionalism and respect. However, his instinctive curiosity about Akane suggests that he is driven by a desire to uncover the truth, possibly even at the expense of social niceties or conventions.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details on Adrien's physical appearance beyond mentioning that Akane has "piercing green eyes." However, based on his background as a detective from Paris, one might assume that he is likely to be:

* Male
* Middle-aged ( perhaps in his 40s or 50s)
* Tall and slender, with an air of elegance or sophistication

Given the context, it's possible that Adrien's height is around 6'0" (183 cm) to 6'2" (188 cm), with piercing brown eyes rather than green. This would be consistent with his reputation as a brilliant detective from Paris.

**Interests:** As a detective and an intelligent individual, Adrien's interests likely revolve around:

* Solving complex puzzles or crimes
* Analyzing evidence and piecing together seemingly unrelated facts
* Understanding human behavior and motivations
* Exploring different cultures and social dynamics

His interest in Akane, specifically, suggests that he is drawn to people who possess a certain level of mystery or potential for insight.
