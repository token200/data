Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Adrien Bernard:

**Personality:** Adrien is a introspective and emotionally guarded individual. He has a tough exterior that hides a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity. Despite being haunted by past traumas, he has learned to be strong-willed and independent, preferring to keep people at arm's length before opening up to those he trusts. However, as his relationship with Sophie progresses, it becomes clear that Adrien is capable of great kindness, empathy, and love.

**Physical Attributes:** Adrien appears to be in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. He stands approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which suggests a lean build, possibly developed from his time as a soldier. His eye color is an intense blue, almost icy in hue, which may reflect the emotional numbness he experienced during his military service. His hair is likely dark brown or black, which blends well with the surroundings of his cabin. Overall, Adrien exudes a quiet confidence and authority that commands respect.

**Interests:** As revealed through his relationship with Sophie, Adrien's interests include:

* Gardening: He finds solace in tending to his garden and watching life grow from seeds.
* Exploring nature: Adrien spends time exploring the woods surrounding his cabin, appreciating the beauty of the natural world.
* Storytelling: Sharing stories about his military service helps him process his emotions and come to terms with his past.
* Connecting with others: As he opens up to Sophie, it becomes clear that Adrien values meaningful relationships and is drawn to people who can see beyond his guarded exterior.

It's worth noting that Adrien's interests are closely tied to his emotional state. His experiences as a soldier have left him emotionally scarred, but through gardening, exploring nature, storytelling, and connecting with others, he finds ways to heal and move forward.
