Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Pawel Lehtonen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Pawel Lehtonen appears to be a passionate and intense individual with a strong sense of conviction. He has a raw energy and unbridled passion for his art, which drives him to share it with others, even if they may not fully understand or appreciate it. This suggests that he is also fiercely dedicated to his craft and perhaps a bit self-reliant. Despite his tough exterior, he seems vulnerable and open to connection with like-minded individuals.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no specific physical attributes mentioned in the story, so I will make some educated guesses based on the character's description:

* Height: Around 6'1" (185 cm) - tall enough to command attention without being imposing.
* Eye Color: Dark blue or grey, with an intensity that seems to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** It is clear that music is Pawel Lehtonen's primary passion and creative outlet. As a former street artist turned underground musician, he has channeled his energy into performing and sharing his art with others. He also appears to have an interest in connecting with others who share similar experiences and perspectives, as evidenced by his intense gaze at the young woman in the front row.

In addition to music, Pawel's interests may include:

* Social justice or activism - given his connection with those who feel like outsiders themselves
* Creative expression and self-discovery - as a former street artist turned musician
* Building meaningful connections with others - despite his tough exterior, he is drawn to people who understand him on a deep level.
