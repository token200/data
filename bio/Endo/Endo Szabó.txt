Here is a summary of the fictional character Endo Szabó:

Endo Szabó is a complex and introspective individual with a rough exterior that conceals a poet at heart. He stands at about 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an unassuming presence that often belies his inner world. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a world of emotions within them.

Physically, Endo has a wiry build, honed from years of writing and exploring the city streets on foot. His worn leather coat, which he wears with pride, is a testament to his love of the outdoors and his affinity for the rougher aspects of life. He often dresses in layers, favoring simple yet practical clothing that allows him to move freely.

Despite his rugged appearance, Endo has a kind face with sharp cheekbones and a mischievous glint in his eye. His dark hair is often tousled, as if he's just rolled out of bed, and his smile can light up a room when he chooses to reveal it.

In terms of hobbies, Endo enjoys walking, exploring new neighborhoods, and sipping coffee at his favorite café, Szabó's Tavern. He is also a bit of a night owl, often staying up late to write or simply to lose himself in the quiet of the evening.

Overall, Endo Szabó is a multifaceted individual with a rich inner life and a deep love for words, people, and the world around him.
