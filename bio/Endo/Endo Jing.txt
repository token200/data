Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Endo Jing:

**Personality:** Endo Jing is depicted as a fiercely independent and determined individual who refuses to be held back by societal expectations. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering resolve make her a formidable opponent, capable of withstanding even the most intense storms within herself.

Her strong sense of self-preservation and determination have led to her being banished from her clan, but this stigma only seems to fuel her drive to prove herself as a force to be reckoned with. Her emotions are likely intense and turbulent, often mirroring the stormy weather that rages inside her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Endo Jing's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will provide a reasonable assumption based on typical descriptions of female warriors.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified, but given her association with elemental forces and wind magic, it's possible that her eyes might be an piercing blue or stormy gray to match the turbulent weather she wields.

**Interests:** Based on her background as a Wind Dancer from the revered clan, Endo Jing seems to have a deep affinity for the element of air/wind. Her abilities and experiences make her passionate about mastering the tempests within herself, likely driven by a desire to understand and harness their power.

As a warrior trained in the desolate wastelands, she may also have an interest in survival skills, wilderness navigation, and battle tactics. Her connection to the mystical realm of Azura and its ancient power suggests that she might be drawn to exploring and understanding the deeper forces at play in her world.

Her experience as an outcast has likely led her to develop a strong sense of self-reliance and resilience, but also leaves room for personal growth and emotional exploration.
