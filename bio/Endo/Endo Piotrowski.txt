* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, suggesting a life of physical activity and agility.

**Interests:** While Endo is initially portrayed as a thief and con artist, there are hints of other interests beneath the surface. He seems to appreciate:

* Luxury and wealth (as evident from his desire to attend the masquerade ball hosted by Countess Helena)
