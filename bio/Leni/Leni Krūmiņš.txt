Based on the story about Lena Kruminskaya, I've created a new character profile for Leni Krūmiņš:

**Name:** Leni Krūmiņš

**Age:** 28

**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)

**Eye Color:** Deep blue with golden flecks, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea's unique water color.

**Personality:** Leni is a free-spirited and adventurous individual with a passion for photography. She's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of curiosity, which drives her to explore new places and capture their essence through her lens. Her creative energy is contagious, and she often finds herself at the center of lively discussions and impromptu jam sessions.

**Physical Attributes:** Leni has short, spiky hair that ranges from dark brown to a rich, chestnut color, depending on the season. Her bright blue eyes sparkle with mischief, and her petite frame belies a fierce determination and unwavering confidence.

**Interests:** Leni is an avid photographer and traveler, always seeking out new landscapes and subjects to capture through her lens. She's also a talented music enthusiast, playing the accordion and ukulele in local bands. When not exploring or creating art, she can be found sipping coffee at vintage cafes, browsing antique shops, or attempting to cook obscure recipes from around the world.

Inspired by Lena Kruminskaya's story, I've crafted Leni Krūmiņš as a kindred spirit – a creative and adventurous soul with a deep love for Latvia's natural beauty and culture.
