Lucía Zieliński is a woman in her mid-to-late twenties, standing at around 5'8" (172 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn long and straight down her back, while her eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, a nod to her profession as a journalist.

**Personality:**
Lucía is an ambitious and fearless individual with a quick wit and sharp mind. She is fiercely dedicated to her work and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. Her determination often leads her to neglect her personal life and relationships, which can make her come across as distant or preoccupied to those around her. Despite this, she has a strong sense of justice and compassion, driving her to pursue stories that need to be told.

**Interests:**
Lucía's interests are centered around investigative journalism and storytelling. She is passionate about uncovering hidden truths and shedding light on social injustices. Outside of work, she enjoys reading books on history, philosophy, and psychology, often finding inspiration in the works of thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Her love for music is equally strong; she plays the guitar and sings softly when alone, using songwriting as a creative outlet.

In her free time, Lucía can be found exploring old bookstores, attending underground art exhibitions, or participating in discussions on social justice at local coffee shops.
