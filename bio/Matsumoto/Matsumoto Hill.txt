* Height: The hill itself does not have a fixed height, but its spiritual energy is said to be present throughout Akakawa's rolling hills.
* Eye Color: There is no eye color mentioned for Matsumoto Hill, as it is more of an abstract entity.

**Personality:**
Matsumoto Hill has a wise and just personality, symbolizing guidance, protection, and the pursuit of wisdom. Its whispers to Kenji are gentle yet profound, offering words of encouragement and advice that help individuals navigate life's challenges. Matsumoto Hill seems to embody a deep understanding of human nature, allowing it to provide counsel that is both personal and universal.

**Interests:**
As an entity with spiritual energy, Matsumoto Hill's interests seem to revolve around the following:
