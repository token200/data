Here is a summary of Valdis Nowak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Valdis is a driven, perfectionistic individual who is passionate about baking. She is confident and determined, but also values the importance of friendship and support from those around her. As a self-proclaimed perfectionist, she can be quite hard on herself when things don't go as planned, but this drive ultimately fuels her creativity and success.

**Physical Attributes:** Valdis stands at 5'8" with bright blue eyes that sparkle with excitement whenever she's talking about baking. Her curly brown hair is often tied back in a neat ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. She has a fit and toned physique from years of working long hours in the bakery.

**Interests:** Valdis is, above all, passionate about baking and running her own bakery, "Sweet Treats." She spends most of her free time experimenting with new recipes, testing flavors, and perfecting techniques. She also enjoys spending time with her closest friends and family, particularly her best friend Sofia, who shares her love for baking. Other interests include food trends, decorating cakes, and traveling to explore new culinary traditions.

In terms of specific details, I added the following: Valdis's favorite flavor combination is lemon lavender, and she has a weakness for Italian gelato. She also enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to stay focused and centered in her busy life. Despite her driven personality, Valdis has a playful side that comes out when she's baking with friends or trying new recipes.
