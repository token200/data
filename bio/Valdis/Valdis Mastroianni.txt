Based on the short story, here is a summary of Valdis Mastroianni's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Valdis is a complex and multi-layered individual, with a rich inner life. As a former mob enforcer, he has been shaped by his experiences in the underworld, but as he begins to leave that life behind, he reveals a more vulnerable and sensitive side. He is haunted by the consequences of his past actions, but he also possesses a strong sense of resilience and determination. Valdis is driven by a desire for redemption and self-discovery, and he is willing to take risks to forge a new path in life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown, with hints of gray at the temples
* Body Type: Muscular, but lean and athletic, reflecting his years as a mob enforcer.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (a souvenir from one of his many violent confrontations).

**Interests:** In addition to art classes, Valdis develops an interest in music - particularly jazz and blues. He begins to see the parallels between creating beautiful music and crafting beautiful art, both of which require patience, dedication, and a deep understanding of human emotions.

As he navigates his new life, Valdis also becomes increasingly fascinated with the concept of identity and how it is shaped by our experiences. He starts to read philosophy texts on existentialism and the nature of selfhood, seeking to understand the meaning behind his own journey.

Through these creative outlets and intellectual pursuits, Valdis slowly begins to shed his old skin, revealing a more authentic and compassionate individual beneath.
