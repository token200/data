Here is a summary of the fictional character Valdis Jankowski:

**Physical Attributes:** Valdis stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. Her hair is a dark brown color that falls to her shoulders, often styled in a neat bob. Her eyes are piercing emerald green, a trait that has been noted by many as striking and unsettling. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, which she obtained during her time as an undercover agent.

**Personality:** Valdis is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a soft spot for those in need. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, having grown up on the streets of Warsaw during the war. Despite this, she has a deep empathy for others and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Her past experiences have made her wary of getting too close to people, but she is not entirely aloof; she values her relationships with those she trusts.

**Interests:** Valdis is an avid gardener and spends much of her time tending to her garden at her small cottage on the outskirts of Willow Creek. She finds solace in watching the birds and observing the natural world around her. In addition, she enjoys volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in community projects, which allows her to give back to the town that has taken her under its wing.

**Habits:** Valdis is an early riser and often spends her mornings watching the sun rise over the hills surrounding her cottage. She has a fondness for strong black coffee and tea, which she brews in a small kettle on her hearth. When she's working on a puzzle or playing strategy games with Sarah, she can become intensely focused, using all of her skills of observation to outmaneuver her opponents.

**Quirks:** Valdis has a habit of tapping her right foot nervously when she's anxious or thinking deeply about a problem. She also often finds herself humming softly to herself when she's working in the garden or lost in thought. Despite her tough exterior, she has a tendency to get sentimental over old photographs and mementos from her past.

Overall, Valdis Jankowski is a multifaceted individual with a rich history and complex personality. Her mysterious nature and sharp instincts make her both fascinating and intimidating to those around her, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there is more to this enigmatic woman than meets the eye.
