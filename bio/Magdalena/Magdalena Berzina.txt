**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing emerald green, with vertical pupils that seem to gleam in the dark.

**Personality:**
Magdalena Berzina is an enigmatic and reserved individual, preferring to keep to herself. She exudes an air of mystery and intrigue, making those around her feel both drawn to and wary at the same time. Her low, husky voice sends shivers down the spine, while her piercing emerald green eyes seem to bore into the souls of those she meets.

**Interests:**
Magdalena has a deep affinity for ancient texts, rare books, and arcane knowledge. She is particularly drawn to the occult, mysticism, and forbidden arts, which fuels her insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of the universe. Her love for learning and discovery drives her to collect and study rare volumes on these subjects, filling her isolated abode with a vast library of ancient tomes and dusty relics.

Magdalena's interest in secrecy and mystery may stem from her reclusive lifestyle, which allows her to observe human nature without being observed herself. Her desire to keep secrets hidden is driven by a mix of protectionism, curiosity, and a sense of responsibility towards those who might not be prepared for the truth.

As she shares her story with Sophia, Magdalena's words reveal a depth of emotion, passion, and vulnerability that belies her enigmatic exterior.
