**Personality:** Magdalena is a introspective and compassionate individual who has a strong sense of duty and loyalty towards her family. She is also determined and resilient, as evident from her decision to return to Kyzylorda despite the challenges she may face. Her experiences abroad have made her more worldly and open-minded, but she still values her roots and heritage.

**Physical Attributes:** Magdalena has a slender build, standing at 5'8" (173 cm) with a calm and serene demeanor. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in loose waves, and her eyes are a deep shade of blue that seems to hold a hint of sadness. Her features are delicate yet strong, reflecting her inner resilience.

She has a deep love for the natural world and is drawn to the vast steppes of Kazakhstan, where she can find solace in the quiet rhythms of rural life.
