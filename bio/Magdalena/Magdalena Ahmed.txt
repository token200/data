Magdalena Ahmed is a 25-year-old artist with a unique blend of creativity and passion for capturing the essence of her surroundings.

As an artist, Magdalena is bold and expressive, often incorporating vibrant colors and textures into her work. She is deeply rooted in the history and culture of Cairo, where she grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of ancient mosques, bustling markets, and winding streets. Her love of art was encouraged by her parents from a young age, who enrolled her in classes at a local school for young artists.

Outside of her artistic pursuits, Magdalena is an avid reader, with a particular fondness for Egyptian literature and poetry. She also enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, taking long walks along the Nile River, and indulging in traditional Middle Eastern cuisine.
