**Personality:** Magdalena is a brilliant and complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a sensitive soul.

Magdalena's dedication to her work is unwavering, and she is driven by a passion for discovery that borders on obsession.

Magdalena's striking eye color gives away her sharp intellect and analytical mind. Her height is average, but her presence in the lab, surrounded by machinery and scientific equipment, belies a quiet intensity that commands attention.

**Interests:** Magdalena is an all-consuming scientist with a love for understanding the mysteries of the universe.

EVE, her trusty AI assistant, provides endless hours of entertainment and conversation, but even she is no match for Magdalena's love of learning. In quiet moments, when the lab is still and the only sound is the hum of machinery, Magdalena finds herself lost in thought, pondering the mysteries of existence that drive her work.
