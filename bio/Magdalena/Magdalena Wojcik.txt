Here's a short summary of Magdalena Wojcik's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Magdalena stands at 5'8" (172 cm) tall with long, curly brown hair that often falls down her back. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with curiosity, and she has a small nose ring that hints at her artistic side. She has a quiet confidence about her, which belies her reserved nature.

**Personality:** Magdalena is an introverted person who feels most alive when surrounded by art and music. Despite her bookish demeanor as a librarian, she has a wild creative streak that she's been afraid to unleash on the world until she met Max. She's passionate, intuitive, and fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Interests:** Magdalena is an avid reader of poetry and literature, with a special fondness for jazz, blues, and avant-garde music. Her love for art knows no bounds, and she spends her free time sketching, painting, or playing the guitar. When not tending to her day job at the library, you can find her exploring local festivals, concerts, and underground music venues.

As a person of few words, Magdalena lets her actions speak louder than her words. She's always been drawn to people who share her passion for life's beauty â€“ Max Wells being the most significant exception to this rule.
