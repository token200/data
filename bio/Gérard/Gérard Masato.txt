In addition to art, Gérard is also deeply interested in philosophy, literature, and psychology. He's an avid reader and enjoys delving into the works of great thinkers and writers. His introspective nature makes him naturally inclined towards self-discovery and personal growth.

Gérard's love for travel and exploration is another significant aspect of his life. Despite his reclusive tendencies, he has a deep appreciation for the world around him and enjoys wandering the streets of Paris, observing life, and soaking up new experiences.
