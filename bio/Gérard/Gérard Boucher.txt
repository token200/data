**Personality:**
Gérard is a quiet, introspective person who wears his passion for art and history like a badge of honor. He is driven by a sense of curiosity and discovery, always seeking to uncover new insights and perspectives on the art world. Despite his many achievements, he remains humble and unassuming, preferring to let his work speak for itself.

Gérard's love for art and history is all-consuming. In addition to his extensive knowledge of French art from the 19th century, he has a particular fascination with the lives and works of lesser-known artists. He is also an avid traveler and collector, always on the lookout for new and exciting discoveries to share with his wife Sophie.

Outside of work, Gérard enjoys reading (particularly art history texts), attending concerts and exhibitions, and exploring the city's hidden corners in search of inspiration. He is a true Renaissance man, with a boundless enthusiasm for life and a deep appreciation for beauty in all its forms.
