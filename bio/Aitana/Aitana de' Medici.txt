Here's a summary of Aitana de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Aitana stands at about 5'6" (168 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her golden hair is one of her most distinctive features, often worn in an intricate braid beneath her elegant veils. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with inner light, especially when she's lost in thought. She has a small nose and delicate features that reflect the refined beauty of the Medici family.

**Personality:** Aitana is a complex and multifaceted individual, driven by her passion for music. She's introspective and creative, often feeling like an outsider within her own noble household. Her love for music sets her apart from her peers, who are more concerned with their social status and marrying well. Despite this, Aitana remains true to herself, and her relationship with Luca has given her a sense of freedom she never knew before. She's also fiercely curious and open-minded, often seeking answers to life's mysteries through the lens of music.

**Interests:** Music is Aitana's true passion, and she spends every spare moment practicing, composing, or listening to songs on her lute. She's drawn to the emotional depth and expressiveness of music, which allows her to convey feelings she struggles to verbalize. In addition to her love for music, Aitana also enjoys strolling through Florence's cobblestone streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, and pondering the mysteries of life and art.

**Other traits:** As a member of the powerful Medici dynasty, Aitana is well-versed in politics and etiquette, which can sometimes make her feel trapped or stifled. However, she's not one to be swayed by social conventions for long; her love for music and creative expression always draws her back to what truly sets her soul on fire. Despite the whispers and admiring glances that follow her, Aitana remains humble and grounded, preferring to focus on the beauty of art rather than the attention it brings.
