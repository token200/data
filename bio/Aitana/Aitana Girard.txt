**Personality:** Aitana is a vibrant and imaginative individual, with a deep connection to her Catalan heritage and a passion for storytelling through art. Her personality is infectious, drawing people in with her warmth and enthusiasm. She is fiercely creative and dedicated to her craft, but also knows how to balance her artistic pursuits with the demands of everyday life.

**Interests:** Aitana's interests are diverse and multifaceted. By day, she loves learning about art history, particularly the works of Spanish surrealist artists like Dalí and Miró. She is also passionate about traditional Catalan music and dance, often incorporating elements of these into her performances as La Luna Negra.

As a performer, Aitana draws inspiration from mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, using these stories to weave enchanting narratives through her puppet shows and shadow plays.
