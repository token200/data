Here's a summary of Aitana Jankowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aitana is a complex and introspective individual with a sharp wit and infectious smile. Despite her outgoing personality, she has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic to those who don't know her well. However, beneath her confident exterior lies a deep sense of self-doubt and insecurity, which she has developed as a result of growing up in a small town where everyone knew each other's business.

**Physical Attributes:** Aitana is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a bright, piercing green that seem to sparkle with mischief when she's talking about something she's passionate about. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** Aitana is a creative and organized person who loves planning events and making people happy. In her free time, she enjoys trying out new recipes in the kitchen, practicing yoga, and reading classic literature. She's also a bit of a thrill-seeker and loves to travel to new places, experience different cultures, and try new activities.

Aitana is also an avid music lover and plays the guitar, often writing her own songs as a way to process her emotions and reflect on her experiences. She finds solace in nature and spends many hours walking in the woods or sitting by a lake, watching the sunset.
