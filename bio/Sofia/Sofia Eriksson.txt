Here is a summary of Sofia Eriksson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sofia is a 25-year-old woman with an average height of 5'8" (173 cm). Her hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy, piecey look. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to hold a depth of emotion. She has a small tattoo of a camera on her left wrist, which she got on one of her many adventures.

**Personality:** Sofia is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, she appears to be tough, resilient, and independent, having grown up in a troubled home and learned to rely on herself from a young age. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a sensitive and vulnerable person who has been deeply affected by her past traumas. Sofia is fiercely introverted and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her, but once you gain her trust, she reveals a deep well of emotions and empathy.

**Interests:** As a freelance photographer, Sofia's primary interest is in capturing the gritty reality of urban landscapes through her lens. She is drawn to the darker side of life, often exploring abandoned buildings, crime-ridden neighborhoods, and other forgotten spaces that reveal the beauty and complexity of the human experience. However, as she begins to open up to Max and others, Sofia starts to explore new interests in art therapy, social justice, and building community, realizing that her photography can be more than just a way to cope with trauma - it can be a powerful tool for healing and connection.

Overall, Sofia is a deeply nuanced and multi-faceted character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are shaped by her experiences and passions.
