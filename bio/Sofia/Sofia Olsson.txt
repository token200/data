Here's a summary of Sofia Olsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Sofia is a creative and empathetic individual who is not afraid to express her emotions. She has a strong desire for authenticity and meaning in her life, which has led her to feel unfulfilled in her corporate event planning job. Despite this, she is determined and open to new experiences, as seen when she steps out of her comfort zone to visit the quirky bookstore.

**Physical Attributes:** Sofia is likely a petite young woman with a slender build. Her height is around 5'2" (157 cm), which would have allowed her to stand out in a crowd despite wearing a bright yellow sundress. Her eye color is likely blue or green, given the description of her feeling an "inexplicable pull" towards the bookstore and later finding a collection of poetry that speaks directly to her soul.

**Interests:** Sofia appears to be a creative person with a love for literature and poetry. She feels a strong connection to the written word and is drawn to the Moonlit Pages bookstore, which becomes a sanctuary for her during her visit. Her interest in poetry suggests that she values self-expression, emotional depth, and meaningful connections.

In addition to her literary interests, Sofia's profession as an event planner indicates that she is organized, detail-oriented, and enjoys working with people. However, her restlessness and desire for something more creative suggest that she may be looking for a deeper purpose in life beyond her corporate job.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide many details about Sofia's background or personal history, so some of these attributes are speculative based on the provided context.
