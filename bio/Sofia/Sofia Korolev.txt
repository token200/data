Here is a summary of Sofia Korolev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of hazel
- Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle golden glow from her Russian heritage
- Hair: Long, curly brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back

**Personality:**
Sofia is a deeply passionate and determined individual. She has an innate need to express herself authentically through dance, and she will stop at nothing to bring authenticity to her performances. Despite her natural talent, Sofia struggles with self-doubt and feeling like an outsider in the strict ballet world. However, once she finds her footing, she becomes a confident and expressive artist who pours her heart into every performance.

**Interests:**
- Dance (obviously!), particularly classical ballet and contemporary forms
- Music - Sofia has a deep love for Tchaikovsky's scores, which often evoke the emotions she experiences during performances
- Theatre - She finds storytelling and character development in dance to be an incredibly powerful tool
- Poetry - Sofia is a voracious reader of poetry, finding solace in the emotional depth it offers
- Philosophy - She's particularly drawn to existentialist thought, which speaks to her own struggles with identity and purpose.

**Quirks:**
Sofia has a habit of humming or singing softly to herself when she's feeling anxious or overwhelmed. In rare moments of calm, she likes to sit cross-legged on the floor with a notebook and write poetry or journal entries about her experiences as a dancer.

I added a few details such as hair color and skin tone based on common Russian heritage characteristics, as well as hobbies like reading and philosophy that are not mentioned in the original text but might fit with Sofia's personality.
