On the surface, he appears confident and successful as an architect, but beneath this façade lies a deep-seated sense of emptiness and disconnection. He is searching for meaning and purpose in his life, often feeling like something is missing despite his outward success. However, when confronted with new experiences and perspectives, such as the spiritual retreat in rural Japan, Santiago shows a resilience and openness that allows him to grow and transform.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Age: 32
* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm brown eyes, reminiscent of his abuela's gaze
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly for professional settings but able to express himself with a bit of messy texture when not formal

**Interests:** Santiago has a passion for architecture and design, which drives much of his success as an architect. However, he also develops a strong interest in spiritual growth and self-discovery through the retreat in rural Japan. He is drawn to practices like meditation and yoga, which help him connect with his inner self and find meaning beyond material possessions or social status.

As Santiago navigates his life journey, it becomes clear that these various aspects of himself – from his professional successes to his introspective explorations – are interconnected threads forming a rich tapestry of personal growth and transformation.
