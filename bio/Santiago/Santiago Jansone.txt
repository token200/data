Here is a summary of Santiago Jansone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Santiago is a complex and introspective individual driven by purpose and determination. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having spent his life at sea where he was forced to rely on himself. After the loss of his wife, he was consumed by grief and disorientation, but eventually found solace in the sea once again. Santiago is also deeply curious and open-minded, willing to listen to stories and learn from others. He is a bit of an outsider and non-believer in traditional tales of supernatural forces, preferring instead to interpret events through his own practical experience.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with a warm golden ring around the iris
* Hair: Graying brown, worn long and wild like the sea itself
* Build: Lean and weathered from years at sea, with a wiry strength that still holds up well to manual labor.

**Interests:** Santiago has a deep love for the sea and its rhythms. He spends his days learning new skills, listening to the ocean's secrets, and seeking guidance from his mentor. His interests include:

* Reading signs of the sea: understanding tides, wave patterns, and animal behavior
* Listening to the whispers of the ocean: sensing changes in the weather and underwater currents
* Fishing and boating: enjoying the thrill of reeling in a catch or navigating through treacherous waters.
* Storytelling: Santiago is drawn to the old fisherman's wife's tales of sea monsters and hidden treasures, which spark his imagination and sense of wonder.

As he navigates life on land, Santiago becomes increasingly interested in the mysteries of the human condition. He seeks guidance from others, sharing his own experiences and insights, and helping those around him navigate their own paths in life.
