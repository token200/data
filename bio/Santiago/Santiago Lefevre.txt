**Personality:**
Santiago is a introspective and creative person who has struggled to find direction in life after his art career stalled. He is haunted by past regrets and uncertainties about the future. However, he is also fiercely determined and passionate about his craft, with a deep love for capturing the beauty of the world around him.

**Interests:**

It's worth noting that Santiago is still grappling with his identity and sense of purpose after a failed art career. He has been away from the art world for five years, trying to make sense of his past. As he reconnects with Emma and begins to paint again, we see him rediscover his creative spark and start to find new meaning in life.

His background as an artist suggests that he is drawn to exploring themes of light, color, and texture in his work. He likely has a deep appreciation for the natural world and finds inspiration in its rhythms and patterns. His love of music suggests that he may also be introspective and contemplative, often lost in thought while working on his art.
