Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Santiago Oja:

**Personality:** Santiago is an introspective and enigmatic individual. His experiences have made him guarded and emotionally reserved, but beneath his stoic exterior lies a deep well of passion, creativity, and a strong sense of conviction. He is haunted by the loss of his lover Sofia and struggles to find meaning in a world that no longer resonates with him. However, as he embarks on his journey through the desert, he begins to discover a newfound sense of purpose and understanding.

**Physical Attributes:** Santiago stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall, with an athletic yet gaunt build that reflects his years of hiking through the harsh desert landscapes.

His journey is one of self-discovery and exploration, as he navigates the vast expanses of Baja California's wilderness in search of meaning and solitude.
