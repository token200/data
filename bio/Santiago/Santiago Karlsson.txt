Here's a summary of Santiago Karlsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Santiago is a restless and adventurous individual with a strong desire for excitement and possibility. He has a charming smile and rugged good looks that have made him a favorite among women, but he also has a complex and troubled past. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for the sea and a deep longing for connection and belonging.

**Physical Attributes:** Santiago stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing blue eyes and dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt. He has a strong jawline and a scattering of light stubble on his chin, which adds to his rugged charm.

**Interests:** Santiago is deeply passionate about the sea and has always been drawn to its power and mystery. As a former soldier, he's had extensive experience with sailing and fishing, and these skills have served him well in his travels. He's also an avid fisherman and enjoys trying new species of seafood. In addition to his love of adventure, Santiago is fascinated by languages, history, and culture, which has led him to become fluent in several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish.

Santiago's interests outside of the sea include music (he plays the guitar), reading (he's particularly fond of classic literature and philosophy), and exploring new places. He's always on the lookout for the next great adventure and is willing to take risks to experience new things.

**Additional Traits:** Santiago has a habit of leaving his life in a hurry, which often makes it difficult for him to form lasting connections with people. However, he's also fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Despite his many accomplishments and experiences, Santiago still feels a sense of restlessness and uncertainty, as if there's always something just out of reach that he needs to find.
