Here is a summary of Santiago Hideki's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Santiago Hideki is a master thief and smuggler with a practiced air of detachment. He has a calculated and analytical approach to his work, often relying on his instincts and skills to get by. Despite this, he has a hint of excitement and anticipation when it comes to new marks, suggesting that there's more to him than just a cold-blooded thief. However, he also shows vulnerability when it comes to his interactions with Mei, revealing a sense of curiosity and intrigue.

**Physical Attributes:** Santiago Hideki stands at 6'2" (188 cm), which is on the taller side for an Asian male. His eye color is a piercing brown that seems to bore into those around him. His hair is unkempt and dark, often falling across his forehead in messy locks. He has a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of physical activity and stealth.

**Interests:** Santiago Hideki's primary interest is in becoming the best thief and smuggler on the underground circuit. He spends most of his time planning and executing complex heists, always looking for ways to improve his skills and evade authorities. However, with Mei's proposition, a new spark of curiosity has been ignited within him, suggesting that he may also be interested in exploring the personal side of his craft - perhaps even forming alliances or partnerships.
