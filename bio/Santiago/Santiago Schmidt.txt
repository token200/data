Here's a summary of Santiago Schmidt's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Santiago is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He has learned to rely on himself due to his foster care experience, which has made him resourceful and determined. However, this same upbringing has also left emotional scars, making him prone to self-doubt and introspection. As he navigates the music industry, Santiago struggles with feelings of disconnection and loss of identity, but ultimately finds solace in sharing his gift with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Santiago stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build, reflecting his upbringing on the wrong side of the tracks. His eyes are a deep brown, rich with the emotional depth he has gained through his experiences. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges persona.

**Interests:** Santiago's primary interest is music, which serves as both an escape and a source of fulfillment for him. He is passionate about playing the guitar and teaching himself new chords and melodies. As he evolves as an artist, his interests expand to include jazz and improvisation, as seen in the small jazz club where he discovers his true purpose.

In addition to music, Santiago's experiences have also shaped his interest in exploring his childhood memories through creative outlets like storytelling or visual art (not mentioned in the original story). This connection to his past serves as a way for him to process his emotions and connect with others on a deeper level.
