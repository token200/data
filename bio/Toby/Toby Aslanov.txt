Here is a summary of Toby Aslanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Toby Aslanov stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall, with an athletic build that suggests a disciplined lifestyle. His dark hair is often messy, adding to his introspective and troubled demeanor. His piercing blue eyes are deep-set and seem to bore into those he looks at, as if searching for hidden truths.

**Personality:** Toby Aslanov is a deeply curious individual consumed by the desire to unravel the mysteries of the world. He is intensely focused on his pursuits, often becoming completely absorbed in his work, neglecting other aspects of his life. This obsession can lead to frustration and tension with those around him, as seen in his interactions with Sophia.

Despite his intensity, Aslanov has a soft spot for those he cares about, particularly Sophia, whom he has known since childhood. He is fiercely loyal and protective of his friends, even if it means sacrificing his own well-being or compromising his values.

Aslanov's sharp intellect and analytical mind make him an excellent researcher, but they also contribute to his obsessive tendencies. His introspective nature and tendency to get lost in thought can lead him down rabbit holes of speculation and conjecture, which can be both a strength and a weakness.

**Interests:** Toby Aslanov is an avid reader and collector of rare books on various subjects, including history, philosophy, and science. He spends hours pouring over dusty tomes and manuscripts, searching for clues and insights that might help him understand the world better. His love of learning drives his quest for knowledge and fuels his curiosity.

Aslanov is also a skilled researcher and analyst, able to piece together seemingly unrelated facts and events to form theories and hypotheses. He is particularly drawn to mysteries and unsolved enigmas, which often occupy his thoughts and inspire his research endeavors.

However, Aslanov's all-consuming pursuit of knowledge can lead him to neglect other aspects of his life, such as relationships and personal well-being. His focus on the past can also distract him from the present, making it challenging for him to connect with others or find balance in his life.
