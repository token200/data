Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Toby Jones, I'll create a summary based on the inspiration provided about the musician Toby Jones.

Here's a fictional character profile:

**Physical Attributes:**
Toby Jones is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with creativity, and his hair is a dark brown color that often falls across his forehead in a messy, endearing way.

**Personality:** Toby is a free-spirited individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's passionate about music and has a natural talent for storytelling through his lyrics. His creative spirit is infectious, and he has a way of connecting with people from all walks of life. Despite his artistic nature, Toby is down-to-earth and humble, often finding humor in the most mundane situations.

**Interests:** As an artist, Toby's interests lie at the intersection of music, poetry, and art. He's always been fascinated by the human condition and enjoys exploring themes of love, loss, and self-discovery in his songwriting. In his free time, he loves to experiment with new instruments, learn about different cultures, and travel to inspire his creativity.
