Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Toby DiCaprio:

**Personality:** Toby DiCaprio is a driven and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. As a private investigator, he has honed his skills to solve even the most baffling cases, and he is fiercely independent. He has a sharp mind and is not afraid to think outside the box. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to help those who cannot help themselves.

**Physical Attributes:** Toby DiCaprio stands at 6'2" with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of staying active while working on cases that often require him to navigate challenging environments. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his strong facial features. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for any hidden motives. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly grueling investigation.

**Interests:** Toby DiCaprio is passionate about art and history, often finding himself fascinated by the stories behind the masterpieces that have been stolen. When not working on cases, he enjoys attending gallery openings and museums, where he can learn more about his craft and appreciate the beauty of art. He is also an avid reader of true crime novels and non-fiction books on investigative techniques.

**Hobbies:** In his rare moments of downtime, Toby DiCaprio enjoys playing guitar, particularly jazz standards, which help him relax and clear his mind. He is also a skilled chess player, often using the game to think through complex cases and develop strategies.

It's worth noting that I made some changes to the character profile based on the short story, as some details were not explicitly stated (e.g., Toby's eye color).
