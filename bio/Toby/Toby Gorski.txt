However, beneath his tough exterior lies a complex and introspective individual who is still searching for purpose and meaning in life.

**Physical Attributes:** Toby Gorski stands at 6'1" with an athletic build, which likely comes from years of physical activity during his childhood on the rough streets of New York City.
