Here's a summary of Toby Dumas' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Toby stands at around 5'9" with a lean build, often seen as a ruggedized version of his slender physique. His dark brown eyes are fringed with thick eyelashes that add to their allure. A scattering of light stubble on his jawline gives him an air of youthful vitality, while his jet-black hair is always slightly unkempt.

**Personality:** Toby Dumas has a charismatic and quick-witted personality, which he uses to deflect from his inner turmoil. He's sharp-tongued and sharp-eyed, able to defuse tense situations with ease. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a complex and troubled soul. He struggles with feelings of loneliness, inadequacy, and anger, stemming from the loss of his mother at a young age. His past experiences have taught him to rely only on himself, making it difficult for him to form close relationships or ask for help.

**Interests:** Toby has a deep passion for music, particularly jazz and blues. He's an accomplished trumpet player, but music is often overshadowed by his love of writing and storytelling. He dreams of one day writing a novel that would make him famous, which he believes could be a means to validate himself and leave a lasting legacy. His other interests include literature, poetry, and reading, which provide him with solace and inspiration.

Additionally, Toby has a strong interest in history, particularly the rich cultural heritage of New Orleans, where he grew up. He draws inspiration from his mother's stories about LeRoux Dumas' adventures on the streets of NOLA and often incorporates elements of this narrative into his own writing.

Toby's interests are diverse, reflecting his eclectic personality, but they all seem to be tied together by a shared desire for creative expression and validation.
