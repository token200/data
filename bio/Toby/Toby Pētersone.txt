Here's a summary of Toby PÄ“tersone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Toby is a quiet, unassuming individual who blends into the background, but behind his reserved exterior lies a creative genius with a passion for mimicry and performance art. He is highly skilled at quick wit and improvisation, which enables him to think on his feet and navigate complex situations with ease.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair: Unkempt brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a way that makes him look perpetually disheveled.
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a slender physique that allows him to move effortlessly between different personas.

**Interests:** Toby is an avid collector of costume pieces, makeup, and props. He has a particular fondness for obscure historical periods and mythological creatures, which he draws inspiration from when creating his performances. When not honing his craft or working on new projects, Toby enjoys attending underground art gatherings and avant-garde performances in Riga's subculture.

Toby is also an avid reader of philosophy and psychology texts, particularly those that explore the nature of identity and perception. He finds solace in books that challenge conventional wisdom and encourage him to question his own sense of self.

As a skilled impersonator, Toby has developed a keen ear for accents, dialects, and mannerisms from various cultures and eras. This eclectic knowledge allows him to immerse himself fully in different personas, making it increasingly difficult for those around him (and himself) to distinguish reality from fiction.
