Based on the short story, here's a summary of Léon Roberts' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Léon Roberts is described as a man who "remained true to himself and his art," suggesting that he values authenticity and staying committed to his passion for photography. He appears to be a creative and curious individual, always looking to explore new techniques and styles.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - This is not explicitly stated in the original story, but it seems fitting given Léon's artistic and adventurous nature.
* Eye Color: Blue - The short story doesn't provide any details about Léon's eye color, so I've assumed a blue hue that complements his French heritage and artistic personality.

**Interests:** Photography is, of course, Léon's primary interest. He has a passion for capturing the beauty of nature, culture, and humanity through his lens. Additionally, he seems to appreciate other forms of photography, such as street and landscape photography, which he discovers during his visit to New York City. His interests also extend to people and their stories, as evident in his new project focused on portraits that capture the essence of individuals from all walks of life.
