**Personality:** Léon is a quiet and introspective person with an air of intensity. He has developed a habit of observing his surroundings, always watching and waiting for something to happen. Over the years, this has led to him becoming withdrawn and solitary. However, when he meets Sophie, he begins to open up and reveal a complex web of emotions beneath his armor.

**Physical Attributes:** Léon is a man in his mid-40s with unruly grey hair, which suggests a life of solitude and possibly some personal struggles. His eyes are described as "like two deep wells," indicating that they may hold a profound intensity or depth. There is no mention of his height, but it can be inferred from the fact that he sits comfortably in the café without appearing overly large.

**Interests:** Léon's interests appear to include literature and poetry, as he engages in conversation with Sophie about these topics. He also seems to have an appreciation for art, particularly street art, which is a part of Sophie's project. Additionally, his connection with Sophie sparks a newfound interest in exploring the city's seedy underbelly, suggesting that Léon may be curious about the world around him.

It's worth noting that Léon's personality and interests have been shaped by his solitary life, which has led to a sense of detachment from others. However, his encounter with Sophie sets off a chain of events that awakens something within him, hinting at a deeper potential for connection and purpose.
