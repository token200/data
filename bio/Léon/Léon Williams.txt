**Physical Attributes:**

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide explicit details about Léon's childhood or background, but based on his age (likely in his mid-to-late 40s) and experience as a former detective turned private investigator, it's possible that he has a rich history of law enforcement service before turning to private investigation.
