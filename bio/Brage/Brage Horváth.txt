Here is a summary of the fictional character Brage Horváth's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:**
Brage Horváth is a man of mystery and intrigue, with an insatiable curiosity that drives him to uncover the truth. He has a keen mind and sharp instincts, which serve him well in his work as a private investigator. Despite his sharp intellect, he remains unreadable behind his wire-rimmed glasses, giving little away about his thoughts or emotions.

**Physical Attributes:**
Brage Horváth is likely a tall and slender man, possibly around 6'1" (185 cm) to 6'2" (188 cm), with an athletic build that suggests he remains physically fit. His eye color is brown, which complements his dark hair and rugged features.

**Interests:**
As a private investigator, Brage's primary interest is solving mysteries and uncovering the truth, no matter how complex or sinister the case may be. He has an insatiable curiosity that drives him to dig deeper and follow leads wherever they may lead. Outside of work, it can be assumed that Brage enjoys spending time alone, perhaps indulging in his love of reading, drinking coffee, or taking long walks through Vienna's streets.

It is also worth noting that Brage seems to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by his use of the formal title "Fräulein Anna" when addressing his client. This suggests that he may have a somewhat aloof demeanor, which serves him well in his line of work but may also make it difficult for others to get close to him.

One additional detail that can be inferred from the story is Brage's possible background and motivations. The fact that he left Hungary as a young man and has never looked back suggests that he may have fled a tumultuous past or was trying to escape something. This mystery surrounding his personal life adds an air of intrigue to his character, making him even more compelling as a private investigator.
