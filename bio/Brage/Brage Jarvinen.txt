**Personality:** Brage is an enigmatic figure known for his sharp wit and quick reflexes on the battlefield. He has a tough exterior, but beneath it lies a compassionate and empathetic individual who is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. His experience as an outcast has left emotional scars, but he uses his empathy to connect with others, particularly children like Lily.

**Physical Attributes:** Brage stands at 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He has short, dark brown hair that is often unkempt, giving him a rugged and battle-hardened appearance. His athletic build and lean physique are a testament to his years of combat training.

**Interests:** Beyond being a skilled mercenary, Brage's interests lie in protecting the vulnerable and making a positive impact on the lives of those around him. He has a particular fondness for helping children who have been abandoned or mistreated, and he is driven by a desire to create lasting change in his community. When not on a mission, Brage enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's hunting or simply taking in the beauty of nature.
