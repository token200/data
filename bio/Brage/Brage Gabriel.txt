**Physical Attributes:** Brage stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is a dark brown color, often worn in a messy, textured style that frames his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, a deep blue that seems to hold a world of emotions within them.

**Personality:** Brage is a complex and enigmatic individual, shrouded in mystery. On the surface, he appears reserved and introverted, preferring to let his music speak for him rather than engaging in conversation. However, beneath this exterior lies a deeply creative and empathetic soul. He is fiercely passionate about his art, and his love for music, poetry, and self-expression knows no bounds.

**Interests:** Brage's passions are diverse and far-reaching. He is an avid fan of traditional folk music, poetry, and jazz, often drawing inspiration from these genres to inform his own unique sound. He is also deeply interested in philosophy, psychology, and existentialism, which he believes inform the deeper themes and emotions that run through his lyrics.

**Hobbies:** In addition to playing music and writing, Brage enjoys long walks in nature, reading classic literature, and practicing yoga. He is a self-proclaimed coffee aficionado and can often be found sipping on a cup of expertly brewed coffee while lost in thought.

**Values:** For Brage, creativity, authenticity, and connection are the most important values he holds dear. He believes that art has the power to transcend boundaries and touch hearts in ways that nothing else can. As a result, he strives to create music that is honest, vulnerable, and true to his own unique voice.
