Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Brage Jankowski:

**Physical Attributes:** Brage Jankowski stands at approximately 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build, honed from his years as a soldier. His eyes are an unsettling shade of gray-blue, often seeming to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. His dark hair is cropped short, framing his sharp features and angular jawline.

**Personality:** Brage's personality is characterized by his mysterious nature, with a dry sense of humor that only reveals itself to those close to him. He is calculating and analytical, always assessing the situation and weighing his options before making a move. His years as a hitman have taught him to be fiercely independent and self-reliant, with a strong sense of loyalty only to those he trusts. Despite this tough exterior, hints of vulnerability and emotion linger beneath the surface, suggesting a deeper complexity to his character.

**Interests:** As a former soldier turned hitman, Brage's interests lie in the darker corners of life. He is drawn to the thrill of the hunt, the rush of adrenaline that comes with navigating the underworld of Warsaw. Outside of work, he seems to have little interest in leisure activities or hobbies, preferring instead to keep to himself and observe the world around him from a safe distance.

However, it's worth noting that Brage's interests may be slightly more nuanced than initially meets the eye. As someone who has been played by Vasiliev, he may have developed a fascination with uncovering secrets and navigating complex webs of deceit. This could suggest that Brage is drawn to puzzles or mysteries that require him to use his skills as a hitman to unravel them.

Additionally, given his troubled past and experience with corruption at the highest levels, Brage's interests may also include an interest in politics, economics, or social justice - areas where he can use his skills to make a difference from within.
