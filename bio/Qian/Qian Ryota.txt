Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Qian Ryota's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ryota is a highly resourceful and analytical individual with a dry sense of humor. He has experience working in high-pressure situations as an assassin, which has taught him to remain calm under stress. However, his past experiences have left emotional scars, and he now struggles with trust issues and feeling like an outsider. Despite this, he's fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Physical Attributes:** Ryota is a tall individual, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm). His eye color is an piercing shade of indigo, which seems almost unnatural in his pale complexion. He has short, dark hair that's often styled in a practical manner, and he sports a lean, athletic build honed from years of martial arts training.

**Interests:** Ryota is an avid fan of old literature, particularly ancient Chinese poetry, which helps him find solace in the stillness between cases. As a security consultant, he has a deep fascination with surveillance technology and counter-surveillance techniques. His interest in understanding human psychology also drives his ability to read people and anticipate potential threats.

Ryota's interests are balanced by his darker past, where he was often consumed by the thrill of the hunt and the adrenaline rush that came with it. However, as he's grown older and begun to rebuild his life, he's found a new sense of purpose in using his skills for good.
