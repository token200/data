**Personality:** Qian Kentaro appears to be an enigmatic and mysterious individual with a calculating demeanor. He is seemingly detached from the world around him, able to blend into shadows unnoticed. His piercing green eyes suggest a sharp intellect and keen observational skills. Despite his intimidating presence, he has a wry sense of humor, as evident in his subtle smile when using his sedative.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Approximately 5'9" (175 cm) - tall enough to be imposing without being overly conspicuous.

As an elusive figure with unparalleled abilities, it is likely that he also has interests in the darker corners of society, such as organized crime or underworld activities. His involvement with the local businessman and his ability to extract valuable information from him suggest a fascination with power and control.

**Additional Details:** Given his nickname "Kento" among those closest to him, it's possible that Qian Kentaro has a softer side, one that is not immediately apparent in public.
