It's worth noting that I made some adjustments to fit the fictional character into a more cohesive and well-rounded profile. I omitted details like her parents' names and background as Cuban immigrants, as they weren't directly relevant to her personality, interests, or physical attributes. However, her Cuban heritage is still implicit in her upbringing and worldview.
