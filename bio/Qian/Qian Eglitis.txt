**Other Details:** Qian Eglitis has a fascination with ancient cultures and mysticism, often incorporating esoteric knowledge into their research. They are fluent in multiple languages, including ancient tongues such as Sanskrit and Egyptian hieroglyphics, which aid them in deciphering forgotten texts and understanding celestial phenomena. Despite their reputation as a "dimension-hopper," Qian Eglitis is surprisingly humble and unassuming, preferring to keep a low profile and focus on their research rather than seeking fame or recognition.
