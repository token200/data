Since there is no information available on a character named Qian Järvinen, I will create a fictional character inspired by the story about Ava Järvinen.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Name: Eira Järvinen
* Age: Late 20s
* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green

**Personality:**

Eira is a determined and resourceful individual with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her. However, once you earn her trust, she is fiercely loyal and will stop at nothing to protect her loved ones and uncover the truth.

**Interests:**

Eira has a passion for puzzle-solving and cryptanalysis, which served her well in her career as an amateur sleuth. She enjoys reading classic detective novels and studying psychology, particularly the fields of hypnosis and persuasion. In her free time, she loves to explore abandoned buildings and practice martial arts to stay physically fit.

**Background:**

Eira grew up in a small town on the outskirts of a larger city, where she developed a keen eye for detail and observation skills that served her well in her investigation career. She has a troubled past, having lost a loved one under mysterious circumstances when she was younger, which fueled her determination to uncover the truth and make sense of the world around her.

Please note that these details are entirely fictional and were created on the fly to fill out the character profile.
