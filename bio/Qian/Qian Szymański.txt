Since there is no existing information on the character Qian Szymański, I will create a fictional profile for them.

**Physical Attributes:**
Qian Szymański is a 25-year-old Polish-Lithuanian woman. She stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) with an athletic build. Her hair is a dark brown color, often worn in a messy bob that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a striking feature - a deep shade of emerald green, which seem to sparkle with warmth and intelligence.

**Personality:**
Qian is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who is always eager to take on new challenges. She has a passion for photography and storytelling, often using her camera to capture the beauty in everyday moments. Qian's curiosity and love for learning make her an excellent researcher and problem solver. However, she can also be fiercely independent and non-conformist at times, which may lead to friction with authority figures.

**Interests:**
Qian has a deep interest in history, folklore, and mythology from various cultures, particularly those of Eastern European descent. She is an avid fan of punk rock music and attends underground concerts whenever she can. Qian also enjoys practicing yoga, meditation, and other mindfulness techniques to maintain her mental balance.

**Background ( fictional ):**
Qian Szymański hails from a small town in Lithuania, where she grew up surrounded by rich cultural heritage and history. Her parents, both anthropologists, encouraged her curiosity about the world and nurtured her passion for storytelling and photography. After completing her studies in anthropology and journalism, Qian set out on her own journey, documenting her experiences and adventures through her camera lens.
