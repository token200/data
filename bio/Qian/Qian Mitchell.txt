Qian is deeply connected to the natural world and finds solace in its rhythms and patterns. She spends much of her free time exploring the woods surrounding Willow Creek, tracking wildlife, and tending to the needs of visitors.

As a park ranger, Qian's interests align with her work, as she patrols the forest, identifying areas for conservation and education. Her passion for fencing has also led her to explore other martial arts disciplines, such as tai chi and qigong, which complement her love of nature and self-discovery.
