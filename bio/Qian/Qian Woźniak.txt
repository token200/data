Based on the inspiration from the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Qian Woźniak:

**Physical Attributes:**
Qian Woźniak is a 28-year-old woman of Chinese descent. She stands at about 5'6" (168 cm) with a slender yet athletic build, often attributed to her busy lifestyle as a journalist. Her dark brown hair is usually styled in a neat bob, and her bright hazel eyes sparkle with intensity when discussing investigative journalism. Her features are delicate, but her facial structure conveys a sense of determination.

**Personality:**

Her sharp mind and quick thinking make her a formidable journalist, always on the lookout for potential leads and sources. Qian's natural curiosity and empathy for others drive her to dig deeper into stories, often putting her in precarious situations. Despite facing opposition and threats, she remains resolute and undaunted, relying on her wit, intelligence, and quick thinking to navigate challenging situations.

**Interests:**
Qian Woźniak is an avid reader of history, philosophy, and psychology, which fuel her investigative curiosity and inform her approach to journalism. She's also a passionate fan of Chinese literature, often finding inspiration in the works of writers like Lu Xun and Meng Jiangnu. In her free time, Qian enjoys practicing tai chi, which helps her maintain balance and clarity in an increasingly chaotic world.

**Other Details:**
Qian Woźniak's family background is modest, with her parents working hard to provide for their younger siblings. Her experience of growing up in a lower-income household has instilled in her a strong sense of social responsibility and empathy for those struggling to make ends meet. She holds a degree in journalism from Fudan University, where she developed a passion for storytelling and investigative reporting.

Qian's personality, physical attributes, and interests all come together to define the character of Qian Woźniak: a fearless, determined, and compassionate journalist driven by a pursuit of truth and justice.
