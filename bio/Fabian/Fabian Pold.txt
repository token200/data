His low and husky voice suggests a depth and complexity to his personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Fabian Pold is described as having piercing green eyes. No height or hair color are specified in the original text, so I will provide some additional information based on typical artistic stereotypes:

- Height: 6 feet (1.83 m) - This height would place him above average but still fitting for an artist who spends most of his time indoors.
- Eye Color: Piercing Green Eyes
- Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, shoulder-length hair that's often tousled and unkempt, adding to his enigmatic persona.

**Interests:** Fabian Pold is described as a reclusive artist with an exceptional talent for painting.
