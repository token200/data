His past experiences have instilled in him a sense of detached pragmatism, making it difficult for him to form close relationships or reveal his true emotions. However, beneath his stoic exterior lies a dry wit and a deep sense of loyalty to those he trusts. Fabian is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else.

**Interests:** When not on active duty, Fabian enjoys classical music, particularly the works of Mozart and Chopin.
