Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Stefan Piotrowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Stefan is a complex and introspective individual who has been heavily influenced by his traumatic past. He is quiet, observant, and often feels like an outsider due to his experiences as a child. As an adult, he struggles with feelings of emptiness and disconnection from the world around him. Despite this, he possesses a deep desire for wisdom and understanding, which drives him to seek out new paths in life.

Physical Attributes:
Stefan appears to be a slender individual, but no specific height or weight is mentioned. However, it can be inferred that he has a gaunt appearance due to his prolonged exposure to cold weather and emotional turmoil. His eyes are described as being fixed on the ground, suggesting that they may appear distant or introspective.

Interests:
Stefan's interests lie in mathematics and physics, which served as a means of escape for him during his childhood. However, after experiencing personal loss and trauma, he began to feel disconnected from these fields. The inscription "La sagesse est une autre chose que le savoir" ("Wisdom is another thing than knowledge") seems to spark a newfound interest in Stefan, leading him to explore the realm of wisdom beyond his own intellectual pursuits.

It's also possible that Stefan has an appreciation for literature and old books, given the scent of old books and worn leather that he catches while walking through the park. This discovery appears to be a catalyst for his transformation and sets him on a path towards rediscovering himself.
