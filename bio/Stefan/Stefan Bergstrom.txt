Based on the short story, here is a summary of Stefan Bergstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Stefan Bergstrom appears to be intensely focused and driven by his work as a cryptologist. He is determined and persistent in the face of complexity and frustration, as evident from his ability to stay concentrated for hours on end without wavering. His singular obsession with unraveling the mystery behind the puzzles suggests that he is fiercely intelligent and detail-oriented.

However, Stefan also seems to have an introspective side, as hinted at by his reaction when he discovers that the puzzle message is about his own past. This emotional vulnerability suggests that he may be more than just a brilliant cryptologist, but also someone with personal demons or secrets.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the description of the woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, Stefan's physical attributes are less specified in the story. However, let's fill in some gaps:

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - a relatively tall and lean build for someone who appears to be intensely focused and driven.
* Eye Color: Blue-green or gray-blue eyes with a sharp, intelligent glint - perhaps with a hint of blue undertones that complement his pale complexion.
* Hair: Dark brown or light blond hair that's neatly combed, possibly with a subtle fringe (or bangs) that frames his face.

**Interests:** As a renowned cryptologist, Stefan's primary interest is cryptography itself. He has spent years studying the art of cryptography and appears to be deeply passionate about deciphering codes and uncovering hidden messages.

However, beyond his professional interests, it seems that Stefan is also curious about his own past and the secrets that lie within the puzzle message. This suggests that he may have a strong interest in self-discovery, personal history, and potentially even psychology or sociology.

Additionally, as someone who has spent years solving complex puzzles, Stefan might also enjoy activities that challenge his mind and provide a sense of intellectual satisfaction, such as reading cryptography texts, participating in academic debates, or engaging in other problem-solving hobbies.
