Stefan stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with a rugged yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a hint of warmth and kindness. He has a strong jawline, accentuated by a scattering of stubble, which adds to his rough-around-the-edges charm.

**Personality:**
Stefan is a complex individual with a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. On the surface, he appears reserved and self-effacing, often deflecting attention away from himself. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deeply compassionate and empathetic person who has earned the trust and respect of his community through his tireless efforts to help others. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect and support them.

**Interests:**
Stefan's interests are deeply rooted in his connection to his community. As a carpenter, he takes pride in creating beautiful and functional pieces of furniture that reflect the town's history and character. He is also passionate about helping out at his friends' businesses, whether it's fixing broken appliances or offering advice on everything from business strategy to relationships. In his free time, Stefan enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking through the nearby woods or simply sitting in his garden, watching the sunset.

Stefan is also a bit of a romantic, with a deep appreciation for literature and poetry. He spends hours reading classic novels and scribbling verse in his notebook during his breaks at work. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for music, particularly folk ballads that evoke the nostalgia of his childhood.
