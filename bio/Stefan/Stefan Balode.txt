**Personality:** Stefan Balode is a seasoned and introspective detective with a strong sense of determination. He has seen it all in his years as a Latvian police officer and is not easily rattled by the complexities of a case. However, he also has a dry sense of humor and an air of quiet confidence that allows him to remain calm under pressure. Despite his tough exterior, Stefan has a deep respect for art and its ability to convey hidden meanings.

**Physical Attributes:** Stefan Balode stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often neatly combed back, revealing piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he interviews. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly rough case when he was younger.

**Interests:** Stefan is an avid art lover and collector, with a particular fondness for the works of local Latvian artists. When not solving crimes, he enjoys strolling through Riga's narrow streets and admiring the Gothic architecture that dominates the cityscape. He is also a fan of traditional Latvian folk music and cuisine, often seeking out local taverns to sample their specialties.

In terms of his interests outside of work, Stefan values simplicity and authenticity. He has a modest apartment near the city center, where he enjoys cooking simple meals and practicing yoga in his spare time. Despite his many responsibilities as a detective, Stefan also makes it a point to visit local art galleries and museums whenever possible, always on the lookout for new inspiration or clues that might aid him in his investigations.
