Here is a summary of Stefan Kowalski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Stefan is an intensely driven and focused individual, often to the point of obsession. His dedication to his work is admirable, but also leaves him isolated from others, causing them to be wary of getting close to him. He appears to have a strong sense of responsibility, as he is willing to push forward with his research despite feeling watched and even threatened. Despite this, there is an undercurrent of vulnerability, as Stefan becomes increasingly consumed by the darkness that surrounds New Orleans.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair: Black and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him appear slightly disheveled.
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a hint of gauntness due to his intense focus on work.

**Interests:** Stefan's interests are centered around uncovering the secrets of ancient texts and artifacts. He is particularly fascinated by the history of New Orleans and its dark past. His research takes him deep into the city's mythology and folklore, often blurring the lines between fact and fiction. As he delves deeper into his work, Stefan becomes increasingly drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, often feeling an otherworldly connection to the city itself.

In addition to these interests, Stefan has a deep fascination with the occult and the supernatural, which is reflected in his obsession with deciphering the cryptic words on the ancient scroll. He appears to be drawn to the darker aspects of human nature, which makes him both vulnerable to the malevolent energy that surrounds New Orleans and uniquely attuned to its secrets.

Overall, Stefan Kowalski is a complex character driven by his passion for discovery, but also haunted by the darkness that he uncovers in his research.
