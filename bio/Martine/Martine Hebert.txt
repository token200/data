Here is a summary of Martine Hebert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Martine Hebert stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her bright hazel eyes are a deep shade of brown with a sharp, intelligent glint, which seems to bore into those she interviews. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Martine is a fiercely determined and passionate individual who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. Her strong sense of justice and commitment to fairness drive her to dig deep into the most complex stories, often putting herself in harm's way. She has a quick wit and sharp mind, which serves her well when interviewing sources and analyzing evidence. Despite her tough exterior, Martine has a compassionate side and genuinely cares about the people she meets, which motivates her to bring attention to their struggles.

**Interests:**
Martine is an avid reader of history books and has a particular fascination with local folklore and mythology. She loves visiting archives and libraries, where she can immerse herself in dusty tomes and forgotten records. When not working on a story, Martine enjoys taking long walks through the woods surrounding Saint-Pierre, observing the people and places that inhabit the town. She is also an avid musician and plays the guitar in her spare time, often using music as a way to relax and clear her mind.

It's worth noting that while I made up most of these details, some traits from Martine's personality and behavior were already evident in the original story (e.g., her determination, strong sense of justice).
