**Physical Attributes:** Martine stands at about 5'8" (173 cm) with long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a rich cascade.

Her skin is sun-kissed and weathered from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Interests:** Martine has always been drawn to the ocean, finding solace and inspiration in its vastness and power.
