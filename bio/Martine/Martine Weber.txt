Her height is around 5'8" (173 cm), allowing her to move easily between her studio and the surrounding city. Her hair is probably long and unruly, often tied back in a loose ponytail as she works, and her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo that seems to sparkle with creativity. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, hinting at her mixed ancestry.

**Personality:** Martine is an introspective and imaginative individual with a passion for the unknown and the surreal. She is fiercely creative and intensely focused on her art, often to the point of neglecting other aspects of her life. Despite this dedication, she has a compassionate side and is drawn to those who are also artists or appreciate the beauty of art. Martine's connection to her inner world and the world around her makes her acutely aware of the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality.

**Interests:** As an artist, Martine's interests revolve around exploring the realms of dreams, mythology, and human condition through painting. She is particularly drawn to the works of surrealist artists like Dalí and Miró, and she sees her own art as a form of channeling the subconscious mind. Her great-grandmother's sketchbook has become an inspiration for Martine, who feels a deep sense of connection to her artistic heritage.
