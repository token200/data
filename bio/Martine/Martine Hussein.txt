Since I don't have any information about a fictional character named Martine Hussein, I'll create a character profile based on my imagination. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Martine Hussein is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with a slender yet athletic build. She has long, curly dark brown hair and piercing green eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending time outdoors.

**Personality:**
Martine is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who is always up for trying new things. She is fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. Martine is highly intelligent and resourceful, often relying on her quick wit and cunning to get out of sticky situations.

**Interests:**
Martine is an avid traveler and loves exploring new cultures and landscapes. She is particularly fascinated by history, mythology, and folklore from around the world. In her free time, she enjoys practicing martial arts, playing the guitar, and writing short stories. Martine is also a passionate environmentalist and spends much of her time advocating for sustainable living practices and conservation efforts.

Please note that this character profile is entirely fictional and not based on any real person. If you have any further requests or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!
