However, beneath her tough exterior lies a complex and vulnerable person who cares deeply about her work and those around her.

She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, which is slightly above average height for a French woman.

**Interests:** Martine Durand's primary interest is cooking and running her restaurant, Le Coeur de la Vie. She has a lifelong passion for French cuisine and is particularly known for her exquisite sauces and dishes. Outside of the kitchen, it appears that Martine values family above all else, as evidenced by her close relationship with her niece Sophie.

**Additional Details:** Although not explicitly stated in the original text, one might assume that Martine Durand has a strong sense of loyalty and dedication to those she cares about. Her outbursts in the kitchen can be a sign of her deep frustration when things don't go according to plan, but they also reveal a commitment to excellence and attention to detail. Additionally, Martine's introduction of Laurent as an apprentice may suggest that she is willing to mentor and teach others, even if it means putting aside her temper for a moment.
