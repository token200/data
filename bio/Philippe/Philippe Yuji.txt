Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Philippe Yuji's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Philippe Yuji appears to be a charismatic and confident individual with a keen sense of adaptability. He can effortlessly switch between two personas - his mild-mannered chef persona and his skilled art thief persona. His ability to remain calm under pressure suggests that he is also quite composed and calculated, which would be essential for carrying out high-stakes missions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Philippe appears to be tall, with no specific mention of a height range in the story. However, considering his imposing presence as an art thief, it's likely that he stands around 6'2" or taller.
* Eye Color: Initially described as having bright blue eyes, but later transformed into piercing brown eyes, which suggests that he may have some degree of ability to alter his eye color or appearance through some means (though this is not explicitly stated in the story).
* Hair Color: His hair starts as raven-black and then changes to a wild tangle of grey. This drastic change in hairstyle could indicate that he has an affinity for disguise and altering his appearance to blend in.
* Jawline and Facial Features: Philippe's jawline is initially described as chiseled, which suggests that he may have a strong, angular face structure.

**Interests:** As revealed through the story, Philippe Yuji seems to be deeply interested in art, particularly rare and valuable pieces. He appears to have an extensive knowledge of art history and can identify unique works. His passion for art drives his desire to infiltrate high-stakes auctions and collect these masterpieces for himself.

In addition, Philippe's interests might also extend beyond art itself, given his experience as a skilled chef. It's possible that he enjoys the world of food culture or has an interest in human nature and behavior (which could be reflected in his ability to understand and manipulate people).

It is worth noting that these are just inferred details based on limited information from the provided short story, and there might be additional layers to Philippe Yuji's personality and interests.
