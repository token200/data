His calmness is unnerving, as if he's always thinking several steps ahead of the game.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and perfectly in place
* Facial Features: Chiseled, angular features with high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Philippe Kalnins is an expert at poker and enjoys the thrill of the game. He's also drawn to high-stakes situations, where he can put his skills to the test. His interest in human behavior and psychology allows him to blend in seamlessly with others, making him a master of manipulation. In his free time, Philippe might enjoy sipping fine cocktails or attending exclusive social events, always on the lookout for opportunities to gather intel or make connections that could further his career.

His work as a spy and operative has taught him to be detached and focused, prioritizing his goals above all else. While he may have won over some of the players at the high-stakes poker game with his poker face, it's unlikely he'll get too close to anyone, even if they seem friendly or inviting. His work comes first, and that will always stay in the shadows.
