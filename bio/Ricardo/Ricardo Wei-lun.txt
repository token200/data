Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ricardo Wei-lun's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Ricardo Wei-lun is a perceptive and astute individual with an uncanny ability to sense people's emotions. He is cautious in complex social situations due to his empathetic nature. Despite this, he is also confident and determined, evident in his pursuit of justice. Ricardo shows compassion and understanding, as seen when he decides to let Elara Vex off with a warning.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown

There are no other physical attributes mentioned in the short story, so I will not provide any additional information on that topic.

**Interests:**

As a lead detective at the Shanghai Police Department, Ricardo Wei-lun's primary interest is in solving crimes and uncovering the truth. He is driven by his passion for justice and is dedicated to serving his community. On a personal level, it appears that he values understanding human emotions and behavior, as evident in his ability to sense people's feelings and navigate complex social situations.

It's worth noting that Ricardo's interests may extend beyond his work as a detective, given his introspective nature and desire for self-improvement (as hinted at by the lesson he learned from Elara Vex). However, this is not explicitly stated in the short story.
