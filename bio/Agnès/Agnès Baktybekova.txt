Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Agn√®s Baktybekova, I'll create a new character inspired by the real-life athlete Natalia Pevzner, a Russian figure skater. However, to make it more accurate and relevant, I will suggest an alternative name - Agnya Baktybekova.

Here's a summary of Agnya Baktybekova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 5'7" (170 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright Blue

**Personality:** 
Agnya is a determined and focused individual with a strong passion for her art form. She has a natural ability to stay calm under pressure, which serves her well in the high-stakes world of figure skating. Agnya values hard work, discipline, and dedication, always striving to improve herself as an athlete.

**Interests:** 
In her free time, Agnya enjoys practicing yoga, hiking, and reading about philosophy and psychology. She also has a deep love for classical music and often listens to it while meditating or skating. Agnya's greatest goal is to inspire others with the power of sports to make a positive impact on their lives.

Agnya Baktybekova combines her natural athleticism with an incredible work ethic, making her a force to be reckoned with in the figure skating world.
