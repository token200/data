Agnès is a resilient and resourceful young woman, forged from the fires of adversity. Despite her family's fall from power, she has adapted remarkably well to life as a nomad, learning to rely on herself and the desert environment for survival. Her determination to preserve her heritage and reclaim her ancestors' legacy drives her forward, even in the face of uncertainty.

**Interests:**

Agnès is drawn to knowledge, history, and the stories of her people. She has a keen interest in astronomy and the movements of the stars, which often serve as a guiding force for navigation. Her fascination with the natural world and the ways of the desert tribes also makes her an adept observer of plants, animals, and weather patterns.

As she travels with Marcus, Agnès becomes increasingly interested in history, learning about the Roman Empire's rise and fall from her mentor. She is particularly drawn to the accounts of ancient Rome's military campaigns and the lives of its people, finding inspiration in the triumphs and struggles of those who came before her.

**Additional Details:**

Agnès' name carries significant cultural weight for her. As a child, she struggled with her family's legacy, feeling ashamed of their decline. However, with Marcus' words echoing in her mind - "You have the spirit of an Aurelius within you" - Agnès begins to see her heritage as a source of strength and resilience rather than weakness.

Her connection to Marcus also ignites a spark of curiosity about the world beyond the desert. As she travels with him, Agnès becomes increasingly aware of the vastness of human knowledge and experience, feeling an insatiable hunger for understanding and learning.

Ultimately, Agnès emerges as a brave and determined young woman, driven by her love of family, heritage, and the thrill of discovery.
