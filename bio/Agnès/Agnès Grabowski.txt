Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Agnès Grabowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Agnès seems to be a introspective and emotional person. She has a fragile Polish soul that was once supported by her partner, suggesting she may have been vulnerable in the past. However, over time, she has developed coping mechanisms and found comfort in routine. Her ability to recall fond memories with ease suggests a strong capacity for nostalgia and perhaps even melancholy.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: Agnès is likely of average height, given that her partner's size isn't explicitly mentioned.
- Eye Color: Since there is no mention of eye color, I will make an assumption based on the setting of the story. Given that it takes place in Paris, a city known for its romanticism and aesthetic appreciation, Agnès might have eyes that are typical of Eastern European or Slavic features.

**Interests:** As suggested by her profession as a writer, Agnès likely values creativity, self-expression, and the written word. She also seems to appreciate literature, poetry, and possibly philosophy given the discussions with her partner about these subjects.
