**Physical Attributes:** Agnès stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build. Her eyes are an piercing green, a trait that seems almost otherworldly in the dim light of the steppes. Her hair is dark brown, often tied back in a practical ponytail when she's on the move. She has a scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose, which darken when she spends more time outdoors.

**Interests:** Agnès is passionate about archaeology and the study of ancient civilizations.
