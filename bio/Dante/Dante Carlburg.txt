Here's a summary of the fictional character Dante Carlburg:

**Physical Attributes:** Dante is a tall and lean man, standing at 6'2" with a strong build that hints at his former mercenary lifestyle. His hair is dark brown and flecked with grey, while his eyes are a piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Dante exudes an air of quiet confidence and introspection. Despite his rugged exterior, there's a deep sense of loyalty and justice that drives him to protect those in need. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, having built walls around himself over the years to shield himself from the traumas of his past. However, when provoked or passionate about a cause, his eyes flash with a spark of intensity, revealing the complexity beneath his stoic exterior.

**Interests:** As an avid woodworker, Dante finds solace in creating beautiful and functional pieces that showcase his craftsmanship. He's particularly skilled in traditional Italian woodworking techniques, which allows him to channel his creativity into something peaceful and meditative. When not working on a project, he enjoys spending time outdoors, watching the sun set over the Adriatic Sea or simply taking long walks through the rolling hills of rural Italy.

While Dante appears content with his quiet life, the reappearance of Alessandro and the tantalizing prospect of a new adventure awaken a fire within him that refuses to be extinguished.
