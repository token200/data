Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dante Palmas:

**Personality:** Dante Palmas is known for his razor-sharp wit and unapologetic attitude, which can make him both lovable and infuriating to those who know him. He has a sarcastic sense of humor and isn't afraid to speak his mind. Despite his sharp tongue, he is also shown to be empathetic and genuinely interested in connecting with others, particularly when it comes to shared passions like literature.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue

These physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, but based on Dante's confident demeanor and charismatic presence, these traits seem fitting.

**Interests:** As a freelance writer and part-time professor, Dante Palmas has a deep appreciation for literature, particularly modernist works like T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land". He is also shown to be interested in discussing the world's most heinous literary works, suggesting that he values complexity and nuance in his reading material.

Additionally, Dante seems to have a passion for connecting with others who share his interests and values, particularly through conversation and shared experiences.
