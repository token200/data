**Personality:** Dante Ławniczak is a determined and resourceful individual with a strong sense of justice. Having experienced personal tragedy at a young age, he has developed a keen analytical mind and a willingness to take risks in pursuit of the truth. His troubled past has also made him fiercely independent and self-reliant.

**Physical Attributes:** Dante stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build, suggesting a background in sports or physical activity. His hair is dark brown, typically kept neatly styled, and his eyes are a deep, expressive brown that misses the piercing green of The Architect's gaze. He has a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, hinting at a potentially rough past.

**Interests:** Dante's interests revolve around investigation, detection, and problem-solving.

Additionally, he enjoys reading classic literature, particularly works by authors like Kafka and Dostoevsky, which reflect his introspective nature.

It's worth noting that Dante's background as a Polish immigrant adds an extra layer of depth to his character, with potential ties to the country's cultural and historical context influencing his worldview and motivations.
