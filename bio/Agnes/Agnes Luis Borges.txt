Based on the short story provided as inspiration, I have created a fictional character profile for Agnes Luis Borges:

**Name:** Agnes Luis Borges
**Age:** Late 50s/Early 60s (exact age unknown)
**Physical Attributes:**

**Personality:** Agnes is an introverted and enigmatic figure who prefers the company of books to people.

Despite her reclusive nature, Agnes exudes an aura of intelligence and creativity, inspiring those around her to tap into their own imagination.

**Interests:** Agnes is passionate about ancient mythology, folklore, and the mysteries of the universe. She spends most of her days pouring over dusty tomes, scribbling in her notebook, and conjuring up characters and plot twists that seem to come alive on the page. Her interests also include gardening, astronomy, and philosophy.

**Additional Details:**
- Agnes has a small tattoo of a celestial map on her left shoulder blade, which she obtained during a solo journey through South America.
- She is an avid collector of rare books, manuscripts, and ancient artifacts, which fill the shelves of her cluttered study.
