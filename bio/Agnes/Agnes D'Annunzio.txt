Agnes stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a sturdy yet elegant build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a neat bun when she's working. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with warmth and kindness, giving away her gentle nature. She has a small tattoo of a pastry bag on her left wrist, a token from her Italian heritage.
