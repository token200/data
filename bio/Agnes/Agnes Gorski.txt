Based on the short story about Agnes Gorski, here is a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Agnes has a sharp wit and quick tongue, which suggests that she is confident, outspoken, and not afraid to stand up for herself or those she cares about. However, beneath her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for strays - both human and animal alike. This duality of traits indicates that Agnes is compassionate, empathetic, and willing to take on challenges.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide much information about Agnes' physical appearance beyond mentioning that she is not specified by her height or eye color in the provided text.

However, based on the context and tone of the story, I can make some educated guesses:

* **Height:** Based on the narrative style and the author's description, it's likely that Agnes is a woman in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. This suggests that she has reached a point where she has established herself as an adult and is confident in her abilities.
* **Eye Color:** The eye color of Agnes is not mentioned in the story, but based on the description of her tough exterior and compassionate nature, I imagine her to have piercing eyes - possibly brown or hazel.

**Interests:**

* Animal welfare: As the owner of a local animal shelter, Agnes has a deep passion for caring for stray animals. She spends countless hours playing with dogs like Max, taking them on walks, and teaching them tricks.
* Community engagement: Agnes is actively involved in her community, whether it's visiting the farmers market or taking Max on adventures around town. This suggests that she values building relationships and contributing to the well-being of those around her.
* Self-care: With a busy schedule of caring for animals and navigating potential criticism from others, it's likely that Agnes prioritizes self-care - sipping sweet tea on her porch is mentioned as a way for her to relax.

Overall, Agnes appears to be a kind-hearted, determined individual with a strong sense of purpose.
