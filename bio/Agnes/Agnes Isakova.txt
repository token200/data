Based on the short story provided, here's a summary of Agnes Isakova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Agnes is a complex and introspective individual with a mix of emotions. She is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand her brother's motivations, which hints at her analytical nature. Her feelings of surprise, anger, and eventually connection suggest that she is also empathetic and open-minded. As the night progresses, Agnes reveals herself to be a listener and someone who can engage with others on a deep level.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the provided story doesn't explicitly describe Agnes's physical attributes in detail. However, considering her ability to recognize Viktor from across the room, it can be inferred that she is observant and has good eyesight. Given her appreciation for jazz music and the dimly lit atmosphere of the club, Agnes might have a more understated or classic sense of style.

**Height:** While there's no direct indication of her height, it's possible that Agnes stands around 5'6" to 5'8", as this would allow her to notice Viktor from across the room without being overly tall or imposing.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, Agnes's eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story. However, given the contrast with Viktor's piercing blue eyes, it's likely that Agnes has brown or hazel-colored eyes.

**Interests:** As indicated by her presence at a jazz club and appreciation for Ella Fitzgerald's music, Agnes seems to enjoy live music, particularly jazz and classic American standards. Her interest in understanding her brother's motivations suggests that she values personal relationships and connections, which might also include exploring her own emotional landscape.
