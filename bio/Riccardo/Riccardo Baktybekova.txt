He is known for being humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand to fellow artists or share his knowledge with those seeking guidance. Despite his success, Riccardo remains grounded and true to his artistic vision, never losing sight of the wisdom Yumi imparted upon him: "Art is not just about creating something beautiful; it's about sharing your soul with others." He has a strong sense of community and values collaboration, often working with other artists to create innovative pieces that blend traditional techniques with modern elements.

**Interests:** Riccardo is deeply fascinated by traditional Japanese calligraphy, paper crafts, and ancient art forms. He spends hours researching and experimenting with new techniques, always seeking to push the boundaries of his craft. When not creating art, Riccardo enjoys exploring Tokyo's hidden alleys and discovering new vendors and artists who share his passion for unique craftsmanship.
