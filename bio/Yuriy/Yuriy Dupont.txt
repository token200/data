Despite this, Yuriy has a quiet confidence that borders on arrogance, which can sometimes make it difficult for those around him to get close.

**Interests:** As a renowned physicist, Yuriy Dupont's interests are centered around the mysteries of the universe. He is particularly fascinated by quantum entanglement and spends most of his free time reading scientific papers, attending lectures, or conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory. When not working on his latest project, he enjoys stargazing, lost in thought as he contemplates the vast expanse of space and time. This hobby helps him clear his mind and tap into his creative subconscious.
