Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Laura Alsbach:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a loose, curly bob
- Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a warm glow from spending time outdoors

**Personality:** Laura is an adventurous and fearless individual who embodies the spirit of discovery. Her innate curiosity and passion for geology drive her to push boundaries and explore uncharted territories. She's fiercely independent, determined, and has a strong sense of self-motivation. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

**Interests:** Laura's love for geology knows no bounds. Her hobbies include:

- Rock collecting and studying
- Hiking and mountaineering
- Archaeological exploration
- Reading about history and mythology
- Photography, particularly capturing the beauty of natural landscapes

Laura is also an avid writer and keeps a journal to record her thoughts, observations, and insights gathered during her expeditions. She's been known to write poetry and short stories inspired by her travels and discoveries.

**Background:** Laura grew up in a family of scientists and explorers. Her father, a renowned geologist himself, instilled in her the importance of curiosity and exploration from a young age. She pursued a career in geology, eventually becoming a respected expert in her field. Despite her many accomplishments, she remains humble and true to her roots, always seeking to learn more about the world around her.

**Quirks:** Laura has a habit of collecting small stones or pebbles at every new location she visits, which serves as a reminder of her journey. She's also known to speak in a soft, raspy voice when excited about a discovery, a trait inherited from her father.
