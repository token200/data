Laura Alighieri was born into a family of modest means but possessed an exceptional mind and spirit. She stood at 5'8" with piercing emerald eyes and long, curly brown hair, often adorned with intricate braids and pins. Her sharp jawline and determined expression gave her an air of confidence that commanded attention.

As a young woman, Laura was fascinated by the world of art and music. She spent countless hours practicing the violin and learning classical poetry from the greatest masters of the time.
