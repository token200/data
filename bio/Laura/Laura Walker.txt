Here's a summary of Laura Walker's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Laura is a reserved and introspective person who has always preferred to keep to herself. Despite this, she has an uncanny ability to sense the emotions of those around her, which makes her seem more empathetic and perceptive than initially meets the eye. Her reserved nature hides a depth of feeling that only reveals itself when she's faced with someone like Jack, who is able to see through her mask and connect with her on a deeper level.

**Physical Attributes:** Laura is a tall and slender woman with piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a thousand secrets. Her raven-black hair falls down her back like a waterfall of night, framing her pale skin and striking features. She has an understated elegance about her, but one that can be deceiving - beneath the surface lies a complex and sensitive soul.

**Interests:** Laura's interests are largely centered around books, which she devours with voracious enthusiasm. However, it was not until she met Jack that she began to explore other passions and hobbies, including restoring and selling vintage items at her father's antique shop. Her work as an antiquarian has become a source of comfort and solace for her, allowing her to channel her energy into creating something beautiful from discarded objects. She is also drawn to the supernatural and the mysterious, which draws her to practices like meditation and tuning in to whispers on the wind.

It can be noted that Laura's past was intentionally left vague, thus making her a complex character, shrouded with mystery, much like herself.
