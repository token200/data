Here's a summary of the fictional character Malia Faust:

**Physical Attributes:** Malia Faust stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, a trait that sets her apart from humans due to her mutant abilities. She has a small tattoo of a circuit board on her left wrist.

**Personality:** Malia is a complex and introspective individual with a tough exterior that hides a deep sense of vulnerability. Despite being a powerful mutant with the ability to control technology, she has always felt like an outsider due to the fear and persecution she faced from humans. As a result, Malia has become fiercely independent and self-reliant, but this also makes her struggle with forming close relationships. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a deep sense of loneliness and longing for human connection.

**Interests:** Malia's interests include tinkering with technology, exploring the city at night, and reading books on history and mythology. She is particularly fascinated by the concept of curses and pacts, given her own surname "Faust" and its association with the legendary figure who made a pact with Mephistopheles. Malia also has a passion for photography, often capturing moments of beauty in the city's underbelly.

**Background:** Growing up as a mutant in a world where humans fear and hunt those like her, Malia learned to rely only on herself. She has had limited contact with her family due to their safety concerns and her own desire for independence. Despite this, she holds onto memories of happier times with her loved ones and dreams of reuniting with them one day.

Overall, Malia Faust is a deeply nuanced character who navigates the complexities of being a mutant in a human-dominated world. Her story is one of self-discovery, loneliness, and the search for connection and belonging.
