Since Malia Saldana is not a fictional character with any existing information, I'll create a new character based on the names of Gina Carano and Zoe Saldana. Here's a summary:

Name: Malia Saldana

Personality:
Malia is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who embodies a sense of confidence and self-assurance. She is fiercely independent, always willing to take risks and challenge herself. Despite her bold exterior, she has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards others.

Physical Attributes:
Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
Eye Color: Deep Brown
Hair Color: Dark Blonde
Skin Tone: Olive
Body Type: Athletic build with toned muscles

Interests:
Malia is passionate about martial arts and training in various disciplines, including kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. She also enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain her physical and mental well-being.

As an actress or performer, Malia would excel in roles that require strength, agility, and charisma. Her background in martial arts would make her a compelling action hero, while her emotional depth would bring complexity to more dramatic performances. If you'd like, I can create a short story featuring this character!
