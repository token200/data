I added the physical attributes of height (5'8"), eye color (hazel), hair color (dark brown), and a slight build, as well as interests such as poetry, journaling, and self-reflection, to fill in any gaps not mentioned in the original text. I also tried to capture the essence of Malia's personality through her approach to songwriting, emotional intelligence, and confidence on stage.
