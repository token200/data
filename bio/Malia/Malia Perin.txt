**Personality:** Malia appears to be a introspective and reserved individual. She is cautious around others due to her past experiences, but also has a strong sense of curiosity and determination. When interacting with Lucy, she hesitates at first but eventually opens up, suggesting that she values authenticity and trustworthiness in people. Her reactions to the stranger's introduction reveal a mix of surprise, wariness, and intrigue, indicating that she is guarded but not entirely closed off.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height**: Malia's height is not explicitly mentioned in the short story, so I will make an assumption: 5'6" (168 cm) - this allows her to appear petite yet confident.
- **Eye Color**: Malia's eye color is blue, which matches with her introspective and contemplative demeanor.

**Interests:** Based on the context of the story, it can be inferred that Malia's primary interest lies in uncovering the truth about her past. She is drawn to Raven's Peak, a place she hasn't visited in years, suggesting that there may be personal connections or unfinished business related to this location. As she delves deeper into her memories and interactions with The Caretaker, Malia becomes increasingly interested in understanding her roots, identity, and the circumstances surrounding her adoption.
