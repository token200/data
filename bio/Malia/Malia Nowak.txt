Since Malia Nowak is not a real character, I'll create a fictional profile for her. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Malia Nowak is a 25-year-old woman with an athletic build. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, which is slightly above average height. Her hair is dark brown, straight, and falls just below her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait she inherited from her Polish ancestry.

**Personality:**
Malia is a driven and ambitious individual with a strong sense of determination. She's fiercely independent and values self-reliance above all else. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect those she cares about. Malia is also highly intelligent and resourceful, often relying on her wits to navigate complex situations.

**Interests:**
Malia is an avid reader with a love for science fiction and fantasy novels. She's particularly fond of authors like J.R.R. Tolkien and George R.R. Martin. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga and hiking in the nearby mountains. Malia is also an accomplished painter, often incorporating elements of nature into her art.

Now that I've created a fictional profile for Malia Nowak, please let me know if you'd like to proceed with writing a 400-word story about her!
