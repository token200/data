Since the provided short story does not mention Fadumo Luis Borges, I will create a new character.

Fadumo Luis Borges is a 25-year-old Somali writer and poet. As for her physical attributes, she stands at 5'8" with dark brown hair and expressive hazel eyes. Her warm, golden-brown skin is a testament to her Somali heritage.

Personality-wise, Fadumo is a deeply introspective and creative individual. She has a dry sense of humor and can often be found lost in thought, observing the world around her. Despite her reserved nature, she has a strong passion for social justice and is not afraid to speak her mind on issues that matter to her.

In terms of interests, Fadumo is an avid reader and writer, with a particular fondness for poetry and short stories. She is also a skilled photographer and enjoys capturing the beauty of her native Somalia through her lens. When she's not creating art, Fadumo can be found practicing yoga or hiking in the hills surrounding her hometown.

Fadumo's love of language and literature has taken her on a journey to study at various universities, including the University of Oxford and the University of Copenhagen. This exposure has broadened her perspective and fueled her desire to use her words to tell stories that need to be told.

Overall, Fadumo Luis Borges is a complex and multifaceted individual with a rich inner life and a deep commitment to using her talents to make a positive impact on the world around her.
