Based on the story, I have created a fictional character profile for Yang ≈Åawniczak:

* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a neatly trimmed beard

* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing hazel eyes that seem to gleam with curiosity

**Personality:**

* Yang is an introverted and analytical individual who finds solace in the vast expanse of space. He is intensely focused on his work and often loses himself in the pursuit of knowledge.
* Despite being a brilliant mind, Yang struggles with social interactions, finding it difficult to connect with people outside of the scientific community.
* He has a dry sense of humor, often using irony and sarcasm to deflect from his intense feelings or awkward situations.
* As he grew older, Yang's dedication to his work led to feelings of isolation, causing him to become withdrawn and reclusive.

**Interests:**

* Collecting rare scientific texts and manuscripts from renowned astronomers
* Meditating and practicing mindfulness to clear his mind and focus on the task at hand

**Goals:**
