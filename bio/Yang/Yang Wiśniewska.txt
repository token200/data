Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a new character profile for Yang Wiśniewska:

**Physical Attributes:**
Yang Wiśniewska is a 25-year-old Polish journalist with a petite build and an energetic presence. She stands at approximately 5'4" (162 cm) with long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a curtain of night. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with curiosity, revealing a sharp intellect and a quick wit. Her features are delicate yet determined, framing a face that lights up with enthusiasm whenever she's immersed in her work.

**Personality:**
Yang Wiśniewska is an inquisitive and driven individual with a passion for uncovering hidden stories and secrets. She has an innate curiosity that drives her to explore the unknown and challenge the status quo. Her natural warmth and kindness make her an instant favorite among those she meets, whether it's a fellow journalist or a shy local resident. Yang Wiśniewska is fiercely independent, yet has a soft spot for underdogs and marginalized voices.

**Interests:**
Yang Wiśniewska is an avid reader of Polish literature, particularly the works of Witold Gombrowicz and Bruno Schulz. She's also a fan of classical music, often listening to Chopin's nocturnes while working on her stories. In her free time, she enjoys experimenting with traditional Polish recipes in Jadwiga's bakery, learning about the intricacies of pastry-making, and exploring the city's lesser-known neighborhoods.

**Additional Details:**
Yang Wiśniewska was born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, where she developed a deep affection for the city's rich history, vibrant culture, and resilient people. She comes from a family of modest means, but her parents encouraged her curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit, which led her to pursue a career in journalism. As she navigates the complexities of her story, Yang Wiśniewska will discover that her own identity is intertwined with the secrets she uncovers about Marek's enigmatic bakery and its mysterious past.
