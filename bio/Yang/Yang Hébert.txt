I'd be delighted to create a character profile for Yang Hébert. Here's what I came up with:

**Personality:** Yang Hébert is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who lives life on her own terms. She has a passion for exploration, trying new experiences, and taking calculated risks. Despite her bold nature, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. Yang has a dry sense of humor and often uses wit and sarcasm to defuse tense situations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright green
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a messy bob with subtle layers framing her face
* Skin Tone: Smooth, olive-toned complexion with a warm golden undertone
* Body Type: Athletic and toned, with a collection of scars from past adventures

**Interests:** Yang is an avid traveler, geologist, and rock climber. She has a deep fascination with the natural world and spends most of her free time studying geological formations, trying new outdoor activities, or planning her next adventure. She is also a skilled photographer and loves capturing stunning landscapes through her lens.

Additional details:

* Yang was born in New Zealand to parents from different cultural backgrounds.
* She has a unique tattoo on her left wrist – a small geode with the phrase " Terra Firma" (Latin for "solid earth") etched into it.
* Despite her love for adventure, Yang is also a bookworm and devours science fiction novels and poetry collections in her free time.

Feel free to modify or add to this character profile as you see fit! I hope this gives you a good starting point for your story.
