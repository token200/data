Here is a summary of Yang Nowakowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Yang Nowakowska stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with curiosity when she's examining a new art piece. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a neat bun, revealing a small tattoo of a painter's brush on her left wrist - a memento from her time studying art history in college.

**Personality:**
Yang is a passionate and driven individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She has an insatiable curiosity about the world around her, particularly when it comes to art, history, and culture. Her love for learning is contagious, and she often finds herself getting lost in conversations with fellow historians and artists. Despite her strong will, Yang is not one to shy away from vulnerability or emotional depth - she wears her emotions like a badge of honor.

**Interests:**
Yang's true passions lie at the intersection of art history, cultural heritage, and personal family legacy. She is deeply fascinated by the stories of her ancestors and spends countless hours researching and writing about the lives of Polish artists, particularly women who paved their own paths in a male-dominated field. When she's not working or studying, Yang loves to get lost in museum exhibitions, attending lectures on art conservation, or practicing painting (albeit with limited skill). Her greatest joy comes from uncovering long-lost family secrets and unraveling the mysteries of Poland's rich cultural heritage.
