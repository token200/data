Here is a summary of Yang Yumi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yang Yumi is a mysterious and elusive individual, known for her enigmatic nature. She exudes an aura of calmness and composure, which makes her even more intimidating to those who dare cross her path. Despite her deadly reputation, she possesses a dry sense of humor and seems to take pleasure in outsmarting her enemies. Her professionalism and skillset make her a consummate perfectionist, always striving to improve her craft.

**Physical Attributes:** Yang Yumi stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of rigorous training and combat. Her eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost black in color, which seem to bore into those she meets. Her raven-black hair is often styled in a sleek, low ponytail, revealing the sharp contours of her cheekbones and angular features. She has a collection of scars on her arms and torso, testaments to her many battles.

**Interests:** Yang Yumi's interests are focused on mastering new skills and techniques in the art of combat, with an emphasis on stealth, deception, and strategy. She is an avid student of human behavior and psychology, often studying her prey before striking. Her favorite pastime is meditation, which helps her clear her mind and focus her thoughts. In rare moments of downtime, she enjoys listening to classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which evoke a sense of melancholy and introspection that resonates with her dark persona.

In terms of hobbies, Yang Yumi has little time for leisure activities, as her life is consumed by training, contracts, and survival. However, if forced to choose, she might enjoy the quiet satisfaction of planning a successful mission or outsmarting a worthy adversary, followed by a solitary walk in the mountains under the stars.
