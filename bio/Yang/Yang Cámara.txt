Based on the short story, here's a summary of Yang Cámara's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yang Cámara is a man of profound introspection and deep desire to understand the mysteries of existence. He is driven by curiosity and has seen centuries pass him by, making him somewhat disconnected from the world around him. Despite this, his spirit remains unbroken, indicating a strong sense of resilience. As someone who has lived for centuries, he must have accumulated wisdom, experience, and emotional depth, which suggests that he is not one to shy away from complex problems or uncomfortable emotions.

**Physical Attributes:** Yang Cámara appears to be an older man with an unkempt appearance, suggesting that he may not be particularly concerned with his physical appearance. In the story, there is no mention of his height, but based on the fact that he sits alone on a beach and interacts with Aria, it's likely that he has a commanding presence. His eyes are described as fixed on the horizon, implying that they are perhaps slightly worn or weary from a life well-lived.

However, since this information is not explicitly mentioned in the short story, I will make an assumption: Yang Cámara is likely in his late 50s to early 60s, with piercing brown eyes and graying hair. His appearance reflects his age and experience, but he still carries an air of intensity and presence that suggests a strong presence.

**Interests:** Given Yang Cámara's long lifespan, it's likely that he has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge across various disciplines. As someone who has lived for centuries, he must have had time to explore different fields, including philosophy, history, art, music, and science. His love of learning is evident in his introspection and desire to understand the mysteries of existence.

In addition to his intellectual pursuits, Yang Cámara's experiences as a lover suggest that he values passion, intimacy, and deep connections with others. He has likely been shaped by his past relationships, which have influenced his perspective on life and love.

Overall, Yang Cámara is a complex character with a rich inner life, driven by curiosity and a desire for understanding the mysteries of existence.
