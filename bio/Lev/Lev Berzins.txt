Here is a summary of Lev Berzins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lev is a sharp-witted and resourceful individual with a strong sense of determination and justice. He has a reputation for being one of the best private investigators in Moscow due to his exceptional analytical skills and ability to think outside the box.

Lev has a rugged and weathered appearance, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark brown hair is often mussed, giving him a slightly unkempt look.

**Interests:** Lev's interests are largely centered around his work as a private investigator and his desire to uncover the truth. He has a passion for puzzles and riddles, which often helps him in his investigations. Outside of work, he enjoys playing chess and poker, which allows him to exercise his strategic thinking skills.

This has led to a sense of paranoia and mistrust towards authority figures, which can sometimes make it difficult for him to form close relationships. Despite this, he remains fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly his clients and friends like Sofia's father.
