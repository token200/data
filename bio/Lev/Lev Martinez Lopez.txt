Here is a summary of Lev Martinez Lopez's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Lev is known for his unorthodox approach to gardening, which suggests that he is creative, open-minded, and willing to challenge conventional wisdom. He is also passionate about sharing his knowledge with others, as evidenced by his enthusiasm for teaching Sofia about urban gardening. Additionally, Lev's calm and soothing demeanor can be inferred from the way he shares stories of his abuela and explains the importance of resilience in nature.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details are provided in the story about Lev's height or eye color, so I will make an educated guess:

* Height: Lev is likely a bit above average height, around 5'10" to 6'0", which would allow him to move comfortably around his rooftop greenhouse.
* Eye Color: Given Lev's Latin American heritage and the fact that Sofia stops by the greenhouse with a professional air about her, I'll assume Lev has dark eyes, such as brown or hazel.

**Interests:** As a horticulturist, Lev is clearly passionate about plants and gardening. He has a deep appreciation for urban gardens and sees them as opportunities to bring life and beauty to unexpected places. His interests also extend to sharing knowledge with others, teaching Sofia about the importance of resilience in nature, and spreading his grandmother's message of hope and adaptation.

Additional details that can be inferred from the story:

* Lev is likely a bit of a introvert or has been socialized to be comfortable in his own company, as evidenced by the fact that he is happy to share his knowledge with Sofia but also values his alone time.
* Lev has a strong connection to his abuela and her lessons about nature, which suggests that family and heritage play an important role in his life.
