Based on the short story, here is a summary of Lev Wisniewski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Lev Wisniewski is a complex and multifaceted individual. On one hand, he has a passion for numbers and a dedication to his craft that borders on intensity. This focus has led him to spend most of his days locked away in his office, pouring over equations and theorems. Despite this, he is also shown to be a quiet and introspective person who struggles with anxiety and depression. He is not sociable, preferring solitude to interactions with others, but this does not mean he lacks empathy or understanding.

Physical Attributes: Lev Wisniewski is a tall man, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) according to the story. His eye color is described as blue, which suggests a calm and introspective demeanor.

Interests: As a brilliant mathematician, Lev's primary interest is mathematics, particularly fractal geometry. He is intensely focused on his work, spending hours, days, or even weeks working on a single equation until it yields its secrets. This dedication to his craft has come at a cost, however, as he often struggles with feelings of disconnection and solitude.

It's worth noting that the story does not provide much information about Lev's interests outside of mathematics, so this summary is largely based on his profession and personality traits.
