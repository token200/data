Here's a summary of Lev Bergstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lev is a creative and empathetic individual who values deep connections with others. He is an active listener and has a calming presence, which makes him an excellent confidant for Lena. Despite his artistic nature, he is also practical and down-to-earth, as evident in his conversation about his art project. Lev's feelings for Lena are complex, and he struggles to express them openly.

**Physical Attributes:** Lev stands at 5'10" with a lean build, allowing him to move easily between art supplies and everyday life. His brown hair is often unruly, and he runs his hands through it when feeling anxious or deep in thought. His eye color is a warm, honey-brown that seems to hold a deep understanding of those around him.

**Interests:** Lev is an artist at heart, with a passion for capturing the decay and beauty of urban landscapes in his paintings. He is deeply inspired by the city's industrial history and sees it as a reflection of human nature - full of contrasts and contradictions. When not creating art, Lev enjoys exploring the city on foot, observing the way light falls on buildings and textures of old structures. His interest in music and writing is also evident, with Lena sharing her own creative endeavors with him during their conversation.

In addition to his artistic interests, Lev seems to appreciate the quiet moments of introspection and contemplation, often found in nature or while lost in thought. He values meaningful connections with others and is not afraid to show vulnerability when needed, as seen in his tender moment with Lena outside the coffee shop.
