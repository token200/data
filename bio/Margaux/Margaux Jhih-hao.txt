**Personality:** Margaux is known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, traits that have earned her a reputation as one of the most formidable opponents in competitive gaming. She is highly intelligent and resourceful, with exceptional reflexes and razor-sharp instincts. Despite her confidence on the battlefield, she struggles with social interactions outside of the gaming community, feeling isolated and unsure how to form meaningful connections.

**Physical Attributes:** Margaux stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, a deep blue hue that seems almost purple in the right light. She has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of intense gaming and physical activity.

**Interests:** Margaux is passionate about competitive gaming, particularly the game "Eclipse," which she plays with incredible skill and speed. When not competing or writing, she enjoys reading fantasy novels and exploring the Pacific Northwest's natural beauty. She also has a secret love for photography, using her camera to capture the world around her and express herself creatively.

As LunarStar, Margaux continues to excel in competitive gaming, but as a person, she is more reserved, using her art and writing as an outlet for self-expression and emotional balance.
