Based on the short story, here is a summary of Amalia Durand's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Amalia Durand is a complex individual with a dark past. She has built walls around herself due to her painful divorce from her wealthy husband, which has led to feelings of emptiness and disconnection. However, she also possesses a deep desire for human connection and understanding, as seen in her instant attraction to Luca. Despite her best efforts to hide behind a mask of elegance and refinement, Amalia is vulnerable and open to the possibility of new experiences and relationships.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright green with golden flecks
* Hair: Raven-black, shoulder-length

**Interests:** As a former socialite, Amalia has likely had exposure to various high-end activities and events. Her interests may include:

* Fine art and collecting rare pieces
* High-end fashion and design
* Luxury travel and cultural experiences
* Reading literature and poetry (given her appreciation for Luca's artistic nature)

However, it's also clear that Amalia has been lacking in meaningful connections and personal growth. As she begins to open up to Luca, we may see a renewed interest in:

* Creative pursuits (e.g., writing, painting) as a way to express herself and process her emotions
* Outdoor activities or wellness practices (e.g., yoga, hiking) to cope with stress and find inner peace
* Building new relationships and community connections, possibly through Luca's influence

Overall, Amalia's personality is a mix of elegance and vulnerability, with a deep-seated desire for connection and understanding.
