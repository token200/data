Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Amalia Hébert:

**Personality:** Amalia is an enigmatic individual with an air of quiet confidence. She has a way of commanding attention without being loud or boisterous. Despite her success as an artist, she remains aloof and guarded, often finding it difficult for people to get close to her. However, those who have breached her defenses, like Jack, understand that this is just a defense mechanism protecting the tender shoots of her heart.

**Physical Attributes:** Amalia is likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eye color is an intense, piercing green that seems to gleam with intensity when she talks about her art.

**Interests:** Amalia's primary interest is in creating art, particularly paintings that explore the unconventional and unknown. She has a fascination with eerie landscapes and figures that seem to shift and writhe like living things. Her artwork often reflects this fascination, making her stand out from other artists.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, it seems that music or dance might be an interest of hers, as there are rumors about her secret talent for these arts. However, Amalia herself has only hinted at exploring these interests, suggesting that they remain a private passion.

One thing is clear: Amalia's creative energy and passion drive her to produce work that is raw, emotional, and captivating – much like the painting she revealed to Jack in their studio.
