**Interests:** Pauline is deeply invested in the social scene, making it her top priority. She has an unparalleled knowledge of everyone's deepest secrets, which fuels her passion for gossip and drama. However, as hinted at by the elderly woman's kind words, there may be more to Pauline's interests than just superficial social connections. Perhaps she finds solace in the intricate web of relationships and stories that unfold within the town's social circle.

It is also possible that Pauline has a more creative or artistic side, which might not be immediately apparent due to her dominant role as a gossipmonger. This could be an area where she finds freedom and self-expression outside of the spotlight, perhaps in writing, painting, or some other form of creative expression.
