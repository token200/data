- Skin Tone: Porcelain doll-like complexion with a subtle scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose
- Body Type: Slender, yet athletic build, with broad shoulders and a petite waist

**Personality:**
Édith Mägi is an enigmatic and introspective individual, preferring the comfort of solitude to the demands of social interaction. She is fiercely independent and values her alone time, which she uses to fuel her creativity. Despite her reclusive nature, Édith has a deep empathy for others and is drawn to those who share her passion for art. Her wit is dry and sarcastic, often catching people off guard with its sharpness.

**Interests:**
Édith's primary interest lies in creating vibrant, emotional art that reflects the world around her. She spends most of her days lost in thought, as she pours her emotions onto canvas. Her art is a reflection of her fascination with nature - the colors, textures, and patterns that surround her cottage are all inspirations for her work. Édith is also deeply interested in psychology and philosophy, often finding solace in the works of great thinkers like Nietzsche and Freud.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Édith has a quiet passion for gardening and botany, which she uses as a way to connect with nature and clear her mind. Her studio is a testament to her creativity, filled with half-finished canvases, scattered paints, and an assortment of peculiar trinkets collected from her travels.

Édith's love of solitude has led her to become something of a hermit, preferring the quiet company of animals - particularly cats - over that of humans. Despite this, she remains open to connecting with like-minded individuals, as seen in her relationship with Lena and her willingness to share her art and thoughts with others.
