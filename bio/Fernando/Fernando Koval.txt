Here is a summary of the fictional character Fernando Koval:

**Physical Attributes:** Fernando is a tall and lean individual, standing at around 6'1" with an athletic yet wiry build. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a deep intensity, and his jet-black hair is often tousled as if he's just rolled out of bed. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rugged allure.

**Personality:** Fernando exudes quiet confidence and carries an air of mystery that draws people in. As a former detective, he has seen the darkest corners of human nature and yet remains unbroken. His art is a reflection of this resilience, as he pours his heart and soul into vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes. Despite being introverted, Fernando is deeply empathetic and can sense the pain and turmoil that lies beneath someone's surface.

**Interests:** As an artist, Fernando finds solace in the world of color and emotion. He is drawn to abstract expressionism and figurative art, often incorporating elements of surrealism into his work. His studio is a sanctuary where he can escape the noise of the city and tap into his creative subconscious. Outside of art, Fernando is a voracious reader and has a deep love for literature and poetry, which influences his work and provides him with inspiration.

**Other:** Fernando's past as a detective has left its mark on him, and he struggles to find purpose in an art world that often prioritizes showmanship over substance. He is fiercely independent and values his alone time, but when the right person comes along – like Sofia – he finds himself opening up and sharing his story. This vulnerability marks a turning point for Fernando, as he begins to see his art not just as a reflection of himself but also as a way to connect with others.
