**Interests:** Fernando's true passion is collecting antique door knobs, which he believes hold the secrets and stories of human ingenuity and craftsmanship. He has an insatiable curiosity about the past and is drawn to the unique history behind each knob, from 18th-century European carvings to industrial machinery from post-war America.
