Here is a summary of Fernando Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Fernando Mikhailov stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often worn long and unkempt, framing his sharp features. His eyes are piercing blue, a trait he inherited from his Eastern European heritage. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many missions.

**Personality:**
Fernando exudes an air of quiet confidence that is both captivating and unnerving. As "The Ghost," he had spent years honing his skills as a spy and intelligence operative, earning him a reputation for being ruthless yet calculating. However, after leaving the world of espionage behind, Fernando has channeled this intensity into his art, using it to fuel his creative expression. He is intensely focused and analytical, able to piece together seemingly unrelated threads with ease.

Despite his formidable background, Fernando is introspective and emotionally guarded, having spent years suppressing his emotions to protect himself from getting too close to others. However, when he sets his mind on a task, he becomes laser-focused and driven, often neglecting everything else in his life for the sake of the mission.

**Interests:**
Fernando's passion lies in art, particularly painting and drawing. He has spent years honing his skills in his small studio apartment in Paris, where he now resides. He finds solace in the creative process, using it to express himself and channel his emotions. His artwork often features themes of darkness, shadow, and the human condition.

In addition to art, Fernando is a voracious reader and has an encyclopedic knowledge of history, politics, and international relations. His vast network of connections from his spy days still serves him well in gathering information and tracking down leads.

Fernando's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his experiences as a spy and operative. He enjoys playing jazz music on the saxophone, collecting rare books, and taking long walks along the Seine River, where he often lost himself in thought and reflection.
