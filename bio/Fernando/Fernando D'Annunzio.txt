Based on the inspiration provided by Gabriele D'Annunzio's story, I have created a fictional character profile for Fernando D'Annunzio:

Physical Attributes:
Fernando D'Annunzio stands at 6 feet (183 cm) tall with an athletic yet lean build. His dark brown hair is often styled in a slicked-back manner, accentuating his piercing emerald eyes that seem to burn with intensity when he speaks. He sports a well-groomed beard and mustache, adding to his air of authority.

Personality:
Fernando D'Annunzio exudes charisma and confidence, often using his wit and charm to win over crowds. As a passionate advocate for independence and freedom, he has a natural ability to inspire devotion in those around him. However, beneath this polished exterior lies a complex web of emotions and motivations that can be both captivating and unsettling.

Interests:
Fernando D'Annunzio is an ardent lover of poetry, music, and the arts. He sees these creative pursuits as essential components of his vision for an independent Fiume (or any other city-state he might envision). His love for literature often draws him to works by prominent Italian authors like Dante Alighieri or Alessandro Manzoni, who embody the ideals of national pride and civic duty.

In addition to his artistic interests, Fernando D'Annunzio is also drawn to politics, particularly those that emphasize individual freedom and self-determination. He is fiercely loyal to Italy's cultural heritage but harbors deep-seated criticisms of its slow pace of progress. When these concerns come to a head, he channels his energies into action, often walking the fine line between heroism and authoritarianism.

As a young man, Fernando D'Annunzio was an avid traveler, studying languages, history, and literature throughout Europe and beyond. These experiences broadened his perspective and fostered his conviction that there must be more to life than mere conformity and stifling bureaucracy.

This fictional profile captures the essence of Gabriele D'Annunzio's character while weaving in new details that enhance the mythology surrounding Fernando D'Annunzio, a name that seems eerily similar yet distinct from its historical counterpart.
