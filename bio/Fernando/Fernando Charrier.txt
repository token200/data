Here's a summary of Fernando Charrier's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Fernando is a complex character with a mix of qualities. On the surface, he appears to be a successful businessman with wealth, influence, and a beautiful wife. However, beneath this fa√ßade, he feels empty and unfulfilled, suggesting that he has some emotional depth and introspection. He's also shown to be introspective and reflective, as evidenced by his feelings of guilt and relief when talking to Sofia about his struggles.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Black

No specific details are given about Fernando's physical attributes beyond height and eye color. It can be inferred that he has dark hair, which is common in people from Latin American countries like Argentina.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that art was a significant passion for Fernando in his youth. He spent hours sketching and painting as a child, and this creative outlet sparked his imagination. As an adult, however, he seems to have lost touch with this passion due to the demands of his family business.

Given the setting of Buenos Aires, it's likely that Fernando has an appreciation for Argentine culture, including music, food, or other art forms. His love of the city and its energy is evident in his description of watching the sunset over the bustling streets.

While Fernando's current interest in art is limited to painting, it's possible that he might explore other creative outlets as well, such as photography, writing, or even design. The fact that Sofia encourages him to pursue his dreams suggests that he has a supportive partner who can help him rediscover his passions.
