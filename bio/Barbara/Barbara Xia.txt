**Physical Attributes:** Barbara Xia stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with striking features that set her apart. Her eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost purple in hue, which seems to hold an otherworldly intensity. Her hair is a wild tangle of curly brown locks that often escapes the loose bun she wears, framing her heart-shaped face and pointed chin. She has a collection of colorful tattoos on her arms and shoulders, each one telling a story of its own.

**Personality:** Barbara Xia is an enigmatic figure with a tumultuous personality that mirrors her art. She is deeply introspective and struggles to open up to those around her, making her appear mysterious and elusive. Despite this, she has a deep sense of vulnerability and empathy, which drives her creative process. Barbara is fiercely individualistic and refuses to be bound by convention, embracing her uniqueness with unapologetic fervor.

**Interests:** Barbara's interests are deeply rooted in art, music, and literature. She is an avid collector of rare books and vintage art pieces, often spending hours poring over ancient texts and lost masterpieces.

Music plays a significant role in Barbara's creative process, as she often listens to classical compositions or jazz standards while painting.

**Habits:** Barbara has a habit of talking to herself when lost in thought, much to the chagrin of those around her. She is also prone to bursts of creativity, where she will spend hours working on a single piece without taking a break. When feeling anxious or overwhelmed, she turns to tea, often brewing a pot of green tea to calm her nerves.

**Quirks:** Barbara has an uncanny ability to recall fragments of her dreams and nightmares with unsettling clarity. She is also fascinated by the concept of liminality – the space between reality and fantasy – which she believes holds the key to unlocking human potential. This fascination often leads her to experiment with unconventional art forms, blurring the lines between paint and performance.

**Goals:** Barbara's ultimate goal is to create a body of work that captures the essence of Tokyo's hidden corners and secrets. She hopes to use her art as a way to reconcile her fragmented past and find meaning in the chaos of her own existence.
