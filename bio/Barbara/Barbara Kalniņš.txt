**Interests:** Barbara is passionate about investigative journalism, creative writing, and exploring the unconventional side of human experience. When she discovers something new or intriguing, she can't resist diving headfirst into it, using her journalistic skills to dig deeper and uncover more secrets. Her interests also extend to music, art, and performance, which were awakened by her encounter with Kārlis's underground collective.
