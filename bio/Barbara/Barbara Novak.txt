Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Barbara Novak:

**Personality:** Barbara appears to be a polished and confident individual, able to navigate the complex world of high society with ease. However, beneath her outward confidence lies a complex web of emotions and secrets, hinting at a deeper sense of restlessness and discontent. She is likely a highly intelligent and witty person, able to hold her own in intellectual conversations. Despite her polished exterior, she struggles with finding purpose outside of her marriage and feels trapped by societal expectations.

**Physical Attributes:** Barbara's physical appearance is not explicitly described in the story, but based on the context, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Average or above average height (possibly around 5'8"-6'0") to be seen as a strong presence in high society.
* Eye Color: Blue eyes, possibly with a hint of green or brown, which would complement her polished and sophisticated demeanor.

**Interests:** Barbara's interests appear to be centered around:

* High society events and charity work (as she attends cocktail parties and galas)
* Politics and current affairs (as the wife of a powerful congressman)
* Intellectually stimulating conversations (as evidenced by her late-night phone calls with Emma and her discussions with Rachel)

However, it is also clear that Barbara feels unfulfilled in these areas and yearns for something more meaningful. Her interest in finding purpose outside of her marriage and forging her own path suggests a desire for personal growth, creativity, and individuality â€“ interests that are likely rooted in her relationship with her sister Emma.

Overall, Barbara appears to be a complex and multi-faceted individual, driven by both inner and outer forces that she is beginning to recognize and challenge.
