Here is a summary of the fictional character Antoni Nowak:

**Physical Attributes:** Antoni is a tall and lean individual, standing at around 6'1" with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp features. His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for any hidden clues. He has a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him an air of rugged intensity.

**Personality:** Antoni is a brooding and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of darkness and despair, which has left emotional scars that still linger. Despite this, he remains fiercely independent and determined to uncover the truth. He has a keen mind and sharp instincts, often relying on his gut feeling to guide him through complex cases. Antoni is also deeply empathetic and can't help but connect with those in need, as evident from his willingness to take on the case of the missing girl.

**Interests:** Outside of work, Antoni enjoys taking long walks in the rain, much like he did at the beginning of the story. He finds solace in these quiet moments, allowing him to clear his mind and process the emotions that often accompany his cases. He also has a fondness for old cigarettes and whiskey, which serve as companions to his solitary nights spent pouring over files and investigating leads.

**Additional Details:** Antoni's past is shrouded in mystery, with few details available about his personal life or family. However, it is clear that he has experienced trauma and loss at some point in his life, driving him to become the driven and resourceful investigator he is today. Despite this, there is a hint of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior, suggesting that Antoni may be more complex than initially meets the eye.
