Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Antoni Mikhailov:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Antoni Mikhailov stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a depth and intensity that can be unnerving to those who meet his gaze. His dark hair is always impeccably styled, framing his chiseled features and sharp jawline. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures.

**Personality:** 
Antoni Mikhailov is a complex and enigmatic individual with a dry sense of humor and an air of detachment that makes people feel uneasy. Despite this exterior, he has a deep passion for art, philosophy, and music, which he only reveals to those closest to him. He is fiercely intelligent and can think on his feet, making him a master thief who always seems one step ahead of his adversaries. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a romantic at heart, as evidenced by his lingering gazes on Sophie.

**Interests:**
Antoni Mikhailov has a deep appreciation for art (specifically, Renaissance art) and philosophy (he is particularly fond of existentialism). He is also an avid music lover, enjoying the works of Chopin and Debussy. As a thief, he has an expertise in various areas, including safe-cracking, lockpicking, and surveillance. In his free time, he enjoys traveling and exploring new cities, always on the lookout for his next adventure.

It's worth noting that Antoni Mikhailov is a master of manipulation and deception, so it's difficult to discern what is genuine about him and what might be a ruse to achieve his goals.
