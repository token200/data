Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Antoni Nilsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Antoni Nilsson is an eccentric and introverted individual with a passion for discovery. He is driven by his curiosity and obsession with the art of Alchemy, often to the point of obsession. Despite his intensity, he has a welcoming nature, as evident when he receives Emma into his study. His dedication to his craft is admirable, but also sometimes reckless, as seen in his numerous failed experiments.

**Physical Attributes:** Antoni is described as being alone in his dimly lit study, surrounded by dusty tomes and flickering candles. While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that he is a middle-aged man, likely in his late 40s or early 50s, given the level of experience and maturity depicted in the story.

Assuming an average height for a Swedish male, let's assign Antoni a height of around 5'10" (178 cm). His eye color is blue, which suits his Nordic heritage. No specific details are mentioned about his build or physical appearance beyond his limp, which he acquired during his sailing days.

**Interests:** As stated in the story, Antoni's primary interest lies in the art of Alchemy, a forbidden science rumored to hold the secrets of transmutation. He is an avid collector and researcher, spending years deciphering cryptic texts and testing his own theories. His collection includes rare spices, ancient artifacts, mysterious scrolls written in forgotten languages, jars of powdered herbs, and other related items.

Antoni's interests also extend beyond Alchemy itself, as he shares Emma's enthusiasm for the history of the subject. He values knowledge and discovery, which drives him to explore new ideas and debunk myths surrounding the art of Alchemy.
