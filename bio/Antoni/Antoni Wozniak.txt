Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Antoni Wozniak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Antoni Wozniak is a brilliant and reclusive inventor with an intense passion for discovery. He is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to unlock the secrets of the universe. Despite his eccentricities, he possesses a depth of intelligence that earns him a reputation as a mad scientist among his neighbors.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with an intensity that seems almost unnerving to those who meet him

**Interests:** Antoni's primary interest is in harnessing the power of the universe, which drives his obsessive pursuit of creating a machine capable of manipulating energy on a cosmic scale. He spends most of his life locked away in his cluttered workshop, where he pours over theories and conducts experiments that often leave others bewildered.

Additional details about Antoni's personality include:

* Eccentricity: Antoni is known for his outlandish behavior, which has led to whispers among the townspeople. Despite this, he remains undeterred, convinced that his genius will eventually be recognized.
* Obsessiveness: Antoni's fixation on the Cosmic Engine borders on fanatical. He spends every waking moment thinking about the machine, often neglecting basic needs and relationships in favor of his all-consuming quest.

In terms of interests outside of his workshop, it is unclear what drives Antoni or whether he has any hobbies or relationships beyond his work. However, given his reclusive nature, it's possible that even these aspects are deeply tied to his scientific pursuits.

It's worth noting that the short story presents a fragmented portrayal of Antoni's life, suggesting that there may be more depth to his personality than initially meets the eye. As the narrative continues, it will be interesting to explore the complexities and nuances of this enigmatic character further.
