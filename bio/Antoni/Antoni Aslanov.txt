**Physical Attributes:** Antoni Aslanov stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey look that frames his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small nose ring and a scattering of tattoos on his arms, reflecting his eclectic style.

**Personality:** Antoni is a deeply passionate and introspective person, driven by his love for music.

Despite this, he remains committed to his art, using music as a means of expressing himself and processing his emotions.

**Interests:** Music, of course, is Antoni's primary passion. He is a master pianist and composer, drawing inspiration from traditional Russian folk songs and classical piano pieces.
