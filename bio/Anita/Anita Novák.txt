Here is a summary of Anita Novák's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Anita Novák is a Hungarian-born sculptor in her late 60s. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, curly brown hair that she often wears in a loose bun. Her eyes are a deep, rich brown that seem to sparkle with creativity. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors, and she has a scattering of fine lines around her eyes and mouth that speak to her dedication to her craft.

**Personality:**
Anita is a fiercely independent and determined individual who values artistic freedom above all else. She is fiercely passionate about her work and is not afraid to take risks or challenge the status quo. Despite her success, she remains humble and unassuming, preferring to let her art speak for itself rather than seeking constant validation from others. Anita has a dry sense of humor and can come across as witty and urbane, but those who know her well understand that beneath her polished exterior lies a deep well of creativity and emotional depth.

**Interests:**
Anita is deeply interested in exploring the intersection of traditional techniques with modern sensibilities, which drives her unique style. She is also drawn to the way that art can be used as a tool for social commentary or to explore the human condition. In addition to sculpture, Anita has a strong interest in textiles and fashion, often incorporating fabric and other materials into her work. She is a voracious reader of literature and philosophy, and finds inspiration in the works of artists such as Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon.

In terms of hobbies, Anita enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's walking through the woods or exploring the city streets. She is also an avid traveler and has spent extensive periods of time living in different parts of Europe and North America, which has influenced her artistic style and perspective. When she's not working on a new piece, Anita can be found experimenting with different techniques, practicing yoga, or curled up with a good book and a cup of strong coffee.
