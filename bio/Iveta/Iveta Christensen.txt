**Personality:** Iveta appears to be a curious and determined individual. She has an insatiable desire to uncover the truth about her family's dark past, which suggests that she is driven by a sense of justice or a need for closure. At the same time, she shows compassion and understanding towards her mother, particularly when she finally understands the complexities of Helena's situation. This ability to balance tough questions with empathy indicates that Iveta is emotionally intelligent and able to navigate complex relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the original story. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the author's writing style:

* Age: 25 (as stated in the story)
* Height: Tall or above-average height, given the author's vivid descriptions of Iveta standing out against the backdrop of the old mansion
* Eye Color: Brown, as hinted by the description of Helena's eyes being "red-rimmed from crying" and Iveta's response to her mother's emotional state.

**Interests:** Based on Iveta's curiosity about her family's dark past, it can be inferred that she is interested in:

1. Investigative journalism or true crime: Iveta's desire to uncover the truth about the cult and its activities suggests that she has a strong interest in investigative journalism or the study of true crime cases.
2. Psychology or sociology: Her ability to understand her mother's motivations and emotions, as well as empathize with her experiences, implies that Iveta has an interest in psychology or sociology.
3. Family history or genealogy: The fact that Iveta is researching her family's past and seeking to understand the cult's influence on her mother suggests that she may be interested in exploring her own family history and ancestry.

Overall, Iveta appears to be a complex and multi-faceted individual with a strong desire for truth and understanding.
