Based on the inspiration from the short story, here's a summary of Clara Corberó's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Clara is a complex and introspective individual. She has a strong sense of justice and a deep desire to uncover truth, which drove her to become a detective. However, her experiences with corruption and politics led to disillusionment and ultimately, a breakdown. Despite this, she shows resilience and determination as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and healing. Clara is also introspective and emotional, as evident from her habit of staring blankly at the floorboards and writing in her journal.

**Physical Attributes:** While not explicitly described in the short story, we can make some educated guesses based on the author's style and the character's background. Here are a few assumptions:

* Height: Clara is likely around 5'6" to 5'8" (168 cm - 173 cm), which would have been typical for a woman in her late 20s or early 30s during the time period when she was a detective.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified, but based on her dark hair and Catalan heritage, it's possible that her eyes are brown or hazel.

**Interests:** Clara has a deep passion for writing and journaling. She finds solace in the quiet, introspective process of putting her thoughts and emotions into words. This hobby allows her to confront her demons and work through her feelings, as evident from her ability to write openly about her past traumas. Writing is also a therapeutic outlet for Clara, providing her with a sense of control and catharsis.

Other interests that can be inferred based on the character's background include:

* Reading: As an avid journaler, Clara likely enjoys reading books and articles related to psychology, self-improvement, or true crime.
* Nature: Her decision to leave her life behind and move to a remote rural area suggests that she values solitude and connection with nature. She might enjoy hiking, birdwatching, or simply spending time outdoors.
* Art: Clara's creative expression is evident in her writing, but it's possible that she also appreciates visual art forms like painting or photography.
