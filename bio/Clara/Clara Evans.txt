Here is a summary of Clara Evans' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Clara Evans is a brilliant, resourceful, and determined young journalist. She is sharp-minded, quick-witted, and tenacious, always on the lookout for the next big story. Her instincts are keen, and she has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to uncover the truth, no matter how difficult or complex.

**Physical Attributes:** Clara Evans stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing green eyes that sparkle with curiosity. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a neat ponytail, revealing a heart-shaped face and high cheekbones. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, symbolizing her passion for journalism.

**Interests:** Clara's interests are centered around investigative journalism, uncovering hidden truths, and shedding light on social injustices. She is fascinated by history, particularly the stories of industrial accidents and corporate cover-ups. In her free time, she enjoys reading about true crime cases, philosophy, and psychology. Clara is also an avid hiker and loves exploring abandoned places, much like the warehouse where her big break began.

It's worth noting that there is no mention of Clara's first name in the original story, but I've chosen to use "Mae" as a nod to her mother, as hinted at in the opening line.
