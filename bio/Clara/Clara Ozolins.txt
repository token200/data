Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Clara Ozolins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Clara is described as brilliant and resourceful. She is determined and brave, willing to take risks to uncover the truth. Her sharp instincts and quick thinking are evident in her ability to outsmart Echo's handler and escape the situation. She also shows a strong sense of justice, driven by a desire to expose secrets and bring attention to important issues.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details about Clara's physical appearance are provided in the story, except for one detail: her full name is Clara Ozolins. Based on this, I will make an educated guess that her height and eye color may be missing details as well. However, if we assume that she was mentioned along with her handler at the end of the story, it's possible that they were both around 5'9" to 6'0" (175 cm to 183 cm) in height.

Since I couldn't find any information on Clara's eye color, let's assume a common brown or hazel color for our fictional character. Please note this is purely speculative and based on the provided story only.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Clara's primary interest is in uncovering the truth and telling important stories to the public. Her drive for justice and her willingness to take risks suggest that she values fairness, integrity, and transparency above all else.

Outside of her work as a journalist, Clara may have interests such as:

1. Investigative journalism: She is clearly drawn to investigative work, using her skills to dig up information and expose wrongdoing.
2. Whistleblower protection: Given her experience with Echo's whistleblower, Clara may be interested in advocating for the rights and safety of whistleblowers.
3. Exposing corruption: Clara seems to have a strong sense of justice, which suggests that she is also interested in exposing corruption and abuse of power.

Overall, Clara Ozolins appears to be a smart, courageous, and driven individual who is not afraid to take risks or challenge authority when it comes to uncovering the truth.
