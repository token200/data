**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Yves stands at around 6'2" (188 cm), with an imposing yet unassuming presence.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. This piercing gaze is often accompanied by an air of quiet intensity, making him appear even more formidable.

**Interests:** As a renowned detective, Yves' interests lie primarily in solving crimes and uncovering the truth. He seems to have a strong passion for justice and a desire to see wrongdoers brought to account for their actions.
