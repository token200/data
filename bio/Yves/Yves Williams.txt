Based on the short story, here is a summary of Yves Williams' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yves has a complex web of emotions beneath his polished exterior. He appears to be charming and ruggedly handsome, but his past as a former soldier turned private investigator has left him with a sense of vulnerability and a mistrust of others. Despite this, he is determined and fiercely loyal to those he cares about, as evident in his willingness to help Sophia. Yves also seems to have a deep sense of justice, as he navigates the treacherous underworld of Parisian organized crime to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair: Dark brown, slightly messy
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a background in physical fitness from his military days
* Facial Features: Chiseled jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow

**Interests:** Yves appears to have a strong sense of justice and is driven by a desire to uncover the truth. As a private investigator, he has developed a keen instinct for detecting deception and manipulation. He is also shown to be resourceful and skilled in navigating complex social situations.

However, there are a few gaps in information that I've filled in with my own interpretation:

* Yves' voice: Although not explicitly mentioned, his smooth, commanding tone suggests a baritone voice.
* Personal habits: As he sips his espresso at the Caf√© des Anges, it's likely that Yves is also enjoying a quiet moment of contemplation or introspection.

Please note that these details are based on my interpretation of the short story and may not be explicitly stated in the text.
