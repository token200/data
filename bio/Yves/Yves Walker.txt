Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Yves Walker's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yves is a skilled and resourceful private investigator with a no-nonsense attitude. He has seen it all in his line of work, which makes him both jaded and driven to uncover the truth. Despite this, he shows a sense of empathy for those who are desperate or in danger, as evident when Marcel shares information about Sophie's case. Yves is also intelligent and analytical, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no detailed description of Yves' physical appearance in the provided text. However, based on his job as a private investigator and the scene where he pulls out a notebook and pen, it can be inferred that he is likely a man in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with some level of physical fitness.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, there is no mention of Yves' eye color in the provided text. However, given his job requirements and the fact that he doesn't seem to be intimidated by Marcel's menacing presence, it's possible that he has piercing eyes (e.g., blue or green) that convey confidence and authority.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Yves is likely interested in:

1. Solving mysteries and uncovering the truth
2. Helping those who are desperate or in danger
3. Uncovering illicit activities or crimes

Outside of his work, Yves may have interests such as:

1. Reading (he pulls out a notebook and pen, suggesting he might be a good reader)
2. Exercise or physical fitness (his job requires him to be physically active and agile)

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide enough information to fully flesh out Yves' personality, interests, and physical appearance. However, based on his actions and dialogue in the scene, these inferences can be made.
