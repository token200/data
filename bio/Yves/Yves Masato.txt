He is highly perceptive and calculating, always sizing up his surroundings and opponents before making a move. This intelligence makes him a skilled martial artist and assassin, but also leaves him emotionally guarded and detached from others.

Despite this, Yves has a deep sense of curiosity and a desire for self-discovery. When confronted with the truth about his past, he is initially reeling but eventually finds liberation in being free to forge his own path. This newfound freedom suggests that beneath his tough exterior lies a complex and multifaceted individual.

Outside of his work, Yves appears to be drawn to situations that challenge him or force him to confront his past.
