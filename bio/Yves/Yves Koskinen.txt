He has a sharp mind and keen instincts, which allows him to navigate the complexities of human nature with ease. He is driven by a sense of justice and becomes increasingly obsessed when investigating cases, particularly those involving vulnerable individuals like Sophia Laurent.

**Physical Attributes:**
Yves Koskinen is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with an athletic build that suggests he prioritizes physical health and fitness. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, which gives him a commanding presence in any setting. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, a piercing gaze that misses nothing.

**Interests:**
Yves Koskinen is deeply interested in solving mysteries and uncovering the truth behind unsolved cases. He is particularly drawn to cases involving vulnerable individuals or crimes that involve hidden motives or complex webs of deceit.

**Additional Details:**

He appears to be highly focused on his work and may have few hobbies or leisure activities outside of detective work.

It's also worth noting that Yves Koskinen seems to have a dry sense of humor, as suggested by the fact that he becomes "fixated" on finding Sophia Laurent - while this might not be a direct reference to his personal life, it could suggest a more introspective and analytical personality.
