Based on the provided short story, I have created a fictional profile for Yves Krūmiņa:

**Name:** Yves Krūmiņa
**Age:** 42
**Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)
**Eye Color:** Blue-Green (a rare shade that reflects his love for the Baltic Sea)

**Personality:**
Yves is a reclusive and introverted individual, preferring to spend most of his time alone in his study surrounded by books and papers. Despite his isolated nature, he has a deep passion for discovery and is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe. Yves is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, once you gain his trust, he reveals himself to be kind, humble, and intensely dedicated to his work.

**Interests:**
Yves's primary interest lies in mathematics, particularly fractals and chaos theory. He is deeply fascinated by the intricate patterns that govern our universe and spends countless hours studying and exploring their properties. Outside of academia, Yves enjoys sailing, reading classical literature, and playing the piano in his spare time.

**Physical Attributes (in addition to height and eye color):**
Yves has short, dark brown hair that is often unkempt and tousled. He sports a thin, wispy beard that he rarely trims. His style is casual and practical, reflecting his love for comfortable clothing and worn leather shoes. Yves's hands are stained with ink and pencil marks from hours of scribbling equations on chalkboards.
