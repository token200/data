Here's a summary of Yves Yan's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Yves Yan is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom beyond his age. His dark brown hair is slightly messy, framing his heart-shaped face. He has a lean build, honed from years of hard work and travel.

**Personality:** Yves is a introspective and creative person who wears his heart on his sleeve. Despite his rough exterior, he has a deep emotional wellspring that can be both a blessing and a curse. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking the road less traveled. At 35, he's at a crossroads in life, grappling with feelings of shame, guilt, and regret. As he navigates his way back to Ravenswood, Yves is slowly rediscovering his true self.

**Interests:** Yves has a passion for music, particularly folk and acoustic guitar. He's always been drawn to the stories and traditions behind each song, often seeking connection with the people who sang them. In his younger years, he was an avid writer and poet, but lost touch with these creative pursuits as he chased success.

Upon returning to Ravenswood, Yves is intrigued by the town's rich history and cultural heritage. He finds himself drawn to the local bakery, run by Madame Dupont, where he discovers a shared love for traditional recipes and folk music. As he settles back into his roots, Yves begins to explore the surrounding countryside, reconnecting with nature and rediscovering the joys of simple living.

In terms of hobbies, Yves is an avid gardener, particularly when it comes to ancient fruit trees like the cherry tree in Madame Dupont's garden. He finds solace in tending to these trees, watching them bloom, and savoring the fruits of his labor (literally!).
