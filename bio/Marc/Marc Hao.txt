He has a quiet and introspective nature, with a tendency to hold emotions close to the surface.

Marc is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, having retired from the police force after a traumatic event.

**Physical Attributes:** Marc Hao stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet imposing build. His hair is graying at the temples, giving him a distinguished air.

However, with the arrival of Sophie, a young journalist, Marc finds himself drawn back into the world of detection once more. He is also intrigued by human behavior and psychology, often finding himself lost in thought as he observes people around him.

Additionally, Marc has a fascination with the city of Paris, which seems to hold a special place in his heart. The streets of Paris are familiar to him, and he finds comfort in their rhythms and patterns.
