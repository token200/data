Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Marc Palmas:

**Personality:** Marc Palmas appears to be a introspective and resourceful individual. He has spent years drifting from one place to another, taking on odd jobs, and making appearances only when necessary, suggesting that he may be someone who is comfortable with solitude and isn't easily attached to people or places. However, as he delves deeper into his family's dark past, he shows a strong sense of determination and purpose, driven by a desire to uncover the truth and come to terms with his legacy.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown

**Interests:** Marc appears to be an amateur historian and researcher, as he spends countless nights pouring over dusty old records and scouring antique shops for clues. He also seems to have a strong interest in music, as hinted at by the whiskey sipping at a dive bar in New Orleans.

It's worth noting that not much is explicitly stated about Marc's personality beyond his introspection and resourcefulness, so some interpretation is required. Additionally, while his physical attributes are mentioned, they are relatively basic and don't reveal much about his overall character or demeanor.
