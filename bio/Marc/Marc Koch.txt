Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Marc Koch's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown with a hint of green
- Hair Color: Light brown, often styled neatly for professional occasions but occasionally worn in a messy, undone look when spending time with Emma.
- Build: Lean and fit, typical of someone who regularly exercises to maintain his busy lifestyle.

**Personality:**
Marc is a complex individual, appearing charming and affable on the surface but struggling with insecurities and doubts beneath. He is driven by a desire for control and success as a businessman, often hiding behind his confident exterior. However, once met with Emma, Marc begins to reveal his more vulnerable side, showcasing a deep longing for connection and understanding.

**Interests:**
- Business and finance (though not necessarily a source of personal fulfillment)
- Fine dining and wine
- High-profile charity events (partially due to professional obligations but also an attempt to present himself in the best possible light)

However, when spending time with Emma, Marc's interests shift towards more creative and spontaneous activities, such as:

- Exploring underground art shows
- Attending impromptu concerts
- Sharing moments of natural beauty together

These experiences bring out a new side of Marc, one that is more open to vulnerability, creativity, and genuine human connection.
