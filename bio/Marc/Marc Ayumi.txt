Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marc Ayumi either. To create a profile for this character, I'll make some assumptions and provide a summary.

**Physical Attributes:**
Marc Ayumi is a 25-year-old male of Japanese descent. He stands at about 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and cut in a stylish, textured manner that frames his face. His eyes are a deep, rich brown that seem to sparkle with warmth and kindness.

**Personality:**
Marc is a creative and adventurous person who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's a hopeless romantic at heart, always looking for the best in people and situations. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic when needed. Marc is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect and support them.

**Interests:**
Marc has a passion for photography, music, and travel. He loves capturing the beauty of the world around him through his lens and is always on the lookout for new inspiration. Music is a significant part of his life; he plays the guitar and sings in an indie rock band in his free time. Marc also enjoys hiking, trying new foods, and exploring different cultures.

**Background:**
Marc grew up in Tokyo, Japan, where he developed a love for Japanese culture, food, and traditions. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music and photography. He now splits his time between LA and Tokyo, balancing his creative pursuits with travel and adventure.
