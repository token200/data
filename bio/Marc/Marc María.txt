**Physical Attributes:** Marc María stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look endearingly disheveled. His eyes are an intense shade of hazel, with golden flecks that sparkle when he's excited about his art. He has a scattering of tattoos on his arms and shoulders, which he obtained during his rebellious teenage years.

**Personality:** Marc María is a free-spirited artist with a passion for life. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo to follow his own path. Despite this, he has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards others. He's quick-witted and enjoys bantering with friends, but can also be introverted and reflective when needed.

**Interests:** Marc María's interests are centered around art, music, and self-expression. When he's not painting or creating, you can find him:

* Exploring the winding streets of Barcelona, taking in the vibrant colors and textures of the city.
* Listening to traditional flamenco music, which inspires his art and fuels his passion for life.
* Attending underground art festivals and events, where he meets other like-minded creatives.
* Collecting rare books on art history, philosophy, and psychology, which fuel his imagination and inform his artistic vision.

As a result of Ana's mentorship, Marc María has become increasingly fascinated with the concept of "El Sueño" (The Dream), exploring its significance in his own life and work. He believes that art is a powerful tool for tapping into the collective unconscious, and strives to capture the essence of Barcelona's hidden stories and secrets on canvas.
