Borys's physical appearance reflects his artistic background. He has a slender build and an angular face, which gives him an air of intensity that complements his sharp intellect.

**Interests:** Borys is passionate about art history, particularly Impressionism. As an art critic, he has built a reputation for himself as one of the most insightful voices in the art world, and he takes great pride in his work.

He is drawn to beauty, connection, and the complexities of human experience. This is reflected in the way he responds to the stunning Monet watercolor, where his usual sharp tongue falters and he is overcome with emotion.
