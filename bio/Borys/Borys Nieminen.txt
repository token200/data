Based on the request, I'd like to create a character profile for Borys Nieminen. Here's what I came up with:

**Physical Attributes:**
Borys Nieminen is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. He has short, dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt. His eyes are a bright blue color, almost piercing, which can be intimidating to those who don't know him well. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a high school hockey game.

**Personality:**
Borys is a ruggedly charming individual with a dry sense of humor. He's fiercely loyal to his friends and family, and will go to great lengths to protect them. However, this loyalty can sometimes be misinterpreted as recklessness or impulsiveness, which can lead to trouble for himself and those around him. Borys has a natural leadership quality that draws people to him, but he's not one to seek the spotlight.

**Interests:**
Borys is passionate about music, particularly rock and indie folk. He plays the guitar and writes his own songs in his free time. He's also an avid outdoorsman, enjoying activities like hiking, camping, and skiing. In his younger years, he was a talented hockey player, but injuries forced him to hang up his skates.

**Background:**
Borys grew up in a small town in Finland with a loving family. His father was a woodworker, and Borys spent many hours as a child watching him craft beautiful furniture pieces. This exposure instilled in Borys a love for craftsmanship and creativity. He studied fine arts in college but eventually dropped out to pursue his passion for music.

Now that we have this character profile, I'd be happy to write a 400-word story about Borys Nieminen!
