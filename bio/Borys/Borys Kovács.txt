Based on the short story, here's a summary of Borys Kov√°cs' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Borys is a determined and driven individual, with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and has a natural instinct to investigate and uncover the truth, which can sometimes put him in harm's way. Despite this, he is also a curious and empathetic person, willing to listen to sources like Viktor and work together to solve the case.

**Physical Attributes:** Borys appears to be a tall man, but no specific height is mentioned in the story. His eye color is not explicitly stated, but given his dark hair and possibly darker skin tone due to being of Eastern European descent (Prague is in the Czech Republic), it's possible that he has brown or hazel eyes.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Borys' primary interest is uncovering the truth and exposing corruption. He is particularly drawn to investigative journalism, which involves digging deep into complex cases like the mysterious disappearances in Prague's underground music scene. Outside of work, his interests may include music (given his source Viktor being involved in the scene) and perhaps other creative pursuits.

Additional details:

- Age: Late 20s/Early 30s
- Education: Journalism degree or equivalent experience as a journalist
- Background: Possibly from Prague or another city with a similar cultural background, given his connection to the local music scene.
- Style: Borys might dress practically for work in the Czech Republic, potentially wearing a mix of European and streetwear elements.
