Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Borys Li:

**Physical Attributes:**
Borys Li is a tall and slender man, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm). His hair is dark brown and usually worn long, framing his angular face. His eyes are an intense shade of green, often described as piercing or unsettling by those who meet him for the first time. He has a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him a rugged yet intelligent appearance.

**Personality:**
Borys is a driven and introspective individual, fiercely dedicated to his work as an archaeologist. His passion for uncovering the secrets of ancient civilizations often leads him to neglect his personal life, causing him to appear aloof or isolated to those who don't know him. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be quick-witted when the situation calls for it. Borys is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging established theories and conventions in pursuit of the truth.

**Interests:**
Borys's fascination with ancient mysteries is rivaled only by his love of mythology and folklore. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure cultures and mythological creatures, which serves him well in his research. In addition to archaeology, he enjoys reading, particularly texts on esoteric subjects like alchemy and the occult.

**Other Traits:**
Borys is also intensely curious and loves solving puzzles, often to the point where it becomes an all-consuming obsession. He has a deep respect for the cultures he studies, which sometimes puts him at odds with his more commercial colleagues or treasure hunters who seek to exploit the ancient artifacts for personal gain.

As Borys delves deeper into the mystery of the statue, he begins to uncover evidence that suggests he is not just an archaeologist, but a guardian of ancient knowledge â€“ a concept that resonates deeply with him.
