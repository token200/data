Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Borys Abdi:

**Personality:** Borys Abdi is a driven and ambitious individual with a strong desire for success. He has a reputation as a master trader, which has earned him both admiration and envy from others. However, his focus on accumulating wealth and power has also made him wary and guarded, often causing him to come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

Despite this, Borys is not without empathy. His thoughts often turn to his family back in Baghdad, particularly his wife Fatima and their two young children, Ali and Leila. He wants the best for them, even if it means making sacrifices for himself.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue-green, a shade that seems almost otherworldly
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and styled in a neat braid down his back
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and a small nose, which gives him a slightly angular appearance
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and arms that speak to his years of manual labor as a trader.

**Interests:** Borys Abdi's primary interest is accumulating wealth and power through trade. He has an insatiable appetite for adventure, but only insofar as it serves him or enhances his business dealings. His curiosity about the mysterious spice known as the "Eye of the Beholder" drives much of his current endeavor.

Outside of trading and commerce, Borys's interests are largely practical and focused on his family. He enjoys spending time with Fatima and their children, playing games like chess, or simply enjoying a good cup of tea in the quiet evenings. However, even these pursuits seem to be tinged by his drive for success.

When not immersed in business or personal matters, Borys tends to indulge in literary works, often devouring histories, biographies, and philosophical texts that speak to trade and commerce.
