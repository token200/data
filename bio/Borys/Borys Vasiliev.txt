Here is a summary of Borys Vasiliev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Borys Vasiliev is a complex and enigmatic individual with a mysterious past. He has lived a life of high-stakes deception as a former spy, which has made him wary of getting close to others. Despite this, he possesses a quiet strength and kind heart that is revealed when he interacts with Sophia. As he opens up to her, his guard begins to drop, and we see glimpses of a more vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:** Borys stands at 6'1" (185 cm) tall with piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep intensity. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, adding to his rugged charm. He has a strong build from years of physical activity and carries himself with a quiet confidence.

**Interests:** As a former spy, Borys has developed a keen strategic mind and an expertise in languages. These skills have served him well in his past life, but he is eager to use them for more benign purposes now that he has retired from intelligence work. He enjoys reading, particularly history and literature, which sparked Sophia's initial interest in him.

Despite his rugged exterior, Borys has a soft spot for the arts and music, often listening to classical music when alone. His travels have also given him an appreciation for different cultures and cuisines, which he indulges in when exploring Ravenswood.
