Here's a summary of Stella Krumins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Stella is known for her quick wit and sharp tongue, which often serves as a defense mechanism to protect herself from the harsh realities of life. Despite this tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray cats and is compassionate towards others. She's also introverted and values her alone time, but when engaged with people or creative pursuits, she reveals a more vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:** Stella stands at around 5'6" (168 cm) with an athletic build, likely honed from years of working in the diner. Her hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often worn in a ponytail to keep it out of her face while she works. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green, which seem to gleam with intelligence when engaged. As mentioned earlier, Jack Harris noticed that Stella has piercing blue eyes, but this could be an exaggeration or a misconception.

**Interests:** Stella is passionate about writing poetry and music. She finds solace in creative expression, using her words to process the world around her and reflect on her own emotions. Her love for stray cats suggests that she's empathetic towards animals and may have a strong connection with nature. Working at the local diner also gives her a sense of community and purpose, allowing her to interact with people from all walks of life.

It's worth noting that while Stella is described as "known for her quick wit and sharp tongue," there isn't much information about her background or past experiences. This makes her character somewhat enigmatic, leaving room for interpretation and development in future stories.
