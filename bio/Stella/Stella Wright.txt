**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm, honey-brown eyes with golden flecks
* Hair: Wild, curly hair that falls down her back like a tumbleweed, often tied up in loose braids or ponytails.
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-smooth complexion with a subtle sprinkle of freckles across her nose and cheeks.

**Personality:**

Stella is a curious and imaginative individual with a passion for uncovering hidden stories and secrets. She's a free spirit, always drawn to the unknown and the unexplored. Her mischievous glint in the eye suggests a playful and adventurous nature, but also hints at a deeper sense of mystery and intrigue.

**Interests:**

Stella is an avid collector of rare books and forgotten tales. She spends most nights scouring local thrift stores and estate sales for unusual volumes, often returning to her cozy apartment to unravel their secrets. Her love of storytelling is deeply personal, and she feels a strong connection to the authors and stories that inspire her.

In addition to her love of literature, Stella has a passion for art and music. She's been known to sketch moonlit silhouettes on canvas, just like her grandmother used to do, and often finds herself lost in the melodies of old folk songs.

When she's not buried in dusty tomes or sketching by candlelight, Stella enjoys taking long walks under the winter stars, feeling the whispers of the wind carry secrets on their breath.
