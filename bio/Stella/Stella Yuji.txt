**Personality:** Stella is known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, which often leaves those around her in stitches. However, beneath this sassy exterior, she has a complex and sensitive soul that she only reveals to those closest to her. After facing a scandalous tabloid expose, Stella began to shed her superficial persona, revealing a more thoughtful and creative individual.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Dark brown with a hint of golden undertones
* Hair Color: Vibrant, curly black hair that often frames her face in loose waves

**Interests:** Stella's interests have evolved significantly since her days as a pop idol. She now finds joy in:

* Traditional Japanese arts:
 + Calligraphy
 + Tea ceremonies
 + Making traditional sweets (wagashi)
* Music and performance, but with a renewed sense of purpose and meaning
* Mentoring and sharing her love of art and performance with others who have found themselves lost in the spotlight

Stella's transformation has been nothing short of remarkable, as she trades in her glamorous persona for one that is authentic and deeply rooted in her artistic passions.
