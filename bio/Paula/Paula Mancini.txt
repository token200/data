**Personality:** Paula is a sharp-witted and quick-tongued individual who appears tough on the outside but has a heart of gold. She is confident and shrewd in her business dealings, but struggles with feelings of loneliness and a fear of vulnerability. Despite this, she is resilient and determined to pursue her goals.

**Physical Attributes:** Paula is likely a woman in her late 30s, though the exact age is not specified. Her height is not mentioned, but based on the context, it's possible that she is taller than average (around 5'8" or 172 cm). Her eye color is also not specified, but given her sparkling eyes at social events, it's likely that they are bright blue or green.

**Interests:** Paula appears to have a strong interest in her career as a businesswoman and negotiator. She is driven and ambitious, always looking for ways to improve her skills and advance in her profession. Outside of work, she values her relationships with friends and family, particularly her close friend Maria, who knows her well enough to offer support and advice.

Paula also seems to have an interest in personal growth and self-improvement, as evidenced by her willingness to consider taking on a new project at work that could lead to changes in her life. This suggests that she is open-minded and willing to challenge herself and explore new opportunities.

In terms of hobbies or leisure activities, there is no mention of Paula's interests outside of work or socializing with friends. However, based on the context, it seems likely that she enjoys spending time with others, perhaps including children (as Maria mentions being a "mom figure" to those who know her).
