She appears to be fiercely independent and non-conformist, as evident from her willingness to take risks in pursuit of the truth. Her job requires her to maintain a level of paranoia, which suggests that she is cautious and strategic in her approach. Despite this, she also seems driven by a sense of justice and a desire to expose corruption.

**Physical Attributes:**
Paula's physical attributes are not extensively described in the short story. However, based on the context, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Paula appears to be of average height, likely between 5'6" to 5'8". This would allow her to move easily through crowded spaces and blend into the background.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified, but given the Norwegian setting of Oslo, it's possible that she has blue or green eyes, which are common in Scandinavians.

**Interests:**
As a journalist, Paula's primary interest is in uncovering and reporting on corruption and wrongdoing. She appears to be particularly drawn to stories involving power struggles and high-stakes politics. Her job also allows her to interact with a wide range of people, from sources like her anonymous whistleblower to politicians and business leaders.

Outside of work, Paula may enjoy activities that allow her to explore the city of Oslo or connect with others who share her values. Given her introverted personality, she might prefer low-key social interactions or solo pursuits, such as reading, writing, or practicing yoga.
