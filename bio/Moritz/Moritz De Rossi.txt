He is intelligent, with eyes that seem to hold a world of knowledge, suggesting he has spent centuries studying art. His characteristically reserved nature suggests a level of caution and discernment, as seen in his choice to unveil the painting at an exclusive gala event rather than making it publicly available. This reserve also hints at a deeper understanding of the artwork's value.

* Eye Color: His eyes are described as having "a world of knowledge," suggesting they may be piercing blue or grey, possibly with a hint of warmth.

**Interests:** Moritz is clearly passionate about art, particularly the Impressionist movement. He has spent his life collecting rare and exquisite pieces from across the globe. This extensive knowledge and expertise in art likely stem from years of dedication to understanding the art world. The mention of a long-lost Monet painting suggests that Moritz values the historical significance and rarity of artworks.

Additionally, it can be inferred that Moritz is:

* Knowledgeable about various cultural contexts: His ability to understand the story behind "La Nuit Éternelle" and connect it to the village where he acquired the painting indicates a broad range of interests.

* Guarded and selective: His reserved nature during initial interactions and his guarded responses to questions suggest that Moritz may be a careful individual who chooses when to reveal information.

It is worth noting that the enigmatic stranger's character was not provided as extensively as Moritz' own attributes. However, based on her presence at the gala event and her conversation with Moritz about "La Nuit Éternelle," it appears she is likely:
