**Personality:** Moritz is an eccentric historian with a passion for uncovering the secrets of Poland's turbulent past. He is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the complexities of human experience. His obsession with Witold the Old has led him on a journey of discovery, not only about history but also about himself and those around him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Moritz stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender build, which allows him to navigate through dusty archives and cramped study spaces.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an unsettling shade of grey, reminiscent of old parchment and forgotten lore. They seem to hold a depth of wisdom, as if the secrets he's uncovered have left their mark on his soul.
* Hair: Moritz's hair is graying at the temples, framing his angular face with a wispy crown of silver locks. His unkempt hair adds to his eccentric appearance, making him look like a scholar who has been pouring over ancient texts for years.

His research takes him on a journey through dusty archives, crumbling libraries, and into the hearts of those who lived through turbulent times.

Moritz's interests extend beyond historical records, however. He is drawn to personal stories of loss and struggle, seeking to understand how individuals navigated the complexities of their time.
