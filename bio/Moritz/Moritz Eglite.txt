**Physical Attributes:** Moritz Eglite stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing blue eyes seem to see right through you, and his jet-black hair often falls across his forehead in a way that gives him a perpetually lost-in-thought appearance.

**Personality:** Moritz Eglite is an enigmatic and introspective person who keeps to himself due to a troubled past. He is fiercely independent and has built walls around himself to protect against the pain of past experiences.

As he opens up to Sophia, it becomes clear that Moritz Eglite is capable of great vulnerability and depth.

**Interests:** Moritz Eglite has a passion for working with his hands, particularly in the art of blacksmithing. He finds solace in the rhythmic motion of hammering hot metal into intricate designs and enjoys listening to the townspeople's gossip as he works. He also has a deep love for nature, often spending hours walking along the River Amper and finding peace in its gentle lapping against the shore.

**Additional Details:** It is hinted that Moritz Eglite has a traumatic past, which may have left him with physical scars as well as emotional ones. Despite this, he seems to be slowly rebuilding his life in Ravensburg, forming connections with the townspeople and finding love with Sophia.
