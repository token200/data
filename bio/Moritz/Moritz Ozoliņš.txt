Based on the short story provided, I will create a summary of Moritz Ozoliņš's personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Personality:**
Moritz Ozoliņš appears to be a skilled and resourceful individual. He is able to think on his feet and adapt quickly to new situations, as evidenced by his ability to switch between multiple disguises during the gala event. He also seems to have a strong sense of determination and focus, as he is willing to take on high-stakes missions for his clients.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a sleek, sophisticated manner

It's not specified how Moritz got these physical attributes, so I will just make an educated guess that they are a result of his "natural" good looks. 

**Interests:** 
Given his line of work as a freelance agent and master of disguise, it is likely that Moritz has a strong interest in:

* Spy craft and espionage
* Disguise and deception techniques
* Surveillance and surveillance techniques
* Networking and building relationships with influential individuals

Additionally, his willingness to attend exclusive events like the gala suggests that he may have an appreciation for luxury and high society. However, this could also be part of his work as a spy.

It's worth noting that these are just inferences based on the provided story and not necessarily definitive characteristics of Moritz Ozoliņš. If you would like to continue with the character or start a new story, I'd be happy to help!
