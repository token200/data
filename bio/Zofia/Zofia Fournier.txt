Here's a summary of the fictional character Zofia Fournier:

**Physical Attributes:** Zofia is a young woman with a slender yet athletic build. She stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) tall, with long, curly brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an expressive shade of green, almost like emeralds, which sparkle with creativity and imagination.

**Personality:** Zofia is a creative soul with a deep passion for art. She is fiercely independent and values her alone time, often spending hours lost in her own world surrounded by canvases and paints. Despite her bold exterior, she struggles with self-doubt and fear of failure, which can make her withdrawn and uncertain at times. However, when she opens up to people like Max, she reveals a kind and compassionate heart that is eager to learn and grow.

**Interests:** Zofia's primary interests revolve around art, creativity, and self-expression. She loves nothing more than experimenting with different mediums, techniques, and styles to bring her ideas to life. Her other passions include music (she plays the guitar and sings softly), nature (she finds solace in walking through the rolling hills of Ashwood), and writing (she keeps a journal to express her thoughts and emotions).

**Additional Quirks:** Zofia has a habit of talking to herself when she's painting, often using colorful metaphors and analogies to describe her artistic vision. She is also known for being fiercely protective of her creative space, which can sometimes make it difficult for others to enter or collaborate with her.

Overall, Zofia Fournier is a complex and multi-faceted character with a rich inner life and a passion for art that drives her to create something truly beautiful and meaningful.
