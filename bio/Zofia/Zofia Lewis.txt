Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Zofia Lewis:

**Personality:** Zofia Lewis is a complex individual with a sharp wit and quick tongue. She appears confident and successful on the surface, but beneath this exterior lies a guarded nature that has helped her navigate the cutthroat world of finance. Despite her accomplishments, she struggles to connect with others on a deeper level, having built walls around herself to protect against vulnerability. However, when she meets Alex, she begins to open up and become more vulnerable, revealing her true self.

**Physical Attributes:** Zofia Lewis is in her late twenties, likely mid-to-late twenty-something. She is of average height, standing at around 5'6" (168 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is dark brown and styled neatly, often falling just below her shoulders. Her eyes are an expressive shade of hazel, often flashing with wit or emotion.

**Interests:** Zofia Lewis appears to be interested in the business world, having built a successful career as an investor and negotiator. She also enjoys exploring her personal interests and passions outside of work, including trying new restaurants and visiting museums. Her love for storytelling is evident, as she opens up to Alex about her family and past, revealing scars that she had kept hidden.

It's worth noting that there are a few details in the original short story that I didn't include here - Zofia's age, height, and eye color were not specified.
