Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Eike Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost indigo in shade, due to his Eastern European ancestry
- Hair Color: Dark brown to black, falling across his forehead like a curtain of night as described in the story.
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at.

**Personality:**
Eike Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus is a complex character with a mix of traits. He seems driven by a sense of duty and loyalty to his father, the Roman Emperor Diocletian. However, there's also a hint of skepticism and curiosity about the world around him. He appears willing to question his father's views but does so in a way that respects his authority.

As he delves deeper into the cults that seek to supplant Roman dominance, Eike becomes increasingly determined to understand their tactics and weaknesses. This could suggest a strategic thinker who enjoys studying the competition and finding ways to outmaneuver them.

Despite being around influential figures like Aurelian, Eike's thoughts often wander towards the "streets below," indicating a connection with ordinary people and perhaps a desire for change from within.

**Interests:**
- Studying Cults and Tactics: As mentioned in the story, Eike becomes intensely interested in understanding the cults that threaten Roman dominance. This interest could stem from a strategic mindset or an innate curiosity about power dynamics.
- Politics and Power: Given his connection to Diocletian and the fact that he's considered for succession, it's clear that Eike has interests in politics and power. He's learning everything he can about how empires rise and fall like tides, which could be a sign of a deep understanding of historical patterns or a desire to repeat successes from the past.
- Empowerment of Common People: By focusing on his interactions with ordinary people (the "streets below"), Eike seems to value their concerns and aspirations. This might indicate an interest in grassroots movements, revolution, or simply empowering those marginalized by power structures.

Overall, Eike Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus appears to be a multifaceted character with both strategic and emotional dimensions.
