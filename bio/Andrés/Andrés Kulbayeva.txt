**Personality:** Andrés Kulbayeva, also known as "El Fantasma," is a charismatic and cunning master thief. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to any situation.

He has a deep understanding of human emotions and behavior, allowing him to manipulate people to get what he wants.

**Physical Attributes:** Andrés is tall and lean, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). His eye color is an uncommon shade of green, almost like emeralds. He often wears dark hair dye to cover his natural brown locks, giving himself a chameleon-like appearance that allows him to blend into the crowd.

**Interests:** Andrés has a deep love for performance and theater, viewing his thieving activities as a form of art. He is fascinated by the world of illusions and misdirection, often incorporating magic tricks and sleight-of-hand techniques into his heists.

Additionally, Andrés has a strong interest in history and culture, often targeting artifacts and relics from significant periods or civilizations. He is also drawn to the world of espionage and counter-intelligence, recognizing the parallels between these fields and his own line of work.

It's worth noting that while Andrés' admiration for Sofia Moreno, the forensic psychologist, suggests a certain level of respect for her intellect and artistry, he remains ultimately driven by his own ambition and desire for notoriety.
