Despite his struggles in life, he has developed a resilience and adaptability that allows him to thrive in uncertain environments. As an artist, he is introspective and emotive, able to tap into the feelings of those around him. However, this same sensitivity can make him feel like an outsider, as if he doesn't quite fit in with either his own identity or the world at large. Andrés has a strong sense of longing for authenticity and freedom, driving him to pursue his artistic aspirations and challenge the status quo.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of living on the streets

**Interests:** Andrés is a creative soul with a passion for art, music, and self-expression. He finds solace in the freedom to create without boundaries or constraints. As a street artist, he is drawn to the raw energy of urban environments and the people who inhabit them. He is fascinated by the stories and struggles of those living on the margins, and his art often reflects this empathy and understanding.

Despite his love of art, Andrés has a curious mind and enjoys learning about history, philosophy, and psychology. He is particularly drawn to the works of existentialists like Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas resonate with his own struggles for identity and authenticity.
