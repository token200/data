Here's a summary of Andrés Nowakowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Andrés is a complex and introspective individual with an air of quiet intensity. He has a deep sadness and emotional scars from his past experiences as an artist, which have made him reclusive and withdrawn. Despite this, he possesses a spark of hope and vulnerability that makes him relatable and sympathetic.

As a former artist, Andrés is fiercely creative and passionate about his work, but he's also been consumed by self-doubt and criticism. This has led to a sense of disconnection from the world around him. However, when he encounters someone who understands and resonates with him, he opens up and reveals a more sensitive side.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Andrés stands at about 5'10" (178 cm), with a lean and wiry build that belies his emotional depth.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an intense shade of brown, almost black, which seems to absorb the light around him. They hold a deep sadness and a hint of warmth, which is often hard to read.
* Face: Andrés's face is rugged and weathered, with sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline that suggests a quiet strength. His weary expression is tempered by a subtle smile, which hints at the depth of his emotions.

**Interests:** As an artist, Andrés has always been drawn to capturing the beauty and essence of the world around him. He's passionate about landscapes, nature, and the human experience. In his former life as an artist, he would often pour his heart and soul into his work, experimenting with bold strokes, vibrant colors, and textures.

Although he's now a recluse, Andrés still finds solace in art and creativity. When cataloging books at the library, he often gets lost in the stories and histories hidden within the pages. His love for literature is almost palpable, and he's particularly drawn to works of mysticism, philosophy, and poetry.

In his interactions with others, Andrés is introspective and reserved, preferring to listen rather than speak. However, when someone understands him on a deep level, he becomes more open and expressive, revealing a rich inner world that's both beautiful and haunting.
