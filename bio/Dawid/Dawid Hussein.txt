Based on the short story, here is a summary of Dawid Hussein's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Dawid Hussein is a brave, ambitious, and dedicated individual who values truth and transparency above all else. He is a natural-born questioner with an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. His parents' influence as high school teachers instilled in him a strong sense of questioning and critical thinking, which serves him well in his journalistic career.

Physical Attributes:
* Height: Dawid stands at 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he interviews or writes about.
* Hair Color: He has dark brown hair that is often tousled and unkempt, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance.
* Build: Dawid has a lean build, typical of someone who spends most of their time typing away on their computer rather than engaging in physical activity.

Interests:
Dawid's interests are centered around investigative journalism and uncovering the truth. He is fascinated by politics, social issues, and corruption, and he dedicates much of his free time to researching and reading about these topics. When not working, Dawid enjoys long walks, listening to classical music, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.

It's worth noting that while Dawid Hussein is a fictional character, I tried to create an accurate representation based on the short story provided. The physical attributes and interests are all made-up details, but they seem to fit with the personality traits of someone who is brave, curious, and dedicated to uncovering the truth.
