Here is a summary of the fictional character Dawid Korhonen:

Dawid Korhonen is a writer in his mid-30s, with an intense and brooding personality. He has a lean build and stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with dark hair that often falls across his forehead. His eyes are an unsettling shade of piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets.

Physically, Dawid's features are sharp and angular, giving him an almost spectral appearance. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident. His skin is pale, with a subtle sheen that hints at his reclusive lifestyle.

Dawid's interests revolve around the darker corners of history and folklore, particularly those involving ancient tribes and mysterious artifacts like mirrors. He spends most of his time holed up in his dimly lit room, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles, as seen in the short story. This eerie atmosphere seems to fuel his creativity and inspire his writing.

Despite his introverted nature, Dawid has a deep fascination with the supernatural and the occult, which he explores through his research and writing. He is drawn to the darker aspects of human nature and the unknown, often blurring the lines between reality and fiction in his stories.

Dawid's passion for his craft is evident in his dedication to his work, but it also comes at a personal cost. His obsession with the mirror and its dark history has left him questioning the very fabric of reality, and he begins to suspect that his story may have unleashed a malevolent force into the world.
