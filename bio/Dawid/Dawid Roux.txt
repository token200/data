**Personality:** Dawid Roux is a complex and enigmatic individual with a troubled past. He appears to be introverted and guarded, preferring to keep his distance from others due to the weight of his secrets. However, he also seems to have a deep longing for connection and a sense of normalcy, which is at odds with his current state as a shadowy figure. Dawid's personality is likely shaped by his experiences in the city, where he was involved in some kind of illicit or underground activity ( hinted at by the whispers and rumors surrounding him). He may be fiercely independent and self-reliant, having learned to rely only on himself for survival.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** Dawid is likely of average height, possibly around 5'9"-6'1" (175-185 cm), as there is no specific mention of his height.
* **Eye Color:** His eye color is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, based on the contrast between his gaze and the warm smile of the woman with crinkled eyes, it's possible that Dawid has darker or more intense eyes, such as brown or green.

**Interests:**

Dawid's interests seem to be rooted in the past and his experiences in the city. He likely still values simplicity, warmth, and connection, but these are now tainted by his knowledge of the world's darker corners. His return to this small town suggests that he may be seeking a simpler life or a chance to escape his past. Dawid may also be fascinated by the ordinary aspects of life, observing the little things with an air of detachment that serves as a coping mechanism for his troubled past.
