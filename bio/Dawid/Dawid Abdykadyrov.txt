Despite his rugged features and piercing blue eyes, he seems to have a deep sense of kindness and empathy, as evidenced by his interactions with the local youngsters at the park.

However, Dawid also seems to be guarded, always on high alert for potential threats, which suggests that he may still carry some emotional scars from his past as a spy. He is cautious in his demeanor and interactions, making it difficult for people to read him or get close to him.

**Interests:** Dawid's interests appear to be centered around his quiet life in Ashwood. He seems to enjoy spending time with children and playing catch at the local park, which suggests that he values simplicity and community.

In addition, it is hinted that Dawid may still have a connection to his past as a spy, as evidenced by the small, intricately carved wooden box on his dresser adorned with symbols from an unknown language. This box may hold secrets or reminders of his past life, suggesting that Dawid's interests may also include collecting or studying rare and mysterious artifacts.

Overall, Dawid seems to be a man of contradictions: tough exterior, soft center; guardedly introspective, yet deeply empathetic; and haunted by his past, yet finding solace in the quiet comforts of Ashwood.
