**Interests:** Dawid's primary interest is physics, particularly quantum mechanics and the mysteries of black holes. He spends most of his free time reading scientific papers, attending conferences, or conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory. However, as he grapples with his personal life, he begins to explore other passions, such as literature (especially Polish writers like Witold Gombrowicz) and art. Dawid finds solace in the beauty of nature, often taking long walks through Krakow's parks and gardens to clear his mind.

In summary, Dawid Wagner is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a strong sense of purpose, but also a growing awareness of the importance of balance in life.
