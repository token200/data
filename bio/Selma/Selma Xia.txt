Her eyes are large and expressive, sparkling like polished obsidian when she's absorbed in a reading or connected to her clients. Her height is not explicitly stated, but based on the description of her moving "through her space" with an aura of quiet confidence, it can be inferred that she is likely on the shorter side.

In addition to these specific interests, Selma appears to have a broader passion for exploring the realms of past, present, and future, with a desire to become an ambassador between these different planes of existence. This suggests that she is drawn to concepts like interdimensionality, cosmic alignment, or other forms of spiritual exploration.
