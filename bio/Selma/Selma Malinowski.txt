**Background:**

While not explicitly stated in the text, we can infer that Selma Malinowski has a troubled past. Her enigmatic nature and preference for solitude suggest that she may be hiding from something or someone. Perhaps she left behind everything familiar to escape a painful experience or to start anew? Whatever her reasons, it's clear that Selma is driven by an unyielding resolve forged from the fire of her own resilience.

In terms of specific details about her past, I would venture to say that Selma was born and raised in a different part of the country or even abroad. She may have experienced some kind of trauma or loss that led her to leave behind everything familiar and start over in Willow Creek. However, these details are purely speculative, and only she truly knows the truth about her enigmatic life.
