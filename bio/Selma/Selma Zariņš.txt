Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Selma Zariņš:

**Personality:** Selma is known for being humble and dedicated to her craft. Despite her growing success and reputation, she remains focused on perfecting her art and continues to work tirelessly in her small workshop. Her quiet confidence and passion for woodcarving are evident in her work, and she has a way of making people feel at ease when they interact with her.

**Physical Attributes:** Selma is described as having an uncanny ability to bring life to the most mundane objects, but there is no specific information about her physical appearance. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that she is likely in her mid-to-late adulthood, given her years of experience and success as a woodcarver. If we were to imagine a height for Selma, let's say she stands around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.

As for eye color, since the story doesn't explicitly mention it, I would describe her eyes as being warm and expressive, with a hint of brown or hazel that seems to sparkle with creativity. The author mentions that her eyes "sparkled with a hint of the magic that lay within the wood itself," suggesting that they are an important part of her personality.

**Interests:** Selma's primary interest is woodworking, specifically woodcarving. She is deeply passionate about her craft and spends countless hours honing her skills and pushing herself to create new and innovative pieces. Her love for wood is not just about technical proficiency but also about the connection she feels with the natural world and the stories that can be told through the wood itself.

Beyond woodworking, Selma seems to have a deep appreciation for Latvian folk art and culture, which inspires her work. She also values quiet, peaceful environments, often finding solace in the stillness of her small workshop surrounded by the scent of wood and the hum of saws.
