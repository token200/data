* Hair Color: Rich, dark brown with hints of chestnut undertones
* Build: Slender, yet athletic, suggesting a lifestyle that prioritizes mental and physical well-being.
* Skin Tone: Smooth, creamy complexion with a subtle warmth to her cheeks.

**Interests:**

* Writing (poetry, stories, and novels)
* Music (though she deems her singing voice unremarkable, she may have an appreciation for other forms of music)
* Art (she had tried her hand at it but didn't feel a strong connection)
* Nature (specifically, the family vineyard where she spent her childhood)
