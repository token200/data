Here is a summary of Selma Yuji's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Selma is a curious and open-minded individual who sees the world from different perspectives. She has a passion for photography that goes beyond just capturing everyday life; she wants to reveal the beauty in the mundane and tell stories about the people and cultures that often go unseen. Her encounter with Taro at Kintsugi sparks a new way of looking at the world, encouraging her to see broken things as beautiful.

**Physical Attributes:** Selma is 25 years old, but unfortunately, there are no other details provided in the text about her physical appearance. 

However, considering she lives in Tokyo and enjoys street photography like an urban explorer, I'd imagine that Selma might have a lean build with short to medium-length dark hair and expressive eyes.

**Interests:** As a freelance photographer, Selma is passionate about capturing the beauty of everyday life, street photography, and telling stories through her lens. She has a keen eye for detail and is drawn to exploring hidden corners of the city. Her encounter with Taro at Kintsugi introduces her to the concept of "Kintsugi" - the art of repairing broken pottery with gold or silver lacquer, highlighting the brokenness rather than disguising it. This inspires her to see beauty in imperfections and encourages her to experiment with new techniques to showcase these unique qualities.

After visiting Taro's shop regularly for a week, Selma develops a deeper appreciation for photography as an art form that can reveal the beauty in broken things. She continues to explore Tokyo's hidden corners, seeking out unique stories and perspectives through her camera lens.
