Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Selma Straume:

**Physical Attributes:** Selma stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, which reflects her active lifestyle and love for nature. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a piercing blue, reminiscent of the Norwegian fjords she loves to capture through her lens.

**Personality:** Selma is a determined and driven individual, with an unyielding passion for uncovering the truth about her family's past. She is fiercely independent and resourceful, having grown up in a remote community where she had to rely on herself from a young age. Despite her tough exterior, Selma has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Selma's primary interest lies in capturing the beauty of Norway's landscapes and people. She is also deeply curious about history and genealogy, having inherited a love for storytelling from her mother. Her search for her great-grandfather's diary has reignited a sense of adventure and purpose within her.

**Additional Traits:** Selma's Norwegian heritage is evident in her reserved nature and strong connection to the land. She speaks fluent Norwegian with a hint of dialect, passed down from her family. Her love for the sea and its mysteries has instilled a sense of awe and reverence within her, which she hopes to share through her photography.

**Age:** Selma's age is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on the context, it can be inferred that she is likely in her mid-to-late twenties or early thirties, having already established herself as a photographer before embarking on this personal journey of discovery.
