Here's a summary of the fictional character Selma Piatek:

**Physical Attributes:** Selma is described as a master of disguise and deception, but no specific physical attributes are mentioned. However, based on her skills and profession, it can be inferred that she likely has a slender yet athletic build, allowing her to move stealthily and with ease in various settings.

Given the European setting of her adventures (Paris, Rome, Tuscany), Selma's eye color could be blue or green, typical of many Europeans. For height, let's assume she stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which would allow her to blend in and navigate museum galleries with ease.

She seems to be driven by a passion for art and history, using her talents to outwit even the most skilled detectives. Her confidence and determination are evident, as she takes risks that others would shy away from.

However, we also see glimpses of her human side: she can't resist taking on a challenge, and the thrill of the heist is too great for her to resist. This sense of excitement and playfulness suggests that Selma has a strong sense of curiosity and a love for puzzle-solving.

**Interests:** As an art thief, Selma's interests are likely focused on art history, museums, and cultural heritage. She has a deep understanding of various artistic movements and styles, which helps her identify valuable pieces to steal. Her passion for art and history drives her to track down rare and priceless works, making her one of the most sought-after thieves in the world.

Her interests may also include cryptography, codes, and puzzle-solving, given the cryptic clues she leaves behind for her pursuers. These skills allow her to stay one step ahead of those trying to catch her, cementing her reputation as a master thief.

Overall, Selma Piatek is a complex character with a unique blend of artistic expertise, intellectual curiosity, and daring spirit.
