Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Selma Wróbel:

**Physical Attributes:**
Selma is a slender woman with an unassuming presence. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, which allows her to move easily between her workshop's various areas. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a world of wisdom and kindness. She has a small nose and a gentle smile that puts those around her at ease.

**Personality:**
Selma is a compassionate and introspective person who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is deeply empathetic and can often be seen lost in thought, trying to understand the complexities of human emotions. Her talent for weaving has granted her a unique perspective on life, allowing her to tap into the collective unconscious and channel it into her art. Despite her fame, Selma remains humble and kind, always willing to share her knowledge with others.

**Interests:**
Selma is passionate about weaving, naturally, but she also has a deep love for nature and the stories that surround it. She draws inspiration from mythology, folklore, and personal experiences, often incorporating themes of love, loss, and transformation into her tapestries. In addition to her artistic pursuits, Selma enjoys spending time in the forest, gathering natural dyes and studying the patterns of the earth.

As an adult, she remains deeply connected to her roots and community, using her success to support local artisans and preserve traditional crafts. She is also a keen listener and teacher, always eager to share her knowledge with others who possess a similar spark within them.

Selma's personal life is filled with creative pursuits and quiet moments of introspection. When she's not working on her latest tapestry or sharing stories with Kasia, you can find her lost in the pages of an old book or listening to the sounds of nature – whatever brings her closer to understanding the intricate web of human emotions that drive her art.
