Based on the short story, I can create a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Selma Corberó:

**Personality:** Selma is depicted as a passionate and talented individual who pours her heart and soul into traditional Catalan dance. She is driven by her love for her craft and is willing to take risks to pursue her dreams. Her fierce determination and dedication are qualities that make her stand out, and she is not afraid to show her emotions through her movements.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm) - a petite but athletic build allows Selma to move with agility and precision.
* Eye Color: Hazel - a warm and expressive eye color that seems to sparkle with excitement when Selma is dancing.
* Hair: Dark Brown, Long and Wavy - her hair is often tied back in a loose bun, revealing her expressive face.
* Skin Tone: Olive - a natural glow that gives Selma a radiant complexion.

**Interests:** Selma's primary interest is traditional Catalan dance, which she has been trained in by her abuela since childhood. She also values her relationship with her family, particularly her mother and abuela, who have supported her throughout her journey. In addition to dance, Selma enjoys the vibrant culture of Catalonia and is deeply connected to its history and traditions.
