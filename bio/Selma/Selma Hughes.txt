Outside of science, Selma seems to have a deep appreciation for solitude and independence. She enjoys spending time alone in her secluded cabin, surrounded by lush greenery and exotic wildlife, where she can focus on her work without distraction. Despite this preference for isolation, there's an unmistakable sense that Selma values human connection, which is why she invites Sarah into her home for their conversation â€“ and why she ultimately decides to trust the young journalist.
