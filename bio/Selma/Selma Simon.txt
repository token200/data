She has dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a piercing green, a color that seems to gleam with intensity when she's on the hunt for a story. Her skin is tanned from spending countless hours outdoors, giving her a weathered yet radiant complexion.

She has an unyielding commitment to truth and will stop at nothing to expose those in power who seek to deceive or manipulate the public.

Despite her tough exterior, Selma has a deep sense of empathy and compassion for those affected by corruption and injustice.

**Interests:**

She's an avid researcher and interviewer, with a keen ear for detail and a talent for piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments of information. In her free time, Selma enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, sampling local cuisine, and sipping coffee at cramped, smoke-filled diners like the one where she received that fateful phone call.

Overall, Selma Simon is a complex, multi-dimensional character with a fierce determination to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged. Her reputation as a fearless and unyielding journalist has earned her both respect and admiration from her peers, while also inspiring fear and intimidation in those she's taken on - particularly Marcus Reed.
