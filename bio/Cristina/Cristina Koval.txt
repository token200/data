Based on the short story, here is a summary of Cristina Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Cristina appears to be a determined and ambitious individual. As a freelance journalist, she has seen it all and is not easily intimidated by corrupt officials or power struggles. She is driven by her desire for truth and justice, as evident in her willingness to take on the high-ranking government official embezzling funds. Her courage and tenacity are admirable, but also hint at a sense of vulnerability, as she becomes increasingly paranoid about being watched after sending out her expos√©.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Cristina's height is not explicitly stated, but based on the context of navigating Tokyo's streets and meeting with Tanaka in a coffee shop, it can be inferred that she is likely around 5'6" to 5'8".
* Eye Color: The story does not provide information about Cristina's eye color, so we will have to make an educated guess. Given her East Asian background (implied by the setting of Tokyo), she might have dark brown or green eyes.
* Other Physical Attributes: Unfortunately, there is no detailed description of Cristina's physical appearance beyond her height and eye color.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Cristina is clearly passionate about uncovering truth and exposing corruption. Her work takes her to various parts of the city, from high-rise offices to small cafes like Tanaka's coffee shop. She seems to be drawn to stories that have significant social implications and is willing to take risks to get them out.

In terms of interests beyond journalism, it is unclear what Cristina enjoys doing in her free time. However, based on her dedication to her work and her tenacity, it can be inferred that she values independence, self-reliance, and intellectual pursuits.
