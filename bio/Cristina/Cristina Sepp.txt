**Physical Attributes:** Cristina stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail when she works. Her eyes are a striking shade of emerald green, a trait inherited from her Italian heritage. She has a small tattoo of a painter's palette on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Cristina is a driven and passionate individual with an unwavering commitment to her art. Despite her success, she remains humble and down-to-earth, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement to fellow artists. She has a quick wit and a sharp sense of humor, often cracking jokes to ease tension in high-pressure situations. Cristina is fiercely independent and values her alone time, but when surrounded by like-minded individuals, she becomes warm and generous.

**Interests:** Christina's artistic endeavors take up most of her waking hours, as she experiments with various mediums, techniques, and styles. She has a particular affinity for sculpture, often incorporating found objects and natural materials into her work.

She is also an avid traveler, having spent time in Paris and Italy as part of her artistic education, and has a strong interest in social justice causes.
