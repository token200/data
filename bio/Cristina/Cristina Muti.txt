Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Cristina Muti's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Cristina appears to be a passionate and emotive person, as evident from her intense performances on stage. She is also deeply introspective and curious about the world around her, as hinted at by her fascination with books and storytelling. Her secret and the mysterious visions she experiences suggest that there may be more to her personality than meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the provided text does not give us much information about Cristina's physical attributes. However, based on the story, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Given that Cristina is a lead soprano of an opera house, it's likely that she has a slender yet strong build. Let's assume her height is around 5'7" (170 cm).
* Eye Color: The text mentions piercing green eyes when describing the elderly woman who approaches Cristina after the opera. Since Cristina's own eye color is not mentioned, I'll assume hers are brown or hazel, similar to many people of Mediterranean descent.

**Interests:** Cristina's love for music and storytelling is evident throughout the story. She was trained by her mother in singing from a young age and has a deep appreciation for the art form. Her interests extend beyond music, as she devours books on literature and history, including works by Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio. This suggests that Cristina values knowledge, creativity, and self-expression.

Additionally, Cristina's experiences with the mysterious visions suggest that she may have an interest in the spiritual or mystical aspects of life, which could be a key aspect of her personality as she navigates this new chapter in her life.
