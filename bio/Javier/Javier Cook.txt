**Personality:** Javier appears to be introspective, nostalgic, and possibly struggling with self-doubt. He has been away from his hometown and high school sweetheart for five years, chasing dreams that didn't work out. However, when he returns, he is motivated by a desire to reconnect with his past and find his place in the world again. Javier seems to be haunted by regrets and is hesitant at first, but as he starts playing music again, he begins to feel more alive and confident.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair: Dark brown, possibly still with a hint of messiness from his past life

**Interests:** Music is clearly Javier's passion. He was always chasing dreams related to music, but fear and doubt held him back. Upon returning home, he starts playing again, which sparks something within him. His interest in music is now more than just a hobby â€“ it's an escape, a way to express himself, and potentially a path to finding his sense of belonging.

It's also worth noting that Javier has an interest in connecting with his past and reconnecting with the people who matter most to him, like Emma, his high school sweetheart.
