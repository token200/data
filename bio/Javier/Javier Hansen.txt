**Physical Attributes:** Javier stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a piercing brown that seem to see right through to the soul. He has short, dark hair that's often messy and unkempt, giving him a rough-around-the-edges look that's perfect for his urban jungle lifestyle.

**Personality:** Javier is a complex individual with a rugged exterior and a heart of gold. Growing up on the tough side of town, he learned early on to rely only on himself and trust no one. However, this tough exterior hides a deep sense of empathy and compassion for those who have been marginalized or silenced. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, always seeking to challenge the status quo and speak truth to power.
