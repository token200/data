Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Javier Olsson:

**Physical Attributes:**
Javier is a Swedish painter in his mid-to-late 30s. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic yet slender build, often hidden beneath layers of worn jeans and threadbare shirts that have seen their fair share of studio sessions. His eyes are piercing green, a trait inherited from his Swedish heritage, which seem to gleam with an intensity that borders on obsession as he works tirelessly on his art.

**Personality:**
Javier is a complex and introspective individual, driven by a fierce passion for his craft. He has a dark and moody side, drawn to the shadows of human nature and the macabre aspects of life. Despite this fascination with the darker corners of existence, Javier has a dry sense of humor and can be quite witty when he wants to be. His artistic intensity sometimes gives way to a deep-seated anxiety and depression, which he struggles to keep at bay.

**Interests:**
Javier's interests are deeply intertwined with his art. He is fascinated by surrealism and realism, often blending elements of both styles to create hauntingly lifelike portraits of the damned. As a child, Javier was enthralled by Gustav Dor√©'s works, which inspired his own unique style. When not in his studio, Javier can be found sipping cheap wine and engaging in lively conversations with fellow artists or simply lost in thought, contemplating the human condition.

**Additional Traits:**
Javier is fiercely individualistic and non-conformist, often finding himself at odds with the establishment. Despite this, he has a deep-seated desire to connect with others through his art, which becomes a source of solace for him when struggling with anxiety and depression. He is also intensely private and prefers to keep his personal life separate from his artistic pursuits.
