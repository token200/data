Dagmar exudes an air of unyielding intensity that commands attention and inspires respect from those who know her. However, she is also fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Interests:**
Dagmar has a deep love for words and storytelling, which was sparked by listening to her Finnish grandmother's tales of myth and legend as a child.
