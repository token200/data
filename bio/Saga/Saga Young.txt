Her confidence and expertise have earned her both fear and respect from her peers, but she also has a vulnerable side, as hinted at when she feels a spark of attraction towards Kaito. Saga is fiercely loyal to those she cares about, particularly Kaito, with whom she shares a deep bond formed through childhood friendships.

**Physical Attributes:** Saga stands at an average height of 5'8" (173 cm), which is consistent with the description of her standing alongside Kaito on the rooftop. Her eye color is brown, as opposed to green, which was described as belonging to her friend Kaito. There are no further details about her physical appearance beyond this.

She is also deeply invested in the mission to take down the corrupt government officials controlling the city's infrastructure, driven by a sense of purpose and determination. Her love for her friend Kaito adds another layer to her interests, as their bond strengthens as they work together on the resistance.

These details paint a picture of Saga Young as a complex, multi-faceted character with a strong sense of justice and a fierce dedication to those she cares about.
