She is also portrayed as having an extraordinary gift for painting, which suggests that she has a strong creative drive and passion for her craft. Her dedication to her art is admirable, and she is willing to put in the time and effort required to perfect her skills.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Saga Li is not mentioned by height, so I will assume an average height of 5'6" (168 cm) based on traditional Chinese artistic depictions.
