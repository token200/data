Based on the short story about Spanish actress Saga Corberó, here is a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Saga appears to be a introspective and creative person who values her independence. She has a strong sense of self and is comfortable with navigating the pressures of fame while also pursuing her own passions. She seems to be someone who finds solace in nature and quiet reflection, using these moments to recharge and focus on her artistic endeavors.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on Saga Corberó's physical attributes, so I'll make some educated guesses based on the actress she is (not a fictional character). Saga Corberó is a Spanish actress who stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall. Her eye color is brown, and her hair is likely dark brown or black, typical of many Spanish women.

**Interests:** Based on her roles in films like "Verónica" and "La Llorona", it appears that Saga Corberó is drawn to complex and thought-provoking storylines that explore themes of trauma, identity, and the human condition. She may also be interested in exploring different genres and styles of filmmaking, and perhaps even venturing into directing or producing roles behind the camera.

Please note that these are just fictional interpretations based on the actress Saga Corberó and not specific to a fictional character named Saga Corberó.
