Based on the short story, here is a summary of Kārlis Szymański's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Karli is an enigmatic figure known for being quiet yet fiercely loyal. He has a mysterious nature that draws people in, but also keeps them at bay. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side and a strong sense of justice, which drives him to protect those in need. His experience with violence and bloodshed has left emotional scars, but he is determined to make amends and create positive change.

**Physical Attributes:**

Unfortunately, there is no mention of Karli's physical attributes in the short story. However, based on his background and personality, I have made some educated guesses.

**Interests:** Karli has a strong interest in social justice and unyielding spirits, which inspired him to leave his life of crime and start teaching underprivileged youth combat techniques. He is passionate about teamwork, unity, and defending those who cannot defend themselves. His interests also seem to align with Mārtiņš' passion for art and understanding the darker aspects of Latvian history.

Overall, Karli Szymański appears to be a complex individual driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to create positive change in his community.
