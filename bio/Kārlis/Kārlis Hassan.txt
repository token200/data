He has a wistful sense of nostalgia, often looking back on childhood memories and past experiences that have shaped his artistic perspective. Despite this, he is also drawn to new experiences and ideas, as seen in his decision to seek inspiration in a small coastal town.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Kārlis stands at around 6'0" (183 cm), allowing him to gaze out at the horizon with ease.
* Eye Color: His eyes are dark brown, reflecting his Latvian heritage and hinting at the rich cultural influences in his life.
* Hair: His hair is dark and unruly, whipping through it as he stands on the beach. It's a wild tangle of curls that often frames his face.

**Interests:** Kārlis is deeply interested in art, particularly sculpture. He draws inspiration from nature and the intricate patterns found in Eastern cultures, such as those seen in ancient Babylonian hieroglyphs. He is also drawn to stories, folk tales, and myths, which are often linked to his father's immigration from Iraq.

As Kārlis navigates this new place, he finds himself interested in exploring its history, culture, and natural beauty. He is particularly drawn to the local folklore, including stories about sea monsters and cursed ships that weave together elements of mythology with his own artistic experiences.
