Based on the short story, here is a summary of Zoltan Girard's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zoltan Girard is a man of quiet confidence and introspection. He exudes an air of mystery, which commands attention without demanding it. Despite his success as a renowned detective, he appears unassuming and approachable, particularly when interacting with people in need. His calm demeanor belies a sharp mind and intense focus on solving the case at hand.

**Physical Attributes:** Zoltan stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, giving him an imposing presence. His eye color is a deep, piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often impeccably styled, framing his chiseled features and angular face. He has a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones, which lend to his determined and intelligent expression.

**Interests:** Zoltan's interests lie in solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. As a detective, he finds fascination in the art of deduction and the psychology of human behavior. Outside of work, it is likely that he enjoys observing people and studying their interactions, perhaps as a way to understand human nature better. He seems drawn to the city's underbelly, exploring alleys and abandoned areas where others might find danger or discomfort.

It is also possible that Zoltan has an interest in history and the social dynamics of the city, given his ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues to solve complex cases. His own troubled past remains largely unexplored, leaving room for speculation about what drives him as a detective and as a person.
