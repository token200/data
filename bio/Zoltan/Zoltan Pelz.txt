His fascination with the peculiar and unknown seems to drive his passions, leading him to acquire an eclectic assortment of taxidermied creatures, ancient scrolls, and strange devices that whirr and tick. He has a deep appreciation for the finer things in life and is drawn to individuals who share his curiosity about the world's mysteries.

**Additional Details:** Zoltan Pelz seems to be a master of subtlety, preferring to let his presence speak for itself rather than drawing attention to himself through grand displays or overt statements.
