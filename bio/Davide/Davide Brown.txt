Here's a summary of Davide Brown's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Davide is an unconventional thinker, often approaching problems from unorthodox angles. He has honed his skills in surveillance and observation through his experience as a former street artist, allowing him to think creatively and outside the box. Despite being few and far between, Davide's clients appreciate his unique approach, which makes them feel like they're getting something no one else can offer.

Davide is likely fiercely independent and self-reliant, having had to rely on himself for years as a street artist. This has instilled in him a strong sense of confidence and determination. However, he may also be introverted or quiet in social situations, preferring to observe rather than dominate the conversation.

**Physical Attributes:** Davide stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his angular face with a sharp jawline and piercing green eyes that seem to see right through you. He has a small nose ring and a collection of subtle tattoos on his arms, giving him a rugged, edgy appearance.

**Interests:** Davide's artistic background is evident in his interests outside of detective work. He loves street art, music, and photography, often using these skills to gather information or express himself. As a former street artist, he has a deep appreciation for the urban landscape and the way it can be transformed into something beautiful.

Davide also enjoys the thrill of the hunt and is drawn to cases that push him out of his comfort zone. He's fascinated by human behavior and psychology, often studying body language and mannerisms to better understand people and predict their actions.

When not working on a case, Davide can be found exploring new neighborhoods, attending underground art events, or practicing yoga to center himself. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for stray animals and lost causes, often taking on cases that others might find too obscure or unprofitable.
