**Personality:**
Davide Larsen is a complex individual with multiple layers to his personality. On one hand, he appears introspective, disconnected, and even mysterious to those around him. He has chosen solitude over the luxuries of his family's wealth, indicating a desire to break free from societal expectations and responsibilities.

On another level, Davide shows signs of deep-seated longing for human connection and love. His emotional response to Sofia's visit reveals vulnerabilities he had kept hidden, showcasing an inner depth and capacity for empathy. This contrasts with the initial perception that Davide is a recluse who has become numb to the world around him.

**Interests:**
Davide's interests are likely centered around nature, exploration, and possibly solitude itself as a source of personal growth and reflection. Given his past life on the outskirts of society and spending years in remote wilderness areas, he might have developed a deep respect for the natural world, learning survival skills, herbalism, or some other form of primitive knowledge.

Additionally, with his newfound openness to exploration alongside Sofia, it's possible that Davide has an interest in exploring new places, meeting people, and experiencing life in all its complexities. This contrasts sharply with the isolation he once chose for himself, showing a capacity for growth and change.
