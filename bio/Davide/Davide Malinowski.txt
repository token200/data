Here is a short summary of the fictional character Davide Malinowski:

**Physical Attributes:** Davide stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming presence. His eyes are a deep brown, reflecting his introspective nature. He has unruly brown hair that often falls across his forehead, adding to his slightly disheveled appearance. Despite the cluttered state of his apartment, he exudes a sense of intelligence and quiet confidence.

**Personality:** Davide is an intensely driven individual with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the past. His obsession with Niccolò Machiavelli's work has consumed him, leading to late-night sessions spent pouring over dusty books and manuscripts. He is fiercely independent and values his autonomy above all else. This independence stems from a troubled past, where he struggled to find stability in academia before being approached by the wealthy collector.

**Interests:** Davide's primary interest lies in unraveling the secrets of Niccolò Machiavelli's life and work. His research focuses on deciphering historical documents, analyzing political strategies, and understanding the intricacies of power dynamics within city-states like Florence. He is also intrigued by forgotten histories and is always on the lookout for new leads to further his research.

**Additional Insights:** Davide's fascination with Machiavelli extends beyond mere academic curiosity. He sees parallels between his own life and that of the historical figure, suggesting a deep emotional connection to the subject matter. This connection fuels his quest for truth, driving him to continue uncovering hidden secrets and shedding light on the enigmatic past.

**Habits:** Davide has developed a few habits as a result of his intense focus on his research: he often neglects self-care activities like exercise or socializing, prioritizing instead the pursuit of knowledge. His loyal cat, Luna, provides emotional support during these solitary sessions, and she is always by his side when he delves into his most critical work.

**Goals:** For now, Davide's primary goal remains deciphering the rare Machiavellian manuscript. As he progresses in his research, he hopes to contribute meaningfully to the field of ancient history and shed new light on the intricate world of 16th-century politics. His ultimate dream is to write a groundbreaking book that would cement his place as an expert in the field.
