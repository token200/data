Davide is a introspective and creative individual who often struggles with feelings of overwhelm and disconnection from his passion for writing.

Despite this connection, he sometimes feels like he's losing touch with that passion due to the demands of freelance work. Davide is introspective and values meaningful conversations, as seen when he strikes up a conversation with the owner of "The Written Page."

**Interests:**
- Writing (especially creative non-fiction and storytelling)
- Cultural heritage and history
- Reading (particularly literature from India and authors who explore themes of identity and belonging)

As a native New Yorker, Davide has developed a strong appreciation for the city's diversity and energy. However, he often craves quieter moments to reflect on his writing and connect with his roots. His experiences at "The Written Page" have reignited his passion for storytelling, and he now seeks out opportunities to explore themes of identity and cultural heritage in his work.
