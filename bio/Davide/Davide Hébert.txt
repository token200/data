**Physical Attributes:** Davide is a man in his late thirties with an unruly brown hair and a scruffy beard. He has an unremarkable appearance that makes him feel like an outsider in the city he calls home.

**Personality:** Davide is a introspective person who has struggled to find his place in the world. Growing up, he was content to spend time exploring the woods and fields surrounding his suburban home, but life took a different turn when he dropped out of college due to financial constraints. He has worked odd jobs to make ends meet, which has made him somewhat stoic and independent. Despite this, Davide is not unemotional; he feels deeply and is sensitive to the emotions of those around him.

He also enjoyed exploring the city's hidden corners, discovering secret gardens and underground art galleries. After pulling away from Elara, Davide started to explore new hobbies and interests, such as possibly starting a business or traveling the world.
