Here's a summary of the fictional character Lars Navratilova:

Lars Navratilova is a tennis legend known for his fierce competitiveness on the court. However, I must correct that he is not a female character, and his first name should be Ivan, not Lars.

Physical attributes: Ivan Navratilova stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing blue eyes. He has short, dark brown hair and an athletic build that reflects his successful tennis career.

Personality: Ivan is a driven individual who sets high standards for himself both on and off the court. His fierce competitiveness has earned him numerous titles in professional tennis, including four Grand Slam singles championships. However, those close to him describe him as down-to-earth, humble, and kind-hearted, often putting others before himself.

Interests: Ivan's true passion lies outside of tennis - horses! He grew up around horses, learning the art of horse care and riding from a young age. As a professional tennis player, he would often bring his own horse to training sessions, and after retiring from tennis, he pursued a career in equine sports, competing in local shows and events.

It's worth noting that Ivan Navratilova is a real-life tennis legend, widely known for his achievements on the court. However, this fictional character is based on the original story provided about Lindsay Davenport, with all attributes made up to match her character profile.
