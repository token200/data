Despite his brooding nature, he possesses a deep empathy for others, which he channels into his photography to capture the beauty in decay and neglect. He is fiercely independent and guarded, having been shuffled between foster homes as a child, leaving him with a strong sense of self-preservation.

* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that seem to hold a depth of sadness
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with subtle scars on his cheeks and nose, hinting at a troubled past

**Interests:** Lars is an avid street photographer who finds solace in capturing the beauty in urban decay. He is drawn to crumbling facades, rusted pipes, and forgotten gardens, which he believes hold secrets and stories of their own. His lens seeks to expose the hidden truths behind these neglected spaces, revealing a deeper narrative that speaks to his own experiences of displacement and fragmentation.

In addition to his photography, Lars has a deep appreciation for the city's alleys and streets, finding solace in the quiet moments spent wandering through the shadows. He is also an avid reader of philosophy and literature, often seeking guidance from the works of thinkers like Baudelaire and Nietzsche to inform his own introspective nature.

His encounters with others are fleeting and guarded, yet he possesses an uncanny ability to connect with those who seek him out, like Sophie, the young woman who dared to unravel the enigma that shrouds him.
