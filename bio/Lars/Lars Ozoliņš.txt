However, when he is lost in music, he becomes completely absorbed in the moment, allowing his passion to guide him. He is fiercely independent and self-sufficient, having learned to rely on himself after years of solitude. Despite this, Lars has a deep empathy for others, particularly those who are struggling to find their place in the world.
