Based on the short story about Basheera Woźniak, I've created a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Basheera Woźniak is a tall and slender woman, standing at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet gaunt build. Her eyes are a deep, piercing brown that twinkle with intensity when she's focused on her work. She has long, curly dark hair that often escapes her worn notebook or falls in loose waves down her back.

**Personality:** Basheera is a brilliant and intensely driven individual, with a passion for mathematics that borders on obsession. Despite her reclusive nature, she has a dry sense of humor and can be witty and sarcastic when pushed out of her comfort zone. However, her love for numbers and patterns can sometimes make her come across as aloof or distant to those who don't know her.

**Interests:** Basheera is deeply interested in mathematics, particularly chaos theory, fractals, and geometric patterns. She loves exploring the underlying structure of reality and finding new ways to model complex systems in nature. As an artist, she is inspired by the beauty of shapes and patterns, and sees her work as a form of artistic expression. Her favorite artists include Pollock and M.C. Escher, who share her fascination with geometry and pattern.

Overall, Basheera Woźniak is a unique blend of intellect, creativity, and passion, with a deep love for mathematics and art that drives her to push the boundaries of both fields.
