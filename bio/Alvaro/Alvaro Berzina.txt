Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Alvaro Berzina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alvaro Berzina exudes an aura of quiet confidence that commands attention. He appears to be calculating and observant, with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up and searching for something hidden beneath the surface. This suggests that Alvaro is intelligent, strategic, and possibly has a dry sense of humor, given his reputation as "The Ghost". His momentary lapse in the mirror reveals a more human side, suggesting that despite his mastery of stealth and deception, he may be haunted by self-doubt or introspection.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green
- Hair Color: Dark brown, potentially messy or unkempt due to his profession
- Skin Tone: Olive or tanned, suggesting regular exposure to sunlight
- Facial Features: Sharp jawline, prominent nose, and a small scar above the left eyebrow, hinting at a troubled past

**Interests:** Alvaro's primary interest appears to be the acquisition of rare and valuable artifacts. He is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world around him, particularly in relation to historical relics and mysterious objects. His skills as a thief suggest that he may have a fascination with the intellectual challenge of outwitting his pursuers, but it's also possible that this aspect of his profession stems from a desire for validation or recognition.

Given Alvaro's background as a master thief, his interests may extend to other areas such as:

- Collecting rare books or documents
- Exploring hidden passages and secret chambers
- Learning about mythology, history, or ancient cultures
- Participating in underground art or music scenes

It is essential to note that these details can be developed further based on the context of the story.
