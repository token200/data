Here's a summary of Milan Morel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Milan Morel is a quiet and unassuming man in his mid-to-late 50s. He stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender build. His hair is gray and combed to the side, revealing a prominent forehead. His eyes are a warm, honey-brown color that seem to sparkle with warmth when he talks about music. His nose is slightly crooked, as if it's been broken at least once in his life.

**Personality:**
Milan is a gentle soul with a deep love for music and storytelling. He is a listener, often preferring to absorb the sounds and emotions of those around him rather than seeking to draw attention to himself. Despite his reserved nature, Milan has a warm heart and is drawn to people who share his passions. He is patient, kind, and has a calming presence that puts others at ease.

**Interests:**
Milan's love of music is all-consuming. As a child, he was enchanted by the melodies and harmonies of French folk songs, which sparked his interest in playing the guitar. Over the years, he developed a wide range of musical tastes, from jazz to classical, and spent countless hours listening to vinyl records and practicing on his guitar. When he's not playing or reading, Milan enjoys tending to his garden, where he cultivates flowers and herbs that remind him of his childhood.

Despite his love for music, Milan is also a voracious reader, devouring classics by authors like Austen, Dickens, and Tolstoy. He finds solace in the words and worlds they create, which often mirror the emotions and themes that are present in the music he loves. When he meets new people, Milan is drawn to those who share his love of literature or storytelling through melody, as he has with Colette.

In short, Milan Morel is a quiet, introspective man whose passion for music brings him joy, purpose, and connection with others.
