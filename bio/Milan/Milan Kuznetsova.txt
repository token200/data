Here is a summary of the fictional character Milan Kuznetsova:

**Physical Attributes:** Milan stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build, honed from her years as a professional ballerina. Her piercing green eyes are a striking feature, seeming to gleam with mischief and intelligence. Her dark hair is often styled in an elegant updo, a nod to her ballet roots.

**Personality:** Milan is a confident and calculating individual, always staying one step ahead of those around her. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp mind, allowing her to navigate complex situations with ease. Despite her tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and emotional depth, suggesting that she may be more than just a skilled thief.

**Interests:** Milan is passionate about dance and the thrill of performance. As a former ballerina, she has a deep appreciation for the art form and its technical aspects. Her love of movement and expression is still evident in her high-stakes heists, where she uses her agility and coordination to evade security systems.

In addition to her love of dance, Milan seems to have an interest in luxury and opulence, often targeting high-end artifacts and treasures as part of her heists. She also appears to be drawn to the world of finance and business, with her alliance with Alexander and their plan to pull off the legendary Faberg√© egg.

**Other Details:** Despite her polished exterior, Milan has a troubled past, hinted at by her mother's pushy behavior during her ballet training days. This early experience may have contributed to her desire for independence and autonomy in later life. Her connection with Alexander adds another layer to her personality, revealing a complex individual who is both calculating and passionate.
