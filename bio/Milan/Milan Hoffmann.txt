Here is a summary of Milan Hoffmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Milan Hoffmann stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost purple in the right light, which seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Milan is a complex individual with a mix of emotions and insecurities. On one hand, he is fiercely independent and guarded, having built walls around himself due to past experiences. This stems from a deep-seated fear of vulnerability and rejection. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a compassionate and empathetic person who longs for human connection. As the story progresses, we see Milan's resolve weaken, revealing a vulnerable soul struggling to break free from his emotional shackles.

He appears to be someone who appreciates the beauty of nature, as he notices the old oak trees lining the streets. His interest in history is also evident, as his father shares stories about their past. Additionally, Milan seems to be a curious individual, driven by a desire to learn more about himself, his family, and his place in the world.
