Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Milan Olsen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Milan Olsen stands at 6 feet 2 inches tall, with an athletic build that he maintained during his time in the military. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, while his eyes are a deep blue, haunted by the experiences of his past. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a particularly brutal mission.

**Personality:**
Milan is a complex and introspective individual, with a dry sense of humor that he uses to deflect from his true emotions. Growing up, he was always a bit of a loner, but after leaving the military, he struggled to connect with others. He has a tendency to push people away, afraid of getting hurt or letting anyone in. However, once he finds someone who genuinely understands and accepts him, like Sofia, he becomes fiercely loyal and protective.

**Interests:**
Milan's interests are varied but mostly revolve around art, music, and literature. As an avid painter, he draws inspiration from the world around him, often incorporating themes of war, loss, and redemption into his work. He is also a fan of old jazz records, which provides him with a sense of comfort and nostalgia. When not painting or listening to music, Milan enjoys long walks in the city, taking in the sights and sounds that inspire him.

Despite his troubled past, Milan has a deep capacity for love, kindness, and empathy. As he finds himself falling in love with Sofia, he begins to confront his demons and slowly rebuilds his sense of purpose and belonging.
