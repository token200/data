**Personality:** Milan appears to be introspective and creative, with a deep connection to music and poetry. He is also somewhat introverted, as evidenced by his preference for a dimly lit jazz club where he can lose himself in the sounds around him. His demeanor suggests that he may be emotionally complex, as hinted at when the bartender notices "a knowing glint" in her gaze.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: Milan's height is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context of the story, it appears to be average or slightly below-average, allowing him to blend into the crowd.
- Eye Color: His eye color is not specified, but given his Scandinavian background and affinity for the melancholic atmosphere of a rainy Berlin evening, one could imagine his eyes being a deep blue or grey, complementing the somber mood of his surroundings.

**Interests:** 
Milan's primary interests seem to revolve around music, particularly jazz and blues. He is deeply inspired by the sounds and melodies he hears in these genres, which evoke a sense of melancholy and longing in him. As a poet, he finds solace in collecting thoughts and crafting words that capture the essence of his emotions, drawing inspiration from the world around him.

However, Milan's relationship with responsibility and his "poet's skin" suggests that there may be an underlying struggle within him to balance creativity with external obligations or expectations. This internal conflict could serve as a rich source for personal growth and exploration in further stories about Milan Stenström.
