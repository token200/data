Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Milan de' Medici:

**Personality:** Milan is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, she appears confident and poised, having been taught from a young age how to navigate the intricate world of politics and alliances that comes with being a member of the powerful Medici family. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a restless spirit, yearning for something more meaningful in life. She is introverted and independent, often feeling suffocated by the expectations placed upon her as a noblewoman. Milan's true self is one of passion and creativity, and she craves autonomy to explore her own voice and interests.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Hair Color: Rich, dark brown
* Facial Features: Heart-shaped face with high cheekbones, full lips, and a small nose

Milan's physical appearance reflects her refined yet reserved nature. Her striking features and piercing eyes make her stand out in the crowd, but she has always felt like an outsider among her own family.

**Interests:** Milan is a creative soul, drawn to literature, philosophy, and poetry. She finds solace in the works of Dante and Guido Cavalcanti, and begins to explore her own voice through writing. Her interests also extend to politics and social justice, as she becomes increasingly disillusioned with the shallow world of Medici politics.

After discovering Leonardo's bookstore, Milan develops a deep love for books on philosophy and politics, which allows her to question the status quo and challenge the norms that have governed her life until now. As she finds her own path forward, her interests will likely continue to evolve, but at their core, they remain centered around self-discovery, creativity, and making a positive impact in the world.
