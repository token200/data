**Personality:**
Milan Romanova is an enigmatic and complex individual. She has a commanding presence on stage, exuding confidence and elegance. However, behind the fa√ßade lies a troubled soul struggling to come to terms with her past. Milan is fiercely independent and guarded, having built a wall around herself to protect her inner demons. Despite this, she is intensely passionate about dance and uses it as an outlet for her emotions.

**Interests:**
