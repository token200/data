Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Levente Horv치th:

**Personality:** Levente Horv치th is a provocative and confident individual who is not afraid to challenge the status quo. He is passionate about his art and is willing to take risks to push boundaries and spark important conversations. Despite the criticism he receives, Levente remains committed to his artistic vision and is driven by a desire to challenge reality itself.

**Physical Attributes:** Levente Horv치th stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build. His eye color is piercing blue, which seems to bore into those he meets with intensity. His hair is often unkempt, adding to his air of nonconformity. His style is eclectic and avant-garde, reflecting his artistic personality.

**Interests:** Levente Horv치th has a deep fascination with the concept of postmodernity and its relationship to reality. He is particularly drawn to the works of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who wrote extensively on the idea that our perception of reality is constantly shifting and that understanding of the world is inherently subjective. As an artist, Levente seeks to capture this subjectivity in his work by incorporating unconventional materials and techniques.

In addition to his interest in philosophy and art, Levente also has a practical side. He is likely familiar with construction sites and consumer goods, having used detritus from these sources as the foundation for some of his canvases.
