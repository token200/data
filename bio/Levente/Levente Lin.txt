She also seems to appreciate the art of tea ceremonies, as evidenced by her respect for Master Hiro's invitation to share a cup of green tea.

Additionally, given her connection to the Kageyoshi clan, it is likely that Levente Lin has an interest in Japanese culture, history, and philosophy.

**Other Details:** As a member of the elite Kageyoshi clan, Levente Lin may have access to advanced training facilities, weaponry, and equipment. She likely spends time practicing her skills, honing her strategy, and studying ancient texts on martial arts, strategy, and philosophy.
