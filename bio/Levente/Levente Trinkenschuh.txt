Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a new character profile for Levente Trinkenschuh:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm) - Levente has a slender yet wiry build, allowing him to navigate through crowded spaces with ease.
* Eye Color: Bright, inquisitive blue eyes that sparkle with excitement whenever he discovers a rare find.
* Hair: Dark brown hair, often tousled and messy, which adds to his eccentric and charming persona.
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, a small nose, and a mischievous grin that hints at the thrill of the hunt.

**Personality:**

Levente is an adventurous soul with an insatiable curiosity for discovery. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of individuality, which drives him to stand out in a crowd. His passion for collecting rare artifacts knows no bounds, and he's always on the lookout for the next great find. Levente is intensely focused when searching for treasures but can be equally enthusiastic when sharing his finds with others.

Despite his keen eye for spotting hidden gems, Levente has a compassionate side and takes pride in uncovering forgotten relics that might otherwise go unnoticed. His infectious enthusiasm makes him a magnet for fellow collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate his zeal.

**Interests:**

Levente's interests are diverse and closely tied to his passion for collecting:

* Thrift store hunting
* Flea market exploration
* Antique shop browsing
* Local art discovery
* Vinyl record collecting (he has a fondness for vintage records by Austrian musicians)
* Cooking (he enjoys experimenting with traditional Viennese recipes in his spare time)

**Quirks and Habits:**

Levente often wears a faded, hand-me-down fedora hat and has an extensive collection of pocket watches that he's accumulated over the years. He carries a worn leather satchel to store his finds and is known for muttering cryptic phrases to himself when deep in thought.

In his free time, Levente likes to scribble notes on scraps of paper about potential treasures he's discovered and often spends hours pouring over dusty catalogs from old auction houses. This meticulous attention to detail has helped him develop an uncanny ability to spot hidden gems.

With this character profile, you can imagine the thrill of chasing after Levente Trinkenschuh as he navigates the winding streets of Vienna in search of rare artifacts and forgotten relics.
