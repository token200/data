**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel
- Build: Lean and average, possibly with some athletic build due to his daily commutes through the snow-covered streets.
- Facial Features: Unspecified but likely to be neutral, without any notable features that would stand out.

**Personality:**
Levente is a curious and slightly laid-back individual who often finds himself procrastinating on his tasks. He's late for work again in the story, which indicates his tendency to slack off at times. However, when faced with an unusual situation like Réka's apartment, Levente becomes more determined and engaged. His initial hesitation before investigating the apartment reveals a cautious side of him.

**Interests:**
Levente appears to be a casual browser of online memes, suggesting that he enjoys browsing social media platforms for leisure. He also has some interest in pop culture, mentioning an old TV show phrase when seeing Réka channeling energy.

However, it seems Levente lacks deeper knowledge or exposure to mystical practices and dark energies. The realization of the magnitude of what is happening around him is a pivotal moment that shifts his perspective on life in Budapest.
