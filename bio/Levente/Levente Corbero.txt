Here is a summary of Levente Corbero's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Levente stands at 5'8" with striking features that have made her an enigmatic figure in Barcelona. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up. Her dark hair is often styled in a messy bob, framing her heart-shaped face and pointed chin. She has a small tattoo of a sun on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a past altercation.

**Personality:**
Levente is a resilient and resourceful individual who has learned to rely only on herself. Her tough exterior hides a vulnerable person beneath, one that she has been forced to suppress in order to survive on the margins of society. However, with Maria's influence, Levente has begun to open up, revealing a more expressive and creative side to her personality. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries.

**Interests:**
Levente's interest lies in art, particularly painting and drawing. Her connection to Maria and the vibrant colors she sees on canvas has awakened a part of her that she had long suppressed. Levente finds solace in creating and expressing herself through art, using it as a means of processing her emotions and experiences. She is also drawn to the city's hidden corners and secret spaces, often exploring the Gothic Quarter and other neglected areas of Barcelona.

Additionally, Levente has an interest in storytelling and history, having grown up on the margins of society with limited access to education and information. Her past experiences have given her a unique perspective on the world, and she is drawn to understanding the stories and struggles of others.
