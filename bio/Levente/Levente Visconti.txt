**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Age: Appears to be in his late 60s or early 70s, but age is difficult to discern due to his enigmatic nature

**Personality:**
Levente Visconti is an enigmatic and reclusive figure. He appears to be a contemplative and introspective individual, often lost in thought as he takes long walks along the terracotta rooftops of San Gimignano. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a deep wisdom and intensity, which can be unnerving for those who cross paths with him.

**Interests:**
Levente's primary interest appears to be exploring ancient knowledge and forgotten secrets. He is said to possess a deep understanding of the whispers on the wind, which he believes carry messages from beyond the grave or contain hidden truths about the world. This fascination with the unknown leads Levente to spend his evenings listening to the whispers, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the past.

In addition to his interest in ancient knowledge, Levente seems to be drawn to the idea of communication with spirits or entities beyond the mortal realm. His whispered words on quiet nights are a testament to this fascination, and his ability to convey these secrets to those he chooses to share them with.

It is unclear whether Levente's interests extend beyond his nocturnal musings, but his enigmatic nature suggests that there may be more to him than initially meets the eye.
