Based on the short story, here is a summary of Egil Rodriguez Garcia's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egil has a reputation as one of the most feared warriors in the land, but despite his intimidating appearance, he has a heart of gold. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them, earning him many allies in the kingdom who look up to him as a hero.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Over six feet tall
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

Unfortunately, no other physical attributes are mentioned in the story, so I will make some assumptions:

* Hair Color: Dark brown or black, which complements his rugged features
* Build: Muscular and athletic, honed from years of battle training
* Facial Features: Rugged, with a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones

**Interests:** As a warrior, Egil's primary interest is in protecting others and bringing justice to those who have been wronged. However, it can be inferred that he also values:

* Loyalty: He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, which drives him to protect them at all costs.
* Honor: As a warrior, Egil likely has a strong sense of honor and will go to great lengths to uphold his code of conduct.
* Adventure: The story suggests that Egil enjoys the thrill of battle and the challenge of facing new opponents.

It's worth noting that these interests are not explicitly stated in the original story, but can be inferred based on Egil's actions and personality.
