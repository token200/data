Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Egil Kenji's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egil Kenji appears to be a complex individual with a rich emotional landscape. As a former soldier turned mercenary, he has likely developed a tough exterior to cope with the trauma and hardships of his past. However, as revealed in the story, he is also deeply empathetic and willing to help those in need, particularly children. He seems to have a dry sense of humor and can be guarded at times, but once he opens up, he shows a more vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:** Egil Kenji is likely a physically imposing figure, given his background as a soldier and mercenary. His height is not specified in the story, but based on the description of him trudging through the snow-covered streets and later helping the girl find her brother, it's possible he stands around 6 feet tall or more. His eye color is blue (although this may be inferred rather than explicitly stated). The scars on his hands suggest a history of physical confrontation and potentially hand-to-hand combat.

**Interests:** As a former soldier turned fisherman, Egil seems to have found solace in the quiet, methodical work of fishing. He appears to enjoy the rhythm of the sea and the sense of calm it brings him. However, his past continues to haunt him, and he is driven by a desire to make amends for past mistakes or traumas. His interest in helping others, particularly children like the young girl he meets on the beach, suggests that he values relationships and connections with others.

It's worth noting that Egil's interests may be more nuanced than those of a typical character. As someone who has seen extensive combat and has been shaped by his experiences, his hobbies and interests may be more introspective or personal, rather than seeking external validation or excitement.
