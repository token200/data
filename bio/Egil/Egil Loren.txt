**Personality:**

Egil Loren is a complex and enigmatic individual. On the surface, he appears to be a neutral and reserved person who keeps to himself. However, there is an air of quiet intensity surrounding him, suggesting that he may be hiding more than meets the eye. He is fiercely independent and has been traveling for so long that he has become accustomed to being alone. Despite this, Egil has a dry sense of humor and can come across as wryly humorous when speaking with others.

**Interests:**

Egil's interests seem to revolve around exploring new places and uncovering secrets. He has heard rumors about the Black Swan Inn and is drawn to it out of curiosity, much like a moth to flame.
