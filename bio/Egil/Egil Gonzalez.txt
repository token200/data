Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Egil Gonzalez:

**Personality:** Egil is a complex and mysterious individual with a tough exterior. Despite having a troubled past, he exudes a sense of charisma and confidence that commands respect from those around him. He has a natural intuition for danger and knows how to defend himself, making him a formidable opponent on the streets. However, this tough exterior also makes it difficult for people to get close to him, as they fear being hurt or taken advantage of.

**Physical Attributes:** Egil stands at 6'2" with an athletic build, which allows him to move with ease and agility. His piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a rough-around-the-edges appearance that belies his natural charm.

**Interests:** Egil's interests are largely centered around self-preservation and survival on the streets. He has no memories of his childhood or early years, so he relies on his instincts to navigate the world. However, when he meets Sophia, he begins to show a more vulnerable side, hinting at a desire for connection and community. He is drawn to Sophia's kindness and determination, and as they spend more time together, it becomes clear that he is also interested in exploring his past and uncovering the truth about his mysterious past.

In terms of specific interests, Egil likely enjoys activities that allow him to stay active and mobile, such as boxing or weightlifting. He may also be drawn to music and art, as a way to express himself and tap into his creative side. However, these interests are not well-developed in the original story, and can be expanded upon for further character development.
