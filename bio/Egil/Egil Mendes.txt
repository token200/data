Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Egil Mendes:

**Personality:** Egil Mendes is a man of mystery and intrigue with a strong sense of solitude. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a way of drawing people to him through his piercing green eyes and quick wit. He is a listener and a guardian of sorts, willing to lend an ear to those who need someone to talk to.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing Green
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, reflecting his former life as a special forces operative
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow

**Interests:** Egil's love of literature is matched only by his love of solitude. He spends most of his days surrounded by dusty tomes and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He has a particular fondness for rare books and is always on the lookout for new titles to add to his collection. His other interests include:

* Reading (especially classic literature and poetry)
* Writing (though he does not actively write, he appreciates a good story and enjoys listening to others' writing)
* Solitude (he values his alone time and finds it refreshing)
* The ocean (he loves the sound of the waves and often finds inspiration in its rhythms)

It's worth noting that Egil's past experiences as a special forces operative have left their mark on him, but he has worked hard to put those memories behind him. He is now focused on building a new life in his coastal town bookstore, surrounded by books and the soothing sounds of the ocean.
