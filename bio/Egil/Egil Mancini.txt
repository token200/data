**Physical Attributes:**
Egil is a 19-year-old man who stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his angular face and expressive eyes - which are an intense shade of blue that seems to see right through you.

**Personality:**
Egil is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. By day, he's a introverted and thoughtful artist who pours his heart into his paintings. He's creative, introspective, and compassionate, with a deep empathy for those who are marginalized or oppressed. As the Midnight Painter, however, he's bold, fearless, and unapologetic - using his art as a form of resistance against injustice.

**Interests:**
Egil is deeply passionate about social justice, and his interests revolve around creating art that sparks conversation and inspires change. He loves exploring the city's hidden corners, attending underground art events, and engaging with fellow artists who share his vision. He's also an avid reader of literature and poetry, drawn to writers like Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou, whose words capture the struggles and triumphs of the human experience.

In his free time, Egil enjoys experimenting with different mediums and techniques, from traditional painting to graffiti and street art. He's fascinated by the intersection of art and politics, and is constantly seeking new ways to express himself and challenge societal norms.

As the Midnight Painter, Egil finds solace in the city's vibrant streets at night - where he can lose himself in the flow of color and energy, and channel his emotions into something powerful and beautiful. His art is a reflection of his own soul, but also a beacon for those seeking to create change from within or with spray paint.
