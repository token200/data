He has a lean build, honed from years of playing music that requires agility and endurance.

**Personality:** Nurbek's personality is a complex web of contradictions, reflecting the enigmatic nature of his art. On one hand, he appears humble and unassuming, often blending into the background as he navigates social situations. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a passionate individual who refuses to compromise his artistic vision or sell out to commercial success. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having grown up in a community that encouraged him to explore his own interests and passions.

In addition to music, Nurbek's interests include exploring the intersection of traditional and modern culture, particularly in Kazakhstan. He sees "Khazan" as a reflection of his own search for meaning and belonging in a rapidly changing world. His enigmatic nature makes it difficult to pin down specific interests or hobbies outside of music, but it is clear that his art is a fundamental aspect of his identity.
