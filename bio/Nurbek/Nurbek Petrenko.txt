**Interests:**
Nurbek's passions are rooted in writing, boxing, and the natural world. He has always been drawn to the written word, spending hours poring over the works of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy as a young man.

Outside of literature and writing, Nurbek's interests are relatively simple: he enjoys a good cup of tea, and is often found lost in thought as he sips his tea and contemplates life.
