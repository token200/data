Here is a summary of María Bergström's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** María appears to be a warm, patient, and enthusiastic individual who loves sharing her passion for skiing with others. She values community and connection, as evident from her excitement about reuniting with friends and family in her hometown of Åre. Her experience abroad has broadened her horizons, but she remains humble and dedicated to her work at the ski school.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: María's height is not specified in the story, so I will make an educated guess that she stands around 5'6" (168 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not mentioned in the text either. Assuming a typical Swedish person might have blue or green eyes, I will choose a shade of light blue for María.

**Interests:** María's primary interests seem to be skiing, teaching, and sharing her love for adventure with others. She is passionate about breaking down complex techniques into manageable pieces, which suggests that she values patience and clarity in her approach. Her experience abroad has given her a newfound appreciation for cultural exchange and learning, but it appears that skiing remains her true passion.

Additional details:

* Age: María's age is not explicitly stated, but based on the context of returning after a year away and being an expert instructor, I estimate she might be in her mid-to-late 20s.
* Education Background: María completed a degree abroad (presumably in the United States) before returning to Åre. Her experience abroad broadened her horizons, but it's not clear if she has any other formal education qualifications beyond this.
