**Interests:**
Amelia is deeply passionate about art, particularly watercolor painting. She finds solace in the process of creating and losing herself in the colors and textures of her medium. Her grandmother's legacy plays a significant role in her artistic journey, as she learned traditional techniques from a young age.

Beyond her love for art, Amelia values solitude and quiet contemplation. She enjoys taking walks along the fjord, surrounded by nature's serenity, which clears her mind and sparks her creativity. Her interests also include introspection, self-reflection, and personal growth.
