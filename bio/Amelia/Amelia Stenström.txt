Based on the short story, here is a summary of Amelia Stenstr√∂m's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Amelia appears to be a introspective and emotionally sensitive person. She has experienced significant loss in her life, which has left emotional scars that still linger. Despite this, she shows resilience and determination, particularly when it comes to pursuing her passion for woodworking. Her sense of nostalgia and love for the past is evident, as seen in her attachment to the old photograph of her family.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide a detailed description of Amelia's physical appearance. However, based on the narrative, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Amelia appears to be an average or slightly above-average height, possibly around 5'6"-5'8" (168-173 cm).
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not specified in the story, but based on her introspective nature and nostalgic tendencies, it's possible that she has blue or green eyes.
* Hair Color: Amelia's hair color is also not mentioned, but it could be a dark brown or blonde color, considering the Scandinavian heritage hinted at by her surname.

**Interests:** Amelia's primary interest lies in woodworking, particularly woodcarving. She was trained in this art by her late father and showed great potential for it. However, she lost interest after his passing and let her skills gather dust. With the spark reignited within her, she begins to pursue woodcarving again as a means of creative expression and personal growth.

Additional interests or hobbies could include:

* Photography: Amelia's nostalgia for old photographs suggests that she might have an appreciation for photography as well.
* Nature: The mention of moonlight and the outdoors in her story implies that she might enjoy spending time in nature, perhaps finding inspiration from the natural world.
* History: As someone who cherishes memories of her family's past, Amelia may also be interested in history, particularly Scandinavian or cultural heritage.
