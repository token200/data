**Physical Attributes:** Stephane Mikhailov stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an slender build. His eyes are an unsettling shade of piercing green that seem to bore into those he meets, giving him an air of intensity and mystery. His hair is a dark brown color that often falls across his forehead in a messy sweep, framing his face with a hint of ruggedness.

**Interests:** Stephane Mikhailov's primary interest is his art, which is an extension of his inner realm and an exploration of the surreal and unknown. He is particularly drawn to the ocean and the eerie silhouettes of seagulls perched on wooden pilings or swooping low over the waves. He finds inspiration in the rhythmic motion of the tide and the way it taps into his creative wellspring, conjuring forth visions of twisted marine life and glowing, ethereal light.

Additional interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* Nature and the ocean
* The surreal and unknown
