Note: Given the original character's name is Stephanos (son of Flavius) and later referred to as Stephane Flavius Domitianus Augustus, I've taken creative liberties to adapt the details from the short story. The new character's physical attributes, personality traits, and interests have been tailored to fit a Roman warrior persona while maintaining some original characteristics.
