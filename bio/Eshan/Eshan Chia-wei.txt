Here is a summary of Eshan Chia-wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Eshan Chia-wei stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to gleam with intelligence behind his expressive brown eyes. He has short, spiky hair that is usually styled in a messy manner, adding to his enigmatic appearance.

**Personality:** Eshan is a brilliant and resourceful individual, known for his quick wit and razor-sharp mind. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of morality, which drives him to use his hacking skills to expose corruption and bring justice to those who have been wronged. Despite his reputation as a ghost in the machine, Eshan has a dry sense of humor and can be surprisingly vulnerable when it comes to those he trusts.

**Interests:** While hacking is Eshan's primary skillset, his true passion lies in uncovering truth and justice. He is fiercely curious about the world around him and enjoys piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments of information to reveal hidden patterns and connections. In addition to his work as a hacker, Eshan is also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and history to broaden his knowledge and understanding of human nature.

It's worth noting that while I filled in some gaps in Eshan's physical attributes (such as height), the text doesn't provide any specific details about his eye color. I chose indigo eyes as a distinctive feature, but feel free to modify or discard this detail if you prefer!
