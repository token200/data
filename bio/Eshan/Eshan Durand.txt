Based on the short story, here is a summary of Eshan Durand's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eshan appears to be a brooding and introverted individual, haunted by his past experiences as a soldier. He comes across as rough and guarded, with a tendency to push people away due to his past traumas. However, beneath this tough exterior, he is vulnerable and in need of human connection. He is drawn to Sophia's kindness and compassion, which allows him to open up and confront his demons.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair: Dark brown, cut short and practical for a soldier

**Interests:** Eshan seems to have lost interest in activities that brought him joy before his military career. However, as he begins to connect with Sophia, it is hinted that he may be drawn to artistic or creative pursuits. His time spent talking with Sophia over coffee suggests a desire for human connection and meaningful conversation.

It's worth noting that Eshan's past experiences have likely taken a toll on his mental health, and he may struggle with PTSD, anxiety, or depression. His interactions with Sophia suggest that he is beginning to heal and find hope, but it will likely be a long and difficult journey.
