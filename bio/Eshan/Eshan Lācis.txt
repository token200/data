Here is a summary of Eshan LƒÅcis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eshan is a driven and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely intelligent and has a keen mind for analysis, which serves him well in his detective work. Despite being consumed by the cases he investigates, Eshan has a compassionate side and is deeply empathetic towards those affected by the disappearances. His years of experience have honed his instincts and allowed him to develop a gut feeling that often guides his investigations.

**Physical Attributes:** Eshan stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, suggesting he remains physically fit despite his age. His hair is dark brown, cut short, and framing his angular face. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he interrogates, making him appear unyielding and authoritative. He sports a distinctive goatee that adds a hint of mystery to his features.

**Interests:** Outside of his work as a detective, Eshan has an abiding interest in the supernatural and the occult. The case of Emily Wilson's disappearance has reignited his fascination with ancient texts and mysterious organizations, which he hopes will help him crack the larger conspiracy behind the disappearances. In addition to his intellectual pursuits, Eshan is an avid reader and enjoys long walks along the city's waterfront, where he often reflects on cases and ponders new leads.

While not explicitly stated in the short story, I added the following details based on his personality and character traits:

* Age: Late 30s or early 40s, with a mix of experience and youthful vigor.
* Education: Eshan likely has a degree in forensic science, criminology, or a related field, which has provided him with the necessary training to excel as a detective.

Keep in mind that these details are purely speculative, based on the short story's inspiration.
