**Interests:** Eshan is a man of mystery with a deep love for the arts. He is particularly fascinated by the works of Spanish surrealist artists like Dalí and Miró. In his free time, he enjoys strolling through the winding streets of Madrid, taking in the city's vibrant culture and architecture. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, politics, and philosophy to keep his mind sharp and informed. Despite his love for intellectual pursuits, Eshan has a secret passion for painting, which he only indulges in when no one is watching.

As Sofia brings out the best in him, Eshan finds himself drawn to her creative energy and infectious enthusiasm. Together, they explore the city's hidden corners, sharing stories and laughter as they navigate the complexities of life and art.
