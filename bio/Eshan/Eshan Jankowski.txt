Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Eshan Jankowski:

**Personality:** Eshan is an enigmatic figure known for being a "lone wolf" with a strong sense of confidence and quiet determination. He has earned a reputation as one of the most brilliant minds in the city's law enforcement department, thanks to his exceptional observational skills and razor-sharp mind.

However, outside of work, Eshan remains elusive and private, with few people knowing anything about his personal life or interests beyond his love for reading, music (particularly jazz), and whiskey. He is a straightforward and principled individual who values truth and justice above all else.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair: Jet-black, falling across his forehead in a waterfall-like pattern
* Jawline: Sharp and angular, giving him an air of quiet confidence

**Interests:** Eshan's interests include:

* Reading (eclectic taste with books stacked haphazardly throughout his apartment)
* Music (vinyl records, particularly jazz)
* Whiskey (enjoying a sip or two in the evenings)
* Investigation and analysis
* Solving puzzles and mysteries
* Staying up-to-date on current events and politics

These interests are reflected in his personal space, which is cluttered with books and vinyl records, but still feels welcoming and intimate. His love for whiskey and jazz music suggests a sophisticated and introspective individual who values relaxation and self-expression.
