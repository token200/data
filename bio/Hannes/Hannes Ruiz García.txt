**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep, expressive brown eyes that seem to burn with an inner intensity
* Hair: Dark, curly hair that falls to his shoulders, often worn long and unkempt in a way that adds to his rugged, artistic persona
* Skin Tone: Warm, golden skin from spending countless hours outdoors playing music or practicing flamenco

**Personality:**

* Passionate and intense, with a fierce dedication to his craft
* Highly creative and expressive, always pushing the boundaries of what is possible in his music
* Loyal and true to himself, refusing to compromise or sell out for commercial success
* Has a deep connection to his heritage and culture, drawing heavily from flamenco and Spanish traditions in his work

**Interests:**

* Travel and exploration, always seeking new inspiration and experiences to bring back to his music
* Cultural exchange and collaboration, often working with artists from different backgrounds to create something truly unique and innovative
* Philosophy and spirituality, drawing on the existential and emotional resonance of John Coltrane's music as a source of inspiration

**Hobbies:**

* Playing guitar late into the night, lost in the sound and feeling of the music
* Dancing flamenco, either solo or with others, letting the rhythm and movement take over his body and soul
* Reading literature and poetry, drawn to the works of writers who explore the human condition and the search for meaning

**Quirks:**

* Has a habit of scribbling lyrics and musical ideas in the margins of his notebooks, often forgetting what they are as he moves from one piece to another
* Can get lost in thought when listening to music, often forgetting about his surroundings or the people around him
* Has a fascination with the abstract expressionism of modern art, seeing parallels between the fluidity and experimentation of jazz and the bold, unbridled colors of modern art.
