Here's a summary of Hannes Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Hannes is a complex and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a deep-seated need for secrecy and control, which was honed during his years as a Russian spy. However, after abandoning his life of espionage, he has begun to shed these traits and open up to new experiences and connections. Hannes is fiercely independent and non-conformist, but also has a strong sense of loyalty and duty, particularly when it comes to those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue-gray (with hints of silver in the right light)

**Interests:** Hannes is an avid sketchbook collector and appreciates the art of observation, which serves as a counterbalance to his former life of surveillance. He enjoys long walks along riverside paths, listening to classical music, and practicing calligraphy in his free time. As he becomes more comfortable with Sofia's presence, he begins to explore Eastern European folk music and dance.

As a carpenter's apprentice, Hannes also has a strong interest in woodworking and furniture-making, which serves as a creative outlet for him when the workday is over. He finds solace in working with his hands, sanding down wooden beams, and constructing pieces that evoke a sense of warmth and character.

These interests reflect Hannes' evolving desire to rediscover himself outside of his espionage persona, and to find meaning in a life that no longer revolves around secrecy and deception.
