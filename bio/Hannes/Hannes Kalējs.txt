Here's a summary of the fictional character Hannes Kalējs:

**Physical Attributes:** Hannes is likely to be in his mid-to-late 30s, with an unassuming appearance that belies his intellect. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm), which might make him slightly above average height for a Latvian male. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he talks to, hinting at his intense focus on the subject matter.

**Personality:** Hannes is portrayed as an introverted, yet intensely passionate individual who is not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom in pursuit of truth. He is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the fundamental laws of the universe. His dedication to his work is unwavering, often leading him to spend long hours pouring over data and running simulations. Hannes is also shown to be willing to collaborate with others, particularly his friend Jānis, indicating that he values intellectual camaraderie.

**Interests:** As a physicist, Hannes's primary interest lies in understanding the intricacies of quantum mechanics and unlocking new secrets about space-time. His passion for discovery drives him to study unusual phenomena, such as the anomaly occurring in the Baltic Sea. When not immersed in his work, he seems to appreciate the beauty of simplicity and finds solace in moments like the one described in the story.

Additional details that can be inferred from the provided text:
