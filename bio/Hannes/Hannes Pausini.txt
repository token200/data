**Additional Details:**

Hannes has a distinctive habit of collecting peculiar objects that spark his creativity. His studio is filled with these "found" treasures â€“ old books, antique artifacts, unusual stones, and so on. He believes that each item holds a hidden story or message, waiting to be uncovered and translated onto his canvas.

In his free time, Hannes often walks alone in the city's streets, observing people and their interactions. He finds this practice helps him tap into the human experience, which he then translates into art.
