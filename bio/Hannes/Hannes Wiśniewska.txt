Hannes Wiśniewska is a man in his mid-to-late 40s, with an unassuming presence that allows him to blend into the crowd. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem lost in thought, even when he's actively engaged in conversation.

**Personality:**
Hannes is a quiet and introspective person who prefers to keep to himself. He has an unassuming presence that makes him easy to overlook, but this also allows him to notice tiny details that others might miss. Despite his reserved nature, Hannes is fiercely dedicated to justice and will stop at nothing to solve a case. His colleagues often tease him about his "tunnel vision," which they see as a limitation, but he knows it's actually a strength in his line of work.

**Interests:**
Hannes is deeply passionate about justice and the pursuit of truth. He finds solace in the quiet moments after solving a case, when he can reflect on the satisfaction of knowing that justice has been served. Outside of work, Hannes is not much mentioned, but it's implied that he might enjoy walks or solitary activities that allow him to clear his mind.

It's worth noting that Hannes' personality and interests are heavily influenced by his role as a detective and his dedication to solving cases like the one involving Agnieszka's brother.
