Here is a summary of Mori Deschamps' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mori Deschamps is a highly skilled and deadly operative, but he is also complex and multifaceted. On the surface, he appears to be a ruthless assassin with no qualms about taking lives. However, as revealed in his interaction with Sophia LeFleur, he has a compassionate side that hints at a deeper emotional life. He is haunted by his past and struggles with the moral implications of his work, often finding himself torn between duty and personal conscience.

**Physical Attributes:** Mori Deschamps is of average height, around 5'10" (178 cm), with a lean and athletic build honed from years of training and physical activity. His eye color is an piercing shade of blue that seems to bore into those he meets, making them feel uneasy or intimidated. His hair is dark brown and often worn short, giving him a rugged and brooding appearance.

**Interests:** Mori's interests are largely focused on his work as an assassin for The Order. He is highly skilled in the art of stealth, hand-to-hand combat, and strategic planning. However, he also has a deep appreciation for music, particularly classical compositions that evoke a sense of melancholy or introspection. In rare moments of downtime, Mori might indulge in a whiskey or two, savoring the rich flavors as a way to calm his nerves after a particularly difficult mission.

It's worth noting that Mori's interests and personal life are somewhat limited by his role within The Order. He is constantly on call and must prioritize his duties above all else, leaving little room for personal hobbies or relationships outside of his work with the organization.
