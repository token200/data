Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Mori Durand:

**Personality:** Mori Durand appears to be a creative and introverted individual, comfortable with being alone and anonymous in public. She has an artistic side, as evident from her skillful violin playing. Despite her reserved nature, she is drawn to people who appreciate her music and values connection. However, there's also an air of mystery surrounding her, suggesting that she might be more complex than initially meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Mori stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to blend into crowds while still being noticeable.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are a deep brown, almost black, with subtle hints of gold in their undertones. This color is more muted than the piercing green of the stranger who captivated her.
* Hair: Mori's hair is dark and straight, often pulled back into a ponytail or tied up in a loose bun to keep it out of her face while playing.

**Interests:** It seems that Mori Durand is deeply passionate about music and its ability to evoke emotions. Her connection with the city of Tokyo, where she finds solace in performing on street corners, suggests an affinity for urban landscapes and the people who inhabit them. Additionally, her appreciation for avant-garde art implies a taste for the unconventional and unusual.

While we can't infer Mori's interests beyond music and art, it's possible that she also values connection and understanding with others, particularly those who appreciate her unique expression of sound.
