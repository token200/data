His short, dark hair is often slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and piercing features that seem to hold a world of secrets.

**Personality:**
Mori Szymanski is a complex individual with a mix of confidence and vulnerability. On the surface, he exudes an air of cockiness and bravado, which has earned him a reputation as one of the most feared and respected figures in the underworld. However, beneath this facade lies a deep-seated sense of morality and empathy, which often puts him at odds with his loyalty to Viktor Kuznetsov. Mori is fiercely independent and non-conformist, willing to challenge the status quo when he feels it's necessary.

**Background:**
As mentioned in the short story, Mori was born into a family of skilled con artists and learned the art of deception from a young age. He began small, swiping coins from market stalls and gradually worked his way up to more complex targets. Viktor Kuznetsov took Mori under his wing, teaching him the finer points of high-stakes thievery. However, after making the bold decision to turn down a job that went against his morals, Mori is now navigating the underworld on his own terms, seeking redemption and a chance to prove himself as more than just a feared figure.
