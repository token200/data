Her exact height is not specified, but based on the description of her moving through crowds with ease, she appears to be petite or slender. Her eye color is not mentioned explicitly, but given her Asian heritage (not explicitly stated), it is likely that her eyes are brown.

**Interests:** Mori's work as a freelance journalist and her investigation into the yakuza organization suggest that she has a strong interest in uncovering secrets and exposing corruption.
