Here's a summary of Mori Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mori is a charismatic and cunning master thief with a dry sense of humor. He has a natural air of detachment, making it difficult for others to get close to him. Despite this, he has a deep fascination with the thrill of the chase and the intellectual puzzle that comes with pulling off a successful heist. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, often staying one step ahead of his adversaries.

**Physical Attributes:** Mori stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of navigating the streets of Moscow as a young man. His eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, hinting at their depth and intensity. He has short, dark hair that's often styled in a messy, piecey manner.

**Interests:** Mori is deeply interested in art, history, and antiquities, which fuels his passion for theft and collecting rare and valuable items. He is also drawn to the intricacies of cryptography and coding, skills he acquired during his time as a young thief on the streets of Moscow. As an avid puzzle-solver, Mori finds joy in unraveling complex mysteries and outsmarting those who would seek to capture him.

**Additional Details:** Mori's past experiences have left emotional scars, making it difficult for him to form close relationships or trust others too easily. However, his encounters with Lena, the young hacker, have sparked a newfound interest in her company and perhaps even a hint of vulnerability beneath his rugged exterior.

It's worth noting that Mori's fascination with Lena has raised questions about his own motivations and values. As he embarks on this new adventure alongside her, he may find himself forced to confront his own emotions and the limits of his control over those around him.
