Here is a summary of Ira Chiatti's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:**
Ira appears to be a determined and dogged individual, driven by his passion for uncovering the truth. As a veteran journalist, he has seen it all and is not easily fazed by the gritty realities of his work. He is also cautious and analytical, as evident from his careful questioning of Samantha Wilson about her potential involvement in a setup. His instincts and experience seem to be guiding him through this situation.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** Ira's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on the description of Le Bete Noire's interior, he likely stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) - tall enough to stand out in a crowded space.
- **Eye Color:** The story does not mention Ira's eye color, but it is implied that his eyes are observant and piercing, which might suggest they are brown or possibly blue.

**Interests:**
Ira is deeply invested in investigative journalism and has a strong desire to expose corruption within the city government. His past cases - Maria Rosa, the East 14th Street sting operation, and Samantha Wilson's disappearance - all seem connected to larger conspiracies he aims to uncover. He also seems to have an interest in clearing the names of those who have been wrongly accused or affected by these schemes.
