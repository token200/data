**Personality:** Ira is a highly skilled and deadly fighter, with an air of quiet intensity. He exudes confidence and has a strong sense of self-reliance, as evident from his ability to navigate the crowded streets of Riga alone after being told he's on his own by Jānis. However, beneath his tough exterior, Ira appears to have a deep-seated trust in those he works with, demonstrated by his willingness to rely on Jānis for information and support.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - tall enough to make an imposing presence but still agile enough to move stealthily.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - a striking feature that seems almost piercing in the dim light of the café.

* Gathering Intelligence: He has a strong desire for information about new players in town who are engaging in "acquiring" business.
* Taking Down Threats: It appears that Ira is driven by a sense of justice and a need to protect himself and those he cares about from threats.
* Building Alliances: Although wary, Ira seems willing to form temporary alliances with others who share his values or can provide him with the necessary resources.
