Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Ira Ozoliņš:

**Personality:** Ira appears to be introspective and emotionally complex. He has a deep connection to the mysteries of life and is drawn to the melancholy aspects of human existence. As a child, he was fascinated by his grandfather's stories of love and loss, which sparked a sense of curiosity within him. This curiosity drives Ira to explore the unknown and seek answers to life's profound questions.

At 25, Ira seems to be at a crossroads in his journey, struggling with an overwhelming need to understand the human condition. He is quiet and observant, as evidenced by his barely above a whisper voice when speaking to the mysterious woman.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the story that can be verified. However, based on the description of the woman who boards the gondola alongside him, it's likely that Ira is not exceptionally tall or strikingly handsome. The text only mentions his eyes being "fixed" on the dark silhouette of the gondola, suggesting a certain introspective quality to his gaze.

If we had to speculate, let's assume Ira has average physical attributes for his age group, such as:

* Height: 5'9"-6'1" (175 cm - 185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or hazel, which complements his introspective and emotional nature

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that Ira is drawn to:

1. **Exploring the mysteries of life**: He has a deep fascination with understanding the human condition, love, loss, heartbreak, and longing.
2. **Nature and its beauty**: The frozen lake and gondola crossing spark his interest in exploring the natural world.
3. **Self-discovery**: His encounter with the mysterious woman sets him on a journey to uncover hidden truths about himself and the world around him.

These interests suggest that Ira is someone who values introspection, self-awareness, and an exploration of life's complexities.
