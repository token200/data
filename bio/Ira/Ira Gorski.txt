Her dark hair is shoulder-length and typically pulled back into a messy bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

Personality: Ira is an introspective and creative individual with a passion for art and photography.

However, when she is sparked by an idea or inspired by her surroundings, Ira becomes intensely focused and driven, pouring all of her energy into her work.

Interests: As mentioned in the short story, Ira is deeply drawn to urban landscapes and the raw energy they evoke. She has a natural affinity for photography, often capturing the intricate details of city life through her lens. Her latest project, featuring street artists and musicians, showcases her ability to see the beauty in unexpected places.

Other Details: In terms of hobbies or interests outside of art and photography, it is not explicitly stated, but given Ira's nature, she may enjoy activities that allow her to tap into her creative side, such as journaling, writing poetry, or practicing yoga.
