However, as she reconnects with her childhood self and finds comfort in friendship and connection, she begins to show signs of resilience and determination.

**Physical Attributes:** Ira Laan stands at 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with long black hair that falls down her back like a dark shroud.

She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of walking the beach and exploring the outdoors.

**Interests:** Ira Laan's childhood passions for building sandcastles and collecting seashells have not entirely disappeared. As an adult, she still finds joy in being near the water, whether it's watching the waves or simply taking a moment to breathe in the salty air. She is also drawn to nature - she loves to observe the changing seasons, note the patterns of the tides, and study the behavior of marine life.
