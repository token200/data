**Personality:** Eszter is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a heart of gold. She has a fiery personality and sharp wit, but beneath her assertive facade lies a sensitive and caring person. Her business acumen and strategic thinking make her a force to be reckoned with in the boardroom, but when it comes to those closest to her, she is a total softie.

* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a chic and sophisticated manner
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a warm, sun-kissed glow from her love of outdoor activities

**Interests:** Eszter is a multifaceted individual with a wide range of interests. As a successful businesswoman, she has a passion for entrepreneurship, leadership, and strategy. She enjoys attending networking events, reading business books, and exploring new markets.
