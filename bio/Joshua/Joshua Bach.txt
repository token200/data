He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, willing to challenge authority and stand up for what he believes in, even if it means going against the powerful. Despite his humble beginnings as a janitor, Josh possesses a deep intelligence and resourcefulness that allows him to navigate complex situations with ease.

**Physical Attributes:** Joshua Bach is approximately 5'9" (175 cm) tall and has brown eyes. His dark hair is often unkempt, and he has a scattering of stubble on his chin. He carries himself with a quiet confidence, wearing worn jeans and faded t-shirts that have been his go-to attire for years.

**Interests:** Josh's interests are largely centered around technology and problem-solving. As a former janitor, he spent countless hours tinkering with old computers in the closet, teaching himself basic IT skills. Outside of work, he enjoys researching and reading about social justice issues, as well as playing guitar and writing music (though this is not mentioned in the original story).
