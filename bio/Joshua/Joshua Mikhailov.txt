Based on the short story, here is a summary of Joshua Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Joshua is an enigmatic figure shrouded in mystery. He exudes an unnerving presence and an unshakeable sense of self-assurance, making others feel drawn to him while also being wary of his intentions. Despite the rumors surrounding him, he remains calm and composed, with a soothing voice that puts people at ease. He is perceptive and intuitive, able to read people's thoughts and emotions through his piercing blue eyes.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** Joshua stands tall, around 6'2" (188 cm), giving off an imposing yet confident presence.
* **Eye Color:** His piercing blue eyes are striking, seeming to bore into those he meets as if sizing them up before making his next move. They sparkle with a hint of mischief and warmth when he smiles.

**Interests:**

While we can't pinpoint Joshua's specific interests beyond his affinity for art and his mysterious past, it seems that:

* **Art**: He has an intuitive understanding of Emma's artistic talents and is drawn to her story, suggesting that he may have a deep appreciation for the creative process.
* **Psychology**: As someone who can read people's thoughts and emotions so easily, Joshua likely has a strong interest in psychology and human behavior. This could be linked to his background as a former spy or his ability to connect with others on a deep level.

It is unclear what else draws Joshua to Emma and their meeting at the caf√©, but it seems that he may have a personal stake in her artistic journey or perhaps sees potential for growth and development in her.
