Here's a summary of Joshua Nowakowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Joshua is a quiet and reserved individual with an air of confidence that commands attention. Despite his troubled past as a foster child, he has developed a strong sense of self-reliance and independence. He is intelligent and introspective, often lost in thought and contemplation. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep-seated desire for connection and belonging.

**Physical Attributes:** Joshua stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of solitude and manual labor. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his angular face and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a scattering of scars on his hands and arms, testament to his love of tinkering and DIY projects.

**Interests:** Joshua's true passion lies in the world of surveillance and counter-surveillance. He is fascinated by the intricacies of timekeeping, clockwork machinery, and the art of observation. The watch shop becomes an extension of himself, a sanctuary where he can lose himself in his work and find solace from the world outside.

Joshua's interests are also deeply rooted in history and technology, with a particular fondness for antique clocks and timepieces. He spends hours studying and restoring watches, seeking to understand their inner workings and secrets.

In addition to his technical pursuits, Joshua is an avid reader of books on philosophy, psychology, and sociology, which fuels his introspective nature and desire for self-awareness.

Despite his isolation, Joshua has a hidden talent for music, often playing the guitar in quiet moments of solitude. The sounds of the city outside provide a steady background noise that he finds soothing, much like the ticking clocks and whirring gears that fill his watch shop sanctuary.
