**Personality:** Joshua "Josh" Gustafsson is a free-spirited individual with a passion for adventure. He has a strong sense of restlessness and a desire to challenge himself, which led him to leave his life as a soldier. Josh is open-minded, spontaneous, and drawn to people who share his love for exploration. Despite having seen his fair share of battles, he is surprisingly vulnerable and willing to open up to others.

Unfortunately, no information is provided about Josh's height in the original story. However, based on his appearance as someone who "stared out at the vibrant souks" and was drawn to Maria's bright blue eyes, he may have a bit of an outdoorsy or rugged look to him.

**Interests:** Josh's main interest is adventure and exploration. He loves traveling to new places, experiencing different cultures, and pushing himself physically and mentally. He also values connection and community, as seen in his relationship with Maria, whom he finds a sense of belonging and understanding with.

Josh's love for adventure is all-encompassing, driving him to seek out new experiences and connections. His connection with Maria seems to have reignited his sense of purpose and belonging, allowing him to continue exploring the world alongside her partner in crime.
