**Personality:** Olli appears to be a skilled and resourceful individual with a strong sense of determination and professional curiosity. As a former KGB operative, he has been trained for countless scenarios, but his experience with the Qiyin has left him shaken. Despite this, he refuses to back down and instead channels his inner reserves to confront the entity. This suggests that Olli is a brave and resilient person who will not be easily intimidated.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only a few physical details are mentioned in the story:

* Eye Color: Brown or dark brown, as mentioned when Olli "felt a jolt of recognition" and his eyes "locked on the creature before him."

**Interests:** While not explicitly stated in the story, we can infer that Olli has an interest in:

1. **Exploration**: He is drawn to tracking and observing unusual phenomena, such as the Qiyin's presence on the lake.
