Here's a summary of Olli Cannavaro's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olli is a complex individual with a gruff exterior and a heart of gold. Despite being a stickler for rules and order, he has a kind and compassionate side that he reveals to those who earn his trust. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about, particularly Sophia, whom he becomes a confidant and friend.

**Physical Attributes:** Olli stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a rugged yet distinguished appearance. His thick grey beard, which he takes great pride in maintaining, frames his face and adds to his intimidating presence. However, his piercing brown eyes reveal a deep kindness and warmth that puts those around him at ease.

**Interests:** Olli's love for books and stories is well-documented, and he has spent countless hours studying and sharing them with others. He is an avid storyteller and enjoys spinning tales of adventure, bravery, and mythology to anyone who will listen. In his free time (when the library is closed), he loves to indulge in his secret passion for storytelling, using the firelight to bring his imagination to life.

In addition to his love for books and stories, Olli has a deep appreciation for order and discipline, which serves him well as a librarian. However, this trait also helps him guard his heart and keep others at bay until he feels comfortable opening up to them.
