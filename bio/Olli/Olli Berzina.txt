Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Olli Berzina:

**Personality:** Olli is portrayed as intelligent, passionate, and dedicated to her field of study. Her childlike wonder and curiosity about the natural world are evident in her awe-inspired gaze at the Grand Prismatic Spring. She is also confident and able to convey complex ideas to her colleagues and audience through clear explanations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a sharp, intelligent glint that hints at her analytical mind

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Olli is deeply interested in geology, environmentalism, and microbiology. Her research on microbial communities thrives within hot springs like the Grand Prismatic Spring captivates her attention, and she is driven to uncover their potential applications in biotechnology and environmental remediation.

It's worth noting that the physical attributes are not explicitly stated in the original story, so I have made some educated assumptions based on the narrative.
