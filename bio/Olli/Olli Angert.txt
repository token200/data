Here's a summary of Olli Angert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olli is a quiet and introspective person who values solitude and relaxation. He has a warm and welcoming nature, particularly when it comes to those he cares about, as evident in his response to Loki's presence and Lotta's arrival. Despite his laid-back demeanor, Olli appears to be quite observant and thoughtful, as evidenced by his attention to Lotta's stories of adventure and resilience.

**Physical Attributes:** Olli is described as being slightly above average height for a male (though the exact measurement isn't specified). His eye color is not mentioned in the provided text, but based on his reaction to Loki's piercing green eyes, it can be inferred that he likely has similar-colored eyes. Other physical attributes, such as skin tone and body shape, are not specified.

**Interests:** Based on Olli's occupation at the local caf√© and his appreciation for freshly brewed coffee, it is reasonable to assume that he enjoys a quiet evening in with good company and perhaps some literary or philosophical pursuits (given his ability to appreciate Lotta's stories of adventure and resilience). He may also have an interest in photography, given Lotta's profession as a photographer.
