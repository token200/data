Here's a summary of Olli (Lexi) Klein's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lexi is a creative and resourceful individual who thrives in chaotic situations. She is a natural problem-solver with a passion for innovation and experimentation. Her confidence and determination are evident as she navigates unexpected setbacks, such as the supplier shortage, with ease and quick thinking. Despite her professional demeanor, Lexi has a playful and enthusiastic side, evident in her interactions with Emma and her excitement when creating new recipes.

**Physical Attributes:** Lexi stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with long, curly brown hair that falls just below her shoulders. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with creativity, and she often has a smudge of flour or sugar on her nose, hinting at her love for baking.

**Interests:** Lexi's primary interest is baking, particularly pastry-making. She is an avid cookbook collector and online forum enthusiast, always seeking new inspiration and techniques to incorporate into her recipes. Her passion for baking also stems from her childhood memories of watching her grandmother create intricate pastries in their cozy kitchen. When not experimenting with new flavors or running Sugar & Spite, Lexi enjoys sharing her love of baking with others through cooking classes, workshops, and social media.

As an aside, I made up some details to flesh out Olli's character, such as the description of her physical attributes and interests. The story didn't provide many details about her personality beyond her unorthodox approach to baking, so I expanded on those traits to create a more well-rounded character.
