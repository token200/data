**Personality:** Lorenzo is a brilliant and intellectually curious individual. He values knowledge and ideas above social conventions and expectations. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a quick wit and sharp tongue, which suggests that he is confident and articulate. His isolation stems from his inability to fit into societal norms, making him appear eccentric to those around him.

* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem lost in contemplation, possibly indicating a introspective nature.
* Build: He has a lean build, with a slight stoop to his shoulders that suggests he spends most of his time indoors surrounded by books.

**Interests:** Lorenzo's interests are centered around linguistics, history, and literature. He is deeply fascinated by the ancient languages, including Greek, and is always on the lookout for rare manuscripts or unique texts to add to his collection. His passion for learning and discovery drives him to explore the world beyond his studies, but he has long suppressed this desire due to societal expectations.
