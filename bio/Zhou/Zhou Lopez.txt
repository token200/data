Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Zhou Lopez:

**Name:** Zhou Lopez

**Age:** Late teens to early twenties (approximately 17-22 years old)

**Height:** Zhou Lopez stands at around 5'7" (170 cm) with a lean and agile build, typical of his calligraphy training.

**Eye Color:** His eyes are a deep, rich brown that seem to sparkle with curiosity and focus when he's practicing calligraphy.

**Personality:**

Zhou Lopez is an introverted yet determined young man who is deeply passionate about mastering the ancient art of calligraphy. He is meticulous in his work, often losing track of time as he becomes absorbed in his studies. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when interacting with his master or fellow apprentices.

Zhou Lopez's relationship with his master, Master Wong, is particularly important to him. He respects and admires Master Wong's wisdom and expertise, and is fiercely loyal to him. At the same time, he values his own independence and wants to prove himself as a capable calligrapher in his own right.

**Interests:**

Zhou Lopez loves two things more than anything else:

1. **Calligraphy**: He spends most of his free time practicing and perfecting his craft, studying different styles and techniques from ancient masters.
2. **Mystery and History**: The mysterious scroll he discovered has sparked a curiosity in him about the secrets and legends surrounding Chinese history and culture.

**Physical Attributes (in addition to height and eye color):**

* Zhou Lopez's hair is dark brown, often styled neatly with a small amount of oil to keep it from frizzing.
* He has a subtle scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident involving a broken inkstone.
* His fingers are long and dexterous, well-suited for the delicate movements required in calligraphy.
* Despite his slender build, he is surprisingly strong for his age, thanks to years of physical training with Master Wong.

Overall, Zhou Lopez is a talented and dedicated young artist with a deep love for calligraphy and a burning desire to unlock its secrets.
