**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no mention of Zhou Tamm's height or eye color in the original story. However, we can infer some details about her physical appearance based on the cultural context. As a woman living in ancient China, it is likely that she would have had dark hair and eyes, typical of many East Asian cultures. Her height might be average for a woman from that time period, with estimates suggesting around 5'2"-5'6" (157-168 cm) tall.

**Personality:** Zhou Tamm appears to be an introverted person who is deeply connected to her art and culture. She is known for her exceptional talent in calligraphy, which suggests that she is patient, meticulous, and detail-oriented. Her willingness to travel long distances to showcase her work and her hesitation at first to meet the Emperor's request suggest that she may be shy or uncertain in new situations. However, once she finds a passion or creative outlet, she becomes fully engaged and expressive.

**Interests:** Zhou Tamm is deeply passionate about calligraphy and art, which is evident from the way she moves with precision and skill as she creates her works. She also seems to have an interest in spirituality and the symbolic significance of her creations, as people believe that her art holds spiritual power. Her meeting with the Emperor and commissioning a piece from him suggests that she values recognition and validation for her craft.

It's worth noting that these characteristics are inferred from the original story, and more information about Zhou Tamm would be needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of her personality, physical attributes, and interests.
