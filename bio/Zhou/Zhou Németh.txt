Based on the fictional character inspired by Zsófia Németh (Zhou), here is a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zhou is a free-spirited and creative individual with a passion for art and music. She is introspective and often lost in thought, but also has a curious and adventurous side that draws her to new experiences and people. Her imagination and curiosity drive her to explore the unknown, making her a kindred spirit to Professor László.

**Physical Attributes:** Zhou stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown, often described as "coffee-like" in color, which complement her rich dark hair. She has a small tattoo of a musical note on her left wrist and often wears eclectic outfits that reflect her artistic personality.

**Interests:** Zhou is a multi-talented individual with a strong passion for art (painting, drawing), music (singing, playing the guitar), and history (especially Hungarian culture). Her love for the past and its stories drives her to explore antique shops, museums, and historical landmarks. She also enjoys writing poetry and short stories, which often serve as inspiration for her artwork.

As she continued on her artistic journey, Zhou's experiences with Professor László and the mysterious box deepened her understanding of Hungarian culture and history, enriching her creative output and leaving a lasting impact on those around her."
