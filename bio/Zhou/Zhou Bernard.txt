Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Zhou Bernard:

**Physical Attributes:** Zhou Bernard stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a neat, sleek manner that accentuates his sharp jawline. His eyes are piercing green, a unique feature that has captivated art critics and collectors alike. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident involving clay and a broken pottery wheel.

**Personality:** Zhou Bernard is an enigmatic figure known for being fiercely protective of his creative process. He is introverted and reclusive, preferring to keep to himself rather than engage in the spotlight. Despite this, his art speaks volumes about his emotions, thoughts, and experiences, suggesting that he is a deeply empathetic and introspective person. Those who have met him report feeling an eerie sense of calm around him, as if they are being observed by someone who sees right through them.

**Interests:** Zhou Bernard's interests lie at the intersection of art, philosophy, and psychology. He is fascinated by the human condition, with a particular focus on themes such as identity, mortality, and the emotional landscape of modern life. His sculpture "Echoes," which has just debuted at the Museum of Modern Art, explores these ideas through his signature blend of texture, form, and symbolism. When not creating art, Zhou is an avid reader of existentialist philosophy, particularly the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.

As a person, Zhou Bernard is deeply conflicted, struggling to reconcile his creative passion with the demands of fame and public scrutiny. This tension fuels his artistic expression, resulting in work that is both hauntingly beautiful and profoundly thought-provoking.
