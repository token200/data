Based on the inspiration from Živjuze Bērziņš, I've created a fictional character profile for Zhou Bērziņa:

**Physical Attributes:**
Zhou Bērziņa is a 55-year-old male with a tall and slender build. He stands at approximately 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) with an athletic yet dignified appearance. His eyes are a deep shade of brown, reflecting his warm and intelligent personality. His dark hair is often neatly combed, framing his strong facial features.

**Personality:**
Zhou Bērziņa is known for his pragmatic approach to life, balancing logic with compassion. He is a natural leader, exuding confidence and authority in all his endeavors. Despite his strong convictions, he remains open-minded and willing to listen to opposing views. His calm demeanor and empathetic nature make him an effective mediator in even the most contentious disputes.

**Interests:**
Zhou Bērziņa is passionate about promoting economic development and stability, reflecting his dedication to Živjuze Bērziņš's legacy. He is particularly interested in sustainable infrastructure projects, trade policies, and innovative technologies that can enhance Latvia's competitiveness on the global stage.

When not engaged in politics or business, Zhou Bērziņa enjoys reading classical literature, practicing yoga, and exploring the scenic beauty of Latvia's natural landscapes.

Please note that this fictional character profile is inspired by Živjuze Bērziņš, but any resemblance to real individuals is purely coincidental.
