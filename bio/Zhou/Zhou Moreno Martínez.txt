**Personality:** Zhou is a seasoned and skilled member of "The Vigilantes," an elite task force that seeks to uphold justice in New Tokyo. He exudes confidence and leadership, as evident from his ability to coordinate with his team and execute complex strategies. Despite his tough exterior, Zhou shows a dry sense of humor, as seen in his wry remark about it being just "another night in New Tokyo." This suggests he has a more introspective side, possibly struggling with the moral implications of his work.

**Physical Attributes:** Zhou is a lean and agile individual, likely due to his extensive training in martial arts. His height is not explicitly stated, but based on his ability to navigate complex ventilation shafts and rooftop surfaces, it's reasonable to assume he stands around 5'10" to 6'2" (178 cm to 188 cm). His eye color is a deep shade of brown that seems almost indigo in certain lighting conditions.

**Interests:** Zhou appears to be deeply invested in his work as a member of "The Vigilantes." He's driven by a strong sense of justice and has an unparalleled skillset for infiltration, surveillance, and tactical planning. His interest lies not only in stopping notorious data brokers like Zero Cool but also in understanding the intricacies of New Tokyo's networks and uncovering hidden secrets.

In his downtime, Zhou might enjoy staying active through martial arts or other forms of physical exercise, maintaining a lean physique that allows him to move with ease throughout the city. Given his connection to the urban jungle, it's possible he has an appreciation for graffiti art, underground music scenes, or street food – anything that connects him to the vibrant energy of New Tokyo.

It's worth noting that Zhou's interests and personality might be shaped by his time spent working with his team and dealing with various underworld figures. As a member of "The Vigilantes," he has likely seen firsthand the darker aspects of life in New Tokyo, which could have contributed to his dry sense of humor and determination to uphold justice.
