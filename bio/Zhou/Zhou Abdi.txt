I'd be happy to help you with the character profile!

Let's assume that Zhou Abdi is a main protagonist from a recently created fantasy novel or young adult series. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Zhou Abdi is a brooding and introspective young man who has been forced to navigate the harsh realities of his world. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries simply for the sake of it. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect his loved ones.

Zhou is intensely loyal to those he cares about, but struggles with forming close relationships due to his troubled past. He's intensely curious and always on the lookout for new knowledge and experiences, often leading him into precarious situations.
