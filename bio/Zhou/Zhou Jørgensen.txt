Based on the short story provided, I've created a summary of Zhou Jorgen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Zhou Jorgen is a quiet and introspective person who has faced challenges in his past due to his mixed heritage. However, he has emerged as a successful artist, determined to make a name for himself. Despite emotional scars from childhood bullying, Zhou Jorgen is driven by a desire to find his place in the world.

Physical Attributes: As it's not explicitly stated in the story, I'll make some assumptions. Let's say that Zhou Jorgen is of average height (around 5'10" or 178 cm), with striking features that reflect both his Danish and Chinese heritage. His eyes are a deep brown color, reminiscent of his mother's Chinese roots.

Interests: As an artist, Zhou Jorgen has a passion for capturing the essence of Denmark through his paintings. He is drawn to landscapes, cityscapes, and the people who inhabit these environments. When not creating art, he seems to appreciate quiet contemplation and introspection, likely stemming from his experiences with bullying.

Please note that I've used some creative liberties to fill in missing details, while staying true to the character's essence as described in the original story.
