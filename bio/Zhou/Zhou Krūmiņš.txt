Based on the provided short story, I'll create a fictional character profile for Zhou Krūmiņš:

**Name:** Zhou Krūmiņš
**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Deep blue-green, almost turquoise

As inspired by Kristaps Krūmiņš from the story, Zhou seems to share a similar passion for photography and exploration. His height and eye color give him an adventurous and artistic vibe.

In terms of interests, Zhou is likely to be:

* Photography: A skilled photographer with a love for capturing the beauty of Riga through his lens.
* Exploration: Always on the lookout for new places to discover and hidden gems to uncover.
* Latvian culture: Intrigued by traditional cuisine, architecture, and customs, and often seeking inspiration from Zelta's stories.

Overall, Zhou Krūmiņš seems to embody a mix of creative energy, curiosity, and passion for life, much like Kristaps Krūmiņš in the original story.
