**Physical Attributes:**
Zhou D'Annunzio stands at 6 feet 2 inches tall, with an athletic build that reflects his ruthless and cunning nature. His piercing emerald green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential manipulation. His dark hair is slicked back, revealing a prominent forehead and sharp cheekbones. He sports a well-groomed beard, which adds to his aura of power and sophistication.

**Personality:**
Zhou is a master manipulator, using his charisma and intelligence to get what he wants from those around him. He is ruthless and cunning, with no qualms about crushing opposition or destroying anyone who stands in his way. Despite his cold exterior, there is an undercurrent of insecurity and desperation that drives him to maintain his grip on power at all costs.

**Interests:**
Despite his public persona as a ruthless businessman, Zhou has a secret passion for underground art movements that celebrate rebellion and individuality. He secretly finances these movements, using them as a way to subtly influence the culture and politics of New Eden.
