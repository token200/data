His unwavering dedication to his cause is inspiring, and he has a natural leadership quality that earns him the respect and admiration of his comrades.

**Physical Attributes:** Zhou Ming-che stands at approximately 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build that belies his incredible strength and agility. His piercing eyes are an intense shade of blue, often described as "ice-cold" by those who have seen him in battle. His dark hair is cropped short, revealing a strong jawline and prominent facial features.
