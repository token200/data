Despite his adventurous nature, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Personality:** Zhou is confident and self-assured, but also humble and open-minded. He is an excellent communicator and has a natural ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. His sharp mind and analytical thinking make him an exceptional problem solver, able to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions.

When not working on a dig site, he enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and practicing martial arts (Kung Fu). He is also an avid reader and has a particular fondness for historical fiction and adventure novels.

If you'd like, I can create a short story about Zhou Liepiņš's adventures in archaeology or explore his backstory to learn more about his motivations and personal struggles. Let me know!
