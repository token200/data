Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Alva Ivanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alva appears to be introspective, emotional, and possibly introverted. She has a strong connection with her grandmother, who was more than just a family member but also a confidante and mentor. This suggests that Alva values close relationships and may have a hard time opening up to others. Her feelings of anxiety and apprehension when stepping off the train indicate that she might be someone who struggles with change or uncertainty.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only one detail is provided in the story - Alva's eye color, which is not specified. However, I can make an educated guess that her height could be average to below-average (5'4" or 5'5"), given the context of her navigating a crowded station and walking down a busy hallway without seeming out of place.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that Alva values tradition and family history. She has a fondness for dark-roast coffee beans, which she bought during one of her visits back home. This suggests that she might be someone who appreciates comfort foods and drinks that remind her of her heritage. Her interest in exploring her grandmother's old trunk and mementos also indicates that Alva is curious about her cultural roots and family stories.
