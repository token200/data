Based on the short story, here is a summary of Alva Lindqvist's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alva Lindqvist appears to be a complex and multifaceted individual with a mix of cunning, intelligence, and emotional depth. As a survivor who grew up on the streets, she has developed a tough exterior and a resourceful nature. However, her mysterious past and encounters with her sister reveal a more vulnerable side, hinting at feelings of insecurity, loneliness, and a desire for connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Alva Lindqvist is likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, based on the story's context. She has long, dark hair (possibly braided or styled to convey her street-smart background) and piercing brown eyes that seem to hold a hint of sadness or intensity. Her height is average, but she carries herself with confidence and poise.

**Interests:** Alva Lindqvist's interests appear to be rooted in her past experiences as a survivor on the streets. She seems to be drawn to situations where she can use her wits and cunning to outsmart others, which suggests an affinity for games, puzzles, or competitive activities that challenge her intellect. Her ability to adapt quickly to new situations also implies a strong interest in survival skills, parkour, or other forms of physical agility.

Additionally, Alva Lindqvist's fascination with Mr. Johnson's high-society gala and her subsequent involvement in the game of cat-and-mouse suggest an appreciation for luxury, power dynamics, and social status. However, as she confronts her sister, her true interests may lie more in reconnecting with her past and understanding herself on a deeper level.

It is also possible that Alva Lindqvist has a fascination with the darker aspects of human nature, given her initial intentions to exploit Mr. Johnson's lavish lifestyle for personal gain. This could suggest an interest in psychology, criminology, or sociology, although more information would be needed to confirm this theory.

Ultimately, Alva Lindqvist's personality and interests are multifaceted and complex, reflecting both the harsh realities of her past and the uncertain promises of her future.
