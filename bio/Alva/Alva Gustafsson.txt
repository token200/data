**Personality:** Alva appears to be introspective and nostalgic, with a deep love for her hometown and the natural world. She has a mix of nostalgia and disinterest as she navigates her return to Härnösand, suggesting that she may have struggled to find purpose or direction in her life while away.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Green

It's worth noting that the original text doesn't provide much information about Alva's physical appearance, so these attributes are purely speculative. However, based on her description as being drawn to the natural world and having a calming presence, it's possible that she has features that are reminiscent of the sea or the outdoors.

**Interests:**

* Nature and the environment
* Exploration and discovery (as evidenced by her love of exploring the rocky shores and secret coves along Härnösand's coastline)
* Reconnecting with her past and reconnecting with herself (suggested by her return to Härnösand and her response to Gustav's gift of an old photograph)

Overall, Alva seems to be someone who values authenticity, connection, and a deep understanding of the natural world.
