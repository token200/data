**Personality:**
Alva is a brilliant, yet reclusive scientist who has spent her entire career studying the mysteries of the universe. Despite her impressive reputation as the "Queen of Black Hole Research," she remains humble and reserved, preferring to keep a low profile and avoid unnecessary attention. However, when it comes to her work, Alva's passion and enthusiasm are contagious, and she has a natural ability to inspire and motivate those around her.

As the story progresses, we see that Alva is initially hesitant and guarded, but eventually warms up to new ideas and collaborations. This reveals a more sensitive and vulnerable side of her personality, which is still hidden beneath her reserved exterior.

**Interests:**
Alva's primary interest is, of course, understanding the mysteries of the universe, particularly black holes. She is deeply fascinated by the secrets they hold and spends most of her time studying equations, data, and running simulations to unravel their enigmas.

In addition to her work, Alva also has a deep love for stargazing and exploring the vast expanse of space. When asked about her involvement in the project, she modestly credits others, but it is clear that her own curiosity and passion for discovery drive her work.

**Hobbies:**
While not explicitly stated in the text, we can infer that Alva might enjoy solitary activities such as reading scientific texts or working on her computer, given her love of research and equations.
