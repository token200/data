Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Alva Emi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alva Emi appears to be a curious and determined individual with a strong connection to nature. She is drawn to the mystical and has an innate sense of restlessness, suggesting that she may be searching for something more meaningful in life. Her sensitivity to energies and the natural world implies that she may have a deeper understanding of the spiritual realm. The fact that she feels a sense of recognition when meeting the Keeper suggests that she may possess a strong intuition or emotional intelligence.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only Alva Emi's hair color is mentioned in the provided passage. However, based on her description and the atmosphere of the forest, I'll fill in some additional details:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height suggests that she has a slender yet athletic build, which would allow her to navigate the forest terrain with ease.
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes (although this is actually the Keeper's eye color, as mentioned in the story). I'll assign brown eyes to Alva Emi instead, given the context of her long hair being "whipping in the wind."
* Hair Color: Long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall.

**Interests:** Given her connection to nature and the mystical realm, it's likely that Alva Emi is interested in:

* The natural world and its secrets
* Spirituality and the mysteries of life
* Self-discovery and personal growth
* Exploring the unknown and pushing beyond the boundaries of what she knows

As a young adult on a quest to unlock her destiny, Alva Emi's interests may extend to:

* Seeking wisdom and knowledge from ancient sources (like the Keeper)
* Developing her intuition and emotional intelligence
* Navigating the complexities of her own soul and heart
