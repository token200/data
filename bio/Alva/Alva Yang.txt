Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Alva Yang:

**Physical Attributes:**
Alva is a brilliant scientist in her mid-to-late 40s. She has an unassuming presence and often goes unnoticed due to her reclusive nature. Her height is around 5'8" (173 cm), and her eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into those she meets. Her dark hair is often tied back in a neat bun, revealing a smattering of fine lines etched into her forehead from years of intense concentration.

**Personality:**
Alva is an intensely focused and driven individual who has dedicated her life to unlocking the secrets of the universe. She is fiercely intelligent and possesses an innate curiosity that drives her to explore the mysteries of existence. Despite her reclusive nature, Alva has a dry wit and a hint of mischief in her eyes, which she often reveals when she's around those close to her. She is intensely private and prefers to keep a low profile, but once you earn her trust, she becomes fiercely loyal and protective.

**Interests:**
Alva's interests are centered around theoretical physics, particularly quantum mechanics and the mysteries of the universe. She finds solace in the complex equations and abstract concepts that govern the behavior of particles at the subatomic level. In her free time (which is rare), Alva enjoys reading about the history of science and philosophy, as well as practicing meditation to clear her mind.

Some additional details to flesh out Alva's character:

* Alva has a fondness for old, leather-bound books and keeps a small library in her laboratory that she returns to when she needs inspiration or a break from her work.
