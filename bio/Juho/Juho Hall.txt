**Personality:** Juho Hall appears to be an introspective and creative individual with a penchant for the darker aspects of human nature. He is described as having simple tastes and vices, often retreating into his own world of records, whiskey, and nicotine. Despite this, he has a spark of determination and creativity, which is reignited when he shares his thoughts and ideas with Anni. Juho seems to be struggling with self-doubt and feeling lost in life, but he also possesses a deep passion for art and a desire to create something meaningful.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height**: 6'2" (188 cm) - tall enough to fill the space of his cluttered studio apartment.
  
- **Eye Color**: Blue - a piercing blue that may seem almost otherworldly in its intensity, reflecting Juho's artistic and introspective nature.
  
- **Weight**: Average for his height, suggesting a lean build from years of creative activity rather than heavy physical labor.

**Interests:**

- Art (specifically provocative and installation-based art)
- Music (old records are mentioned as a source of comfort)
- Philosophy
- Creativity (not limited to art alone)
- Friendship (particularly with Anni, who serves as his confidante)
- Exploring the human condition through his work
