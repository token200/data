Mohamed Palmas is a 28-year-old Egyptian artist and traveler. He stands at 5'10" with an athletic yet lean build, often dressed in comfortable clothing suitable for his adventures. His eyes are an expressive shade of dark brown that seem to sparkle with creativity.

He has a deep love for traditional Arabic instruments and often incorporates their sounds into his art pieces. His travels have taken him across the globe, from bustling cities in Asia to secluded villages in Africa, where he seeks inspiration for his next masterpiece.
