Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Mohamed Saar:

**Name:** Mohamed Saar
**Age:** 28
**Height:** 6'1" (185 cm)
**Eye Color:** Warm hazel with golden undertones
**Physical Attributes:** Mohamed has a lean and athletic build, with broad shoulders and a strong jawline. His dark brown hair is often styled neatly, revealing his sharp features. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Mohamed is a charismatic and intelligent individual with a dry sense of humor. He is resourceful, determined, and fiercely loyal to those he cares about. As a creative problem solver, he thrives in complex situations and can think outside the box. However, his quick wit and sharp tongue can sometimes get him into trouble, making him more reserved around new people.

**Interests:** Mohamed is an avid reader of historical fiction and philosophy, often finding inspiration in classic texts like "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Gabriel García Márquez and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. In his free time, he enjoys playing guitar, practicing yoga, and exploring local cuisine. He has a passion for collecting rare books and vinyl records, which he displays proudly in his small apartment.

**Background:** Mohamed is a writer and journalist from Cairo, Egypt. Born and raised in a vibrant expat community, he developed a love for languages and cultures from an early age. He studied Arabic literature and journalism at the American University in Cairo before moving to New York City to pursue a career in writing.
