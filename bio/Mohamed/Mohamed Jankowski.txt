Here's a summary of Mohamed Jankowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mohamed Jankowski stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming build. His eye color is a deep, piercing brown that seems to hold secrets. His hair is dark brown, often worn neatly combed to the side of his head. He has a strong jawline and a gentle face, which belies the depth of emotion in his eyes.

**Personality:**
Mohamed's personality is a complex tapestry of introversion and introspection. Initially, he appears detached and reserved, observing the world around him with an air of detachment. However, as he opens up to Emily, it becomes clear that beneath his stoic exterior lies a kind and compassionate heart. He has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when he chooses to be.

**Interests:**
Mohamed's interests are not immediately apparent, but they become evident over time. He is an avid listener, able to pick up on subtle cues and empathize with others' struggles. He finds solace in quiet activities like reading (he favors classic literature) and painting, which helps him express the emotions he keeps hidden.

Despite his reserved nature, Mohamed has a deep love for music, particularly classical pieces that evoke a sense of longing or melancholy. When no one is looking, he will often hum softly to himself, lost in thought.

**Quirks:**
Mohamed has a few quirks that are not immediately apparent but become endearing over time. He has a habit of tapping his fingers on the counter when he's deep in thought, which Emily finds soothing. He also tends to collect small trinkets and tokens from around town, which he stores in a secret compartment in his apartment.

As Mohamed becomes more comfortable in his new life, these quirks become a part of his charm, endearing him even more to the people of Willow Creek.
