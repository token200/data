Since there is no fictional character named Mohamed García Márquez, I'll create a new character inspired by the real-life Gabriel García Márquez.

Meet Ahmed García Hernández:

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Age: Late 30s
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Warm brown with golden flecks, reminiscent of the rich soil found in Colombia's countryside.
- Hair: Dark chestnut locks that fall across his forehead, often slicked back to reveal a prominent nose and piercing eyes.
- Skin Tone: Olive-toned from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:** 
- Ahmed García Hernández is a creative soul with a deep love for storytelling. He has an infectious enthusiasm for life and a natural ability to connect with people from all walks of society.
- He's fiercely intelligent, able to effortlessly switch between complex theories and whimsical tales, making him both compelling and endearing in his interactions.

**Interests:**
- Ahmed is passionate about exploring the world around him. Whether traversing lush jungles or delving into urban slums, he's captivated by the stories hidden within these environments.
- A prolific writer himself, Ahmed also appreciates the art of music - often listening to traditional Colombian folk songs while working on his own writing projects.
- When not crafting stories, Ahmed loves sharing tales over warm cups of coffee or tea with those who are willing to listen.

This is a character loosely inspired by Gabriel García Márquez's own interests and personality traits.
