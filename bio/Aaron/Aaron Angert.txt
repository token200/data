Growing up as an outsider in his small town has made him feel disconnected from the people around him, but it has also taught him the value of self-reliance and perseverance. He is fiercely determined to follow his dreams, even if they seem impossible. Despite this, he is not rigid or unyielding; rather, he is open to new experiences and perspectives, as evidenced by his encounter with Sophia at the art gallery.

**Physical Attributes:** Aaron stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp features and expressive eyes. His eye color is a deep blue that seems almost piercing when he looks intensely at something or someone.

**Interests:** Aaron has a passion for literature, particularly the Romantics - William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Lord Byron. He finds solace in their themes of rebellion and individualism, which resonate deeply with his own feelings of disconnection and restlessness. In addition to reading, Aaron enjoys exploring his small town, wandering through its quaint streets, and observing the people around him. His encounter with Sophia at the art gallery also sparked a new interest in the arts, as he begins to see the world through the lens of beauty and creativity.
