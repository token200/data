**Personality:** Aaron is an enigmatic and introverted individual with a deep fascination for the mysterious and unknown. He has a vivid imagination and a passion for storytelling, often losing himself in tales of mythical creatures and forgotten spirits. As he delves deeper into his art, he becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the secrets of Central European folklore, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to tap into the unknown.

**Physical Attributes:** Aaron stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet wiry build. His eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait he inherited from his Hungarian heritage.

He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures in Budapest's hidden corners.

**Interests:** Aaron is deeply passionate about art, folklore, and the mystical aspects of Central European culture. As a child, he would spend hours exploring the narrow streets and alleys of old Budapest, searching for inspiration in the city's crumbling architecture and rusty ironwork. He has a special affinity for Hungarian mythology, particularly the stories of the Vukodlak and Lepusovik, which have become an integral part of his artistic expression.

As he grew older, Aaron's interests expanded to include occult studies, demonology, and forbidden knowledge from the region's mystical past. His discovery of the ancient tome hidden away in a dusty library marked a turning point in his life, unlocking a newfound creative potential that would forever change the course of his art.
