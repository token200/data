Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Aaron Renault:

**Personality:** Aaron Renault is a complex and guarded individual with a troubled past as a former hitman. He is haunted by his memories and struggles to shake off the feeling that his old life will catch up with him again. Despite this, he has developed a habit of being constantly aware of his surroundings, scanning for potential threats or unwanted attention. This paranoia stems from his years on the streets, where one misstep could mean death. He is resourceful and determined, having survived against all odds to reach his current hiding place.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Light brown, often messy and unkempt from years of neglect

Aaron's physical appearance reflects his rough-around-the-edges demeanor. His worn jeans and faded jacket are testaments to his years on the run, while his sun-baked complexion hints at his limited exposure to the outdoors.

**Interests:** Aaron Renault has a deep appreciation for nature and solitude. He finds solace in the quiet rhythms of small-town life, where he can blend into the background and avoid detection. In this context, he appreciates:

* Long walks through nature reserves or parks
* Reading books on various subjects to pass the time
* Playing guitar (he's an avid player and often hums while lost in thought)
* Exploring local cafes and towns, trying new foods and drinks

These interests provide Aaron with a semblance of normalcy and calm in his chaotic life. However, they also serve as a reminder that no matter how hard he tries to escape his past, it will always be there, lurking just beneath the surface.

As for who she is (the woman with piercing green eyes), her identity remains unknown for now, but Aaron's instincts are telling him that she might hold a connection to his troubled past.
