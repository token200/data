**Personality:** Aaron Ryota is a complex and introspective individual with a passion for art. He is consumed by his craft, often lost in his own world of colors and textures. Despite his reclusive nature, he is deeply emotional and sensitive, hiding a melancholic sadness beneath his confident exterior. Aaron is also someone who values solitude, but when confronted with the right person or work, he can be profoundly moved and inspired.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm) - Aaron appears to be of average height for an adult male.
* Eye Color: Deep blue-green (almost indigo) - This unique eye color hints at his artistic and introspective nature.
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and tousled from hours spent working in his studio. 
* Build: Slender and lean, with a wiry physique that allows him to move easily between his studio space.

**Interests:** Aaron's primary interest is art, specifically painting. He spends most of his days lost in the world of colors and textures on his canvas, exploring every hue and tone. His work speaks volumes about him, reflecting his emotions and inner world. When he meets Lily, his passion for art is reignited, but it also sparks a newfound desire to share his gift with others.

Aaron's interests are closely tied to his artistic pursuits, but one possible side interest could be music, as mentioned in the short story, "the soft scratch of the brush against the canvas" can be compared to the soothing sound of a piano.
