**Personality:** Aaron Petersen appears to be a complex individual with a mix of ruthlessness and vulnerability. As a former hitman, he has built a reputation as one of the most ruthless men in the business, but this is a facade that hides his own demons and insecurities. He struggles with feelings of guilt and anxiety, evident in his hesitation before answering Lena's phone call. Despite this, Aaron seems to be trying to move on from his past and start anew.
