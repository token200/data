Here's a summary of Aaron Szyma≈Ñska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Aaron stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, a piercing brown that seems to hold a world of depth behind them. He sports a scruffy beard, flecked with grey, which adds to his rugged, artistically-challenged demeanor.

**Personality:**
Aaron is a humble and introspective person, with a strong connection to his artistic vision. Despite his success in the art world, he remains grounded and unassuming, preferring to focus on his craft rather than seeking the spotlight. He's fiercely independent, valuing his alone time in the studio over social interactions. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a warm and generous spirit, evident when interacting with Sophie.

**Interests:**
Aaron is passionate about art, music (he plays the guitar), literature (especially Polish poets like Adam Mickiewicz), and philosophy. His love for colors, light, and texture drives his artistic expression, which often explores themes of nature, emotion, and human connection. He's also a history buff, particularly fascinated by the works of early 20th-century artists who experimented with modern techniques.

In addition to these interests, Aaron has a strong appreciation for coffee (he drinks it black), long walks in the countryside, and getting lost in the pages of a good book on art history or philosophy.
