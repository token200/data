He has a deep-seated obsession with power, ambition, and manipulation, which drives his actions and decisions. Aaron is fiercely intelligent and calculating, always weighing the risks and rewards of every situation. Despite his polished exterior, he harbors doubts and vulnerabilities, feeling trapped by his own destiny.

**Interests:** Aaron's interests are multifaceted and often contradictory. On the surface, he appears to be driven by a desire for power, prestige, and recognition. However, beneath this veneer lies a deep fascination with history, particularly ancient Rome and its infamous emperor Nero. He is drawn to the stories of ambition, manipulation, and ruthlessness that defined Nero's life and reign.

Aaron also has an affinity for the darker side of human nature, often exploring themes of obsession, addiction, and the blurred lines between good and evil.

He ponders the mysteries of human psychology, seeking answers to the existential questions that haunt him. His inner turmoil fuels his ambition, driving him to push boundaries and challenge those around him.

Aaron's contradictions – confidence and vulnerability, power and manipulation – are what make him both captivating and unnerving to others. They also underscore the complexity of his own psyche, hinting at a depth and richness that lies beneath his enigmatic surface.
