Here is a summary of the fictional character Dániel García:

**Physical Attributes:** Dániel stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing green eyes are his most distinctive feature, radiating a deep intensity and mystery. His chiseled features, including sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline, give him a rugged and brooding appearance that belies his complex inner life.

**Personality:** Dániel is a complex and multifaceted individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he presents himself as a tough and resilient individual who has learned to survive on the streets of New York City. However, beneath this armor lies a sensitive soul yearning for connection, love, and belonging. He is fiercely independent and guarded, having been left alone in an unknown city after his family vanished. Despite this, he has a deep passion for art, performance, and the thrill of taking risks.

**Interests:** Dániel's primary interests are aerial performances, acrobatics, and the creative expression that comes from them. He is also deeply passionate about art, particularly as it relates to Lena, the woman who becomes his partner and inspiration. His love for movement, performance, and self-expression drives him to push himself beyond limits, both in his physical pursuits and in his emotional life.

**Missing Details:** Given the lack of specific information about Dániel's past or his family, I have made some educated guesses based on his character profile. For example, it is possible that his parents were nomadic performers who traveled with the circus to find new inspiration for their acts. His fire-driven experience in the big top may have left him with emotional scars and a deep sense of abandonment.
