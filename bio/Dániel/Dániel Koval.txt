Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dániel Koval:

**Physical Attributes:** Dániel is a tall and slender man, likely standing at around 6'1" (185 cm), with an athletic yet refined build. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his pale face with a hint of stubble on his chin. His eyes are a deep, soulful brown that seem to hold a world of emotion, shining like warm, honey-colored lights in the dimly lit stages he performs on.

**Personality:** Dániel is a deeply passionate and expressive individual, driven by an insatiable love for music and life itself. He is fiercely creative and intuitive, with a unique ability to tap into the emotions of those around him through his playing. This sensitivity makes him both vulnerable and strong-willed, as he navigates the ups and downs of his personal life.

**Interests:** Dániel's primary interest is music – specifically jazz and improvisational forms. He spends most of his time honing his craft on the Fender Rhodes, exploring new sounds and techniques that allow him to express himself in ever-more profound ways. When not performing or practicing, he devotes himself to studying the greats (Miles, Coltrane, Monk) who inspired him as a child, seeking to learn from their genius and incorporate elements of their style into his own unique voice.

In addition to music, Dániel is drawn to the world of art and literature. He has a deep appreciation for the poetry of the 20th century (Ferlinghetti, Plath) and often finds himself lost in the pages of worn leather-bound books while sipping coffee at a local café.

Outside of these pursuits, Dániel's interests are more introspective: he is an avid observer of human nature, with a keen eye for detail that allows him to read people like characters in a novel. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect and support them – even if it means putting himself through pain and heartache once again.

Ultimately, Dániel's greatest interest lies in the emotional resonance of his music itself – how it can evoke feelings both deep and raw from his listeners. He sees himself as a conduit for this creative energy, channeling it into performances that leave a lasting impact on all who attend.
