Since there is no existing information on the fictional character Dániel Krūmiņš, I will create a brief summary based on my imagination.

Dániel Krūmiņš is a 28-year-old Latvian writer and poet, with an introverted yet creative personality. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender build and piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep understanding of the world's complexities. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face and strong jawline.

Dániel's interests revolve around literature, poetry, and philosophy, which he weaves into his own writing style. He has a deep love for the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Rimbaud, and Walt Whitman, which inspire his own explorations of existentialism, free verse, and the human condition.

As a writer, Dániel is drawn to the city's underbelly – the alleys, cafes, and markets where stories unfold in the margins. He finds inspiration in the quiet conversations, chance encounters, and forgotten tales that only reveal themselves when you least expect them. His poetry collections often reflect his fascination with the human condition, love, loss, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world.

In his free time, Dániel enjoys long walks along the Daugava River, listening to the sounds of the city's jazz clubs, and sipping coffee at quaint cafes, where he can indulge in deep conversations about literature, philosophy, and life's mysteries.
