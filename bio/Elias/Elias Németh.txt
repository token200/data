**Personality:** Elias appears to be a introspective and creative individual with a passion for photography. He is likely empathetic and understanding of people's stories, as evidenced by his ability to connect with others in the café despite feeling lost himself. His experience with loss (as hinted at by his grandmother's passing) has instilled in him a sense of melancholy, but also a drive to capture and convey the human experience through his art.

**Physical Attributes:** Elias is likely to be in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, given his age and level of maturity. He is described as sitting in a dimly lit café, which suggests he may not always be seeking attention or social interaction. Height and eye color are not explicitly mentioned, but based on the narrative tone and style, it's possible that Elias has an unassuming build (e.g., average height) and brown eyes.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Elias is drawn to capturing the beauty and grit of urban landscapes, with a focus on human stories and experiences. He appears to have a strong appreciation for history, particularly Budapest's rich history, which his grandmother taught him about. His passion for photography is not just about technical skill but also about conveying emotions and telling meaningful stories.
