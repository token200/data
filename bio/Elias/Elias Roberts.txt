This single-minded focus stems from his deep-seated desire to uncover the truth behind Lily's disappearance. Elias appears to be analytical and observant, as evident in his ability to re-interview witnesses and dig through old leads.

Despite his tough exterior, Elias's emotional vulnerability is hinted at through his mind replaying the last time he saw Lily and his subsequent reaction to the revelation about Victor being connected to her case.
