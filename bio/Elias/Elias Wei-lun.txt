Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Elias Wei-lun:

**Personality:** Elias is a reclusive individual with an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his isolated existence. He has developed a unique blend of detachment and fascination with the human experience, which allows him to absorb information like a sponge. Despite his reserved nature, he is drawn to the vibrant energy of the Grand Bazaar and is eager to connect with others who share his passion for knowledge.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, indicating a potential Asian or Mediterranean ancestry
* Hair Color: Jet-black, often kept neatly trimmed and styled in a modest manner
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, sharp jawline, and piercing nose

**Interests:** Elias is an avid collector of rare artifacts, dusty tomes, and unusual objects. He has spent years accumulating knowledge from books, manuscripts, and oral traditions, particularly those related to ancient languages, mysticism, and the occult. His fascination with the world beyond his estate drives him to explore various subjects, including philosophy, history, and art.

However, Elias's interests extend far beyond intellectual pursuits. He is deeply drawn to the sensory experiences of life, such as the tactile sensations of fabrics, pottery, and other textures, as well as the aromas and sounds of the bazaar. He finds solace in solitude but craves connection with others who share his passion for discovery.

Elias's interests also encompass a desire for spiritual or metaphysical understanding, which he senses might be connected to the mysterious wooden box handed to him by the vendor. His intentions remain unclear, leaving room for speculation about his motivations and future endeavors.
