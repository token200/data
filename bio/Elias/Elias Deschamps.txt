Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Elias Deschamps:

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - A tall and lean figure that allows him to navigate crowded spaces with ease.
- Eye Color: Piercing sapphires, indicating an icy blue hue that seems almost otherworldly due to their intensity and depth.

**Personality:** 
Elias is a master manipulator, able to disarm even the most hardened of souls with his enigmatic smile. His past is shrouded in mystery, leaving him as an elusive figure in the world of thieves. He possesses an air of confidence that allows him to command attention without seeking it.

**Interests:** 
While details about Elias's interests are sparse, it can be inferred that he derives great satisfaction from his craft – the art of deception and illusion-weaving. The thrill of the heist, combined with the intellectual challenge of outsmarting security measures and leaving behind a trail of confusion for those who did not share in his game, seems to be what drives him.

His past experiences as an alleged member of an elite thieves' guild or former soldier hint at a history deeply rooted in strategic thinking and cunning. However, these elements are kept under wraps, suggesting that Elias's true passions lie more in the realm of performance and the art itself, rather than the origins behind it.

It is also worth noting that his pseudonym "The Shadow Weaver" implies an affinity for weaving or manipulating fabric or threads – which could imply a deep connection to textiles, perhaps even as part of his disguise work, where he must seamlessly blend into different settings.
