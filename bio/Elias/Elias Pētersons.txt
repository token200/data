Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Elias Pētersons' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Elias Pētersons stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt, while his eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost grey in color when the light hits them just right. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely obtained during one of his more tumultuous adventures.

**Personality:** 
Elias is a complex individual with a mix of artistic expression and emotional turmoil. As a young man, he was known for his boldness and passion, qualities that made him stand out in the artistic community. However, this also led to him being labeled as "radical" and "rebellious," which ultimately resulted in him losing everything. Now, at 35, Elias is more introspective and guarded, carrying around a sense of shame and guilt from his past mistakes. He has a tendency to push people away, fearing that those close to him will be hurt by his demons. Despite this, he longs for human connection and creative expression.

**Interests:**
As an artist, Elias is deeply passionate about painting, with bold colors and haunting beauty being his signature style. He finds solace in the creative process, using art as a means of self-expression and catharsis. His interests also extend to music, literature, and philosophy, which he often explores during his quiet moments, seeking answers to life's deeper questions. Elias is drawn to places with rich history and cultural significance, like Riga, where he hopes to rediscover himself amidst the city's eerie silence.

Elias' background as a dishwasher, bartender, and street person has given him a unique perspective on human nature and resilience. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist at heart, often finding himself at odds with societal norms. His life experiences have taught him the value of perseverance, adaptability, and creative problem-solving.

The mysterious package with "Come back home" scrawled on it seems to stir something deep within Elias, hinting that his past may be more intertwined than he initially thought.
