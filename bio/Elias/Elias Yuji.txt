Here is a summary of the fictional character Elias Yuji:

**Physical Attributes:** Elias stands at 6'1" with an athletic yet lean build, hinting at his past as a special forces operative. His striking feature is his piercing green eyes, which seem to hold secrets and stories untold. He has chiseled features, including a sharp jawline that speaks of a life lived hard and fast.

**Personality:** Elias's past shrouded in mystery leaves little room for guesswork about his personality. However, it can be inferred that he is driven by a sense of guilt and purpose after leaving the military. He appears to be calculating and precise, with an unparalleled skillset as a mercenary. His reputation commands respect, if not fear, suggesting that he operates on the fringes of society.

**Interests:** As a former special forces operative turned mercenary, Elias's interests likely revolve around high-stakes missions and adventure. He has an affinity for navigating treacherous terrain and overcoming challenges. On a deeper level, however, his journey suggests that he is driven by a desire to right the wrongs of the world, particularly when it comes to those who wield power. His encounter with the artifact hints at an underlying sense of morality and responsibility.

It's worth noting that Elias's personality and interests are shaped by his past experiences as a special forces operative and mercenary. He is likely haunted by memories of his past missions, which have left him with a complex emotional landscape and a deep-seated desire for control over his own destiny.
