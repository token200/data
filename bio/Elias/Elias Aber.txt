Here's a summary of the fictional character Elias Aber:

**Personality:** Elias is a rugged and stoic individual with a sharp mind and a dry sense of humor. He has been hardened by his experiences as a former soldier, but still retains a glimmer of humanity beneath his gruff exterior. As a private investigator, he is driven by his instincts and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to take on cases that challenge the status quo. Elias is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a tendency to trust his gut over authority or convention.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue (a sharp contrast to Lila's piercing green eyes, which seem to match her sparkling personality)
* Hair: Dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that suggests he'd rather be focused on solving a case than worrying about his appearance.
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of military training and physical labor.

**Interests:** Elias is deeply passionate about uncovering the truth and bringing justice to those who have been wronged. He has a strong sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about. Outside of his work as a private investigator, Elias enjoys classic rock music, old movies, and drinking whiskey in quiet moments to himself.

As for his interests, Elias seems to be intrigued by the darker corners of society and is drawn to cases that involve corruption, power struggles, or high-stakes games. He has a fascination with puzzles and codes, which often helps him piece together seemingly unrelated clues.
