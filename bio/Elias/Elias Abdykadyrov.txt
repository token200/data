Based on the short story, here is a summary of Elias Abdykadyrov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elias appears to be a seasoned and resourceful individual, having spent time as a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist. He seems intelligent, quick-witted, and able to think on his feet, as evident from his expert disarming of attackers and deciphering of cryptic codes. However, he also seems cautious and wary, particularly when sensing that something is off about an assignment.

**Physical Attributes:** Elias's physical attributes are not fully described in the story, but based on his actions and reactions, it can be inferred that:

* He likely stands at around 5'10" to 6'0", given his ability to move quickly and easily among patrons.
* His eye color is not specified, but considering the contrast with his dark hair and potential affinity for mystery and deception, a blue or grayish-blue might be suitable.
* His hair color could range from dark brown to black, which suits his rugged profession as a former KGB agent.

**Interests:** Elias's primary interests appear to be:

* Investigating corruption within the Russian establishment
* Exposing truth through journalism and freelance reporting
* Combating danger and deception in his work as a journalist
* Building strong partnerships with like-minded individuals (as seen with Natalia)

These interests are likely driven by his past experiences as a KGB agent, where he was trained to identify and counter threats, and his present-day profession as a journalist, which requires him to seek out the truth and hold those in power accountable.
