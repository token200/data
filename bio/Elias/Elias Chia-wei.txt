**Personality:** Elias is an introverted yet passionate individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is deeply empathetic and has a strong desire to connect with others who share similar interests. His creative pursuits have taught him the value of patience, dedication, and perseverance, which he carries over into other aspects of his life.

**Physical Attributes:** Elias stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. He has dark brown eyes that sparkle with curiosity, and jet-black hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy swoop. His features are delicate yet expressive, giving him a strikingly handsome appearance that belies his introverted nature.

**Interests:** Elias's true passion lies in painting, which he explores through various mediums and styles.
