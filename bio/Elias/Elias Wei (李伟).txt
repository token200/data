Based on the short story, here is a summary of Elias Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elias is a driven and ambitious individual who has high expectations for himself. However, this drive can also make him feel suffocated under pressure. He is introspective and may struggle with self-doubt. Despite this, he values his intellect and ambition, but is beginning to realize the importance of nurturing other aspects of his personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Elias is likely in his mid-to-late 30s (35 years old at the time of the story). He has not been physically described in detail, but based on his profession as a software engineer, he may be slender or lean. His eye color is unknown, but given his East Asian background, it's possible that he has brown or black eyes.

**Interests:** Elias's interests appear to be centered around music, particularly jazz. He often finds solace in listening to Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" and values the calming effect it has on him. This hobby suggests that he may also appreciate other forms of art, such as literature (his sister Mei mentions taking care of their mother, implying a shared love of books) or possibly even creative pursuits like writing or painting.
