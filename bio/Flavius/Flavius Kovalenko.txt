**Physical Attributes:** Flavius stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his years of experience in espionage. His piercing blue eyes, which are described as "telling a thousand stories," are a striking feature that has caught the attention of those around him. His dark hair is typically slicked back, revealing a strong jawline and sharp facial features.

**Personality:** Flavius is a man of few words, preferring to observe and listen rather than speak. He is calculating and introspective, always weighing the risks and consequences of his actions. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and a desire for redemption, which drives him to make amends for past mistakes.

**Interests:** Flavius's interests are few, but significant.
