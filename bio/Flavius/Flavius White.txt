**Physical Attributes:** Flavius stands at 6'2" with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His jet-black hair has a tendency to darken as he ages, giving him an air of mystery and depth. He likely possesses a strong, athletic build from his years spent navigating the underworld of 1920s New York City.

**Personality:** Flavius exudes quiet confidence and carries an air of respectability that commands attention.

This introspection has led him to seek redemption through his work as a rare book conservator and dealer.

**Interests:** Flavius's interests revolve around literature, philosophy, and the power of language. He finds solace in the tangible world of books, particularly those that hold secrets and stories of the past. His love for rare texts has led him to become entangled in a web of cryptic symbols, hidden manuscripts, and underground archives.

**Hobbies:** As a bibliophile expert, Flavius likely enjoys reading, writing, and learning about various historical periods and cultures. He may also be drawn to puzzles, codes, and ciphers, given his involvement with the mysterious manuscript.

**Values:** For Flavius, the true value lies not in the books themselves but in the stories they tell. His journey is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about his past, find redemption, and perhaps leave behind the shadows that have haunted him for so long.
