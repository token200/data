However, Aria catches glimpses of piercing eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom and kindness.

**Personality:** Flavius exudes an air of mystery and charisma. He is a listener, preferring to absorb the stories and emotions of others rather than sharing his own experiences.

As Aria spends more time with him, she begins to sense a depth of empathy and understanding beneath his smoke-shrouded exterior.

**Interests:** Flavius is drawn to the tales of travelers who stumble upon his doorstep, listening intently to their stories and sharing ale and wisdom in return. He appears to be a collector of experiences, gathering fragments of people's lives like a historian collecting relics from forgotten eras. In his younger years, he may have been involved in the underworld or as a smuggler, but now, it seems that his interests lie more in the realm of listening and understanding.

Despite his reclusive nature, Flavius appears to be driven by a sense of justice and a desire to protect those who are vulnerable. His connection to Aria is more than just a chance encounter; he genuinely wants to help her navigate the dangers of Ashwood Guild, revealing a glimmer of humanity behind his smoke-shrouded mask.

**Habits:** Flavius's habits include sipping ale and listening to tales from travelers in his dimly lit warehouse. He often spends hours lost in thought, steepling his fingers together as he contemplates the stories shared with him. His enigmatic nature is maintained through the perpetual veil of smoke that shrouds his face, adding an air of mystery to every interaction.

Overall, Flavius Laine appears to be a complex and multifaceted individual, driven by a desire for understanding and connection in a world filled with danger and uncertainty.
