**Personality:** Bakhyt Novak is a ruggedly beautiful individual with a calm and collected demeanor. He possesses a deep understanding of the natural world and has a strong connection to the land and its creatures. His presence is soothing and reassuring, like a warm breeze on a summer's day. Despite his reserved nature, he has a sense of warmth and generosity that puts those around him at ease.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Bakhyt stands at an impressive 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a lean yet athletic build honed from years of riding horses across the steppes.

**Interests:** Bakhyt's primary interest lies in his traditional art of horsemanship and his deep connection to the natural world. He has spent countless years honing his skills as a rider, learning every rock, tree, and water source on his vast territory. He is also deeply knowledgeable about local customs and legends, passed down through generations of nomadic culture.

Beyond his love for the land and its creatures, Bakhyt enjoys simple pleasures like sharing meals with strangers, watching the stars at night, or listening to the songs of the steppes (the traditional instruments used by Kazakhstani musicians). He has a deep respect for tradition and is fiercely protective of his heritage.

It's worth noting that Bakhyt's interest in crystals is hinted at through his offering of the leather-wrapped crystal to the outsiders. This suggests that he may have an affinity for spiritual or mystical practices, although this aspect of his personality is not fully explored in the short story.
