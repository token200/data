Bakhyt has a way of connecting with people from all walks of life, and he's not afraid to immerse himself in different cultures and experiences.

He's also deeply empathetic and compassionate, able to understand the perspectives of others through his art. This quality earned him the respect and admiration of the nomadic tribes he encountered in Mongolia.
