**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)

**Personality:**

Bakhyt is a charismatic and confident individual who exudes a sense of calmness and authority. He has a strong sense of justice and will fiercely defend those he cares about. Despite his tough exterior, Bakhyt has a compassionate heart and a dry sense of humor that can be both disarming and endearing.

**Interests:**

Bakhyt is an avid traveler and has a deep passion for history, particularly the ancient civilizations of Central Asia. He's also an accomplished musician, playing the tar (a traditional Persian instrument) with great skill. When not exploring new places or jamming on his tar, Bakhyt can often be found devouring books on philosophy, psychology, or anthropology.
