**Personality:** Bakhyt is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Despite his artistic talent and success, he remains humble and grounded, preferring to let his work speak for itself rather than seeking the spotlight. He has a quiet confidence that commands attention, and his piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up from beneath.

**Interests:** Bakhyt is deeply passionate about photography, music, and art. He finds inspiration in the city's vibrant streets, eclectic music venues, and hidden corners of Budapest. He is drawn to the beauty in decay, the stories in abandoned buildings, and the secrets that lie just beyond the surface level of everyday life.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Bakhyt has a deep love for the night sky and the stars, often spending hours gazing up at the moon or lost in thought. He is also fascinated by the city's history, mythology, and folklore, which he believes informs much of his own art and worldview.
