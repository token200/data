Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Carlos Kalnins:

**Personality:** Carlos Kalnins appears to be an introspective and creative individual who values authenticity and nonconformity. He is passionate about art and music, and has a deep appreciation for abstract art and pushing boundaries in his own work. Carlos also seems to be someone who values meaningful connections with others, as he felt a strong connection to Maria's artwork and was drawn to her conversation.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide any information about Carlos' physical attributes beyond height and eye color. However, for the sake of completeness, let us imagine that Carlos stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to sparkle with creativity when he's in his element.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Carlos has a deep passion for art and music. He is likely an avid fan of concerts, festivals, and underground art galleries, where he can discover new and innovative works by local artists. In addition to art and music, Carlos seems to be interested in art theory and philosophy, as evidenced by his conversation with Maria about these topics.

It's worth noting that while we don't have a wealth of information about Carlos' personality, physical attributes, or interests beyond the short story, I've tried to fill in some gaps based on his character traits and actions.
