He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, which he maintains through regular exercise. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that seems out of place among his rough-around-the-edges demeanor.

**Personality:**
Lewandowski is a free thinker who operates on the fringes of society. He has a reputation for being unorthodox and unconventional, often challenging the status quo to uncover the truth. His sharp wit and quick thinking make him an asset in high-pressure situations, but also lead him to take risks that sometimes put him at odds with authority figures. Despite this, he is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to follow his own rules rather than adhering to traditional norms.

**Interests:**
As a former street artist turned detective, Lewandowski's interests lie at the intersection of art and crime.

**Additional Traits:**
Lewandowski has a dry sense of humor and a tendency to observe people without being observed himself. He has an intuitive sense of empathy, which allows him to connect with witnesses and suspects alike, often uncovering hidden motivations and alibis. His rough-around-the-edges demeanor serves as a shield, hiding his vulnerabilities beneath a tough exterior – but deep down, he is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to bring truth to the surface.
