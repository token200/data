Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Carlos Larsson:

**Personality:** Carlos is a introspective and emotional person who has been carrying around a lot of pain and anger from his past. He is determined to uncover the truth about his family's history and come to terms with his mother's death, which shows his resilience and willingness to face difficult emotions head-on. However, he also appears to be guarded and hesitant to open up to others, as evidenced by his initial reluctance to speak with Maria.

**Physical Attributes:** Carlos is not described in great detail in the short story, but based on the fact that he is referred to as "Cosmo" by Maria, it's possible that he may have Swedish heritage or a Scandinavian name. He appears to be of average build and stature, although his exact height is not specified.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, Carlos' eye color is not mentioned in the story, so I can only speculate based on typical Scandinavian characteristics - he may have blue or brown eyes, with darker hair common in Swedish culture.

**Interests:** Based on the context of the short story, it appears that Carlos is interested in learning about his family's history and uncovering the truth about his parents' divorce. He is also clearly emotional and sensitive to the legacy of his mother, indicating a strong connection to her memory and a desire to understand their complicated past.

Overall, Carlos seems like a complex and deeply feeling individual who has been shaped by his experiences and is now seeking closure and understanding through his journey back to Malm√∂ and his family's history.
