Carlos Balodis is a complex and enigmatic individual. He has a rebellious streak that stems from his childhood experiences in juvenile detention, where he learned to rely on himself rather than others. This self-reliance has become a defining characteristic of his personality, as he navigates the world with a sense of weightlessness and detachment.

He has a deep pain that he carries within himself, and this pain makes him intensely passionate and creative.

**Interests:**
Carlos has a deep passion for art, particularly painting. He is a skilled forger who can mimic the styles of master artists, but his true talent lies in creating works that are breathtakingly beautiful and almost otherworldly. In addition to art, Carlos is drawn to the unknown and the mysterious, often exploring abandoned buildings and hidden corners of the city. He has a fascination with the supernatural and the occult, which he expresses through his art.

The studio on Elm Street is not just a place where he creates art, but also a sanctuary that allows him to tap into the unknown. It's a space where he can let go of his past and explore the possibilities of the future.
