Here is a summary of Lea Molnár's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lea Molnár is a fierce and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. She is a rebel at heart, always looking for the truth and willing to take risks to expose it. Her fearless attitude and sharp instincts make her a formidable journalist, but also put her in harm's way. Despite this, she remains unapologetic and unwavering in her pursuit of the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Lea stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, which suggests that she is physically fit and agile. Her dark hair is often whipping in the wind, adding to her striking appearance. Her piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those around her, as if challenging them to reveal their secrets. She has a small nose ring, a subtle tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, and a sprinkle of freckles across her cheeks that add to her eclectic charm.

**Interests:** Lea is deeply passionate about investigative journalism, fueled by her desire for truth and justice. Her work takes her into the darker corners of Budapest's underbelly, where she uncovers corruption and exploitation. She has a particular interest in exposing the influence of foreign investors on local politics and economy. Outside of her work, Lea enjoys sipping coffee at street vendors, smoking cigarettes (though not currently), and walking along the Grand Canal to clear her mind.

It's worth noting that some details about Lea's life are left unexplored in the original short story. For example, it is unclear how old she is or what drove her to become a journalist in the first place. However, based on her personality, actions, and interests, we can infer that Lea is likely in her late 20s or early 30s, a young adult with years of experience reporting on corruption and injustice.
