Lea's creativity and confidence are contagious, inspiring those around her to take risks and pursue their own passions.

**Interests:** As a Cuban-American artist, Lea's interests are deeply rooted in her cultural heritage. She is fascinated by traditional techniques such as basket-weaving and ornate architecture, which she incorporates into her mixed media art practice. Her love for her community is evident in the lively street performers and bustling markets that populate Miami's Little Havana, and she often draws inspiration from these vibrant scenes.

Lea's artistic interests extend beyond her Cuban heritage, however, and she is also drawn to modern materials and techniques. She spends hours experimenting with different textures, colors, and combinations of traditional and modern art forms.
