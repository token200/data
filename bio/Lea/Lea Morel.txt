**Personality:**
Lea is a deeply introspective and emotionally complex individual. She has a strong connection to nature and the spirits that inhabit it, which guides her actions and decisions. Her experiences have left her with emotional scars, but she is determined to confront them head-on in order to restore balance to the land and heal herself.

**Physical Attributes:**
Lea stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall. Her long, raven-black hair cascades down her back in loose waves, often tied back in a ponytail. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, with piercing intensity that seems to hold secrets and wisdom. She has an athletic yet lean build, honed from years spent living off the land.

**Interests:**
Lea's primary interests revolve around healing, spirituality, and connecting with nature. As a member of an indigenous community, she was taught traditional healing practices by her grandmother, which have stayed with her throughout her life.

Lea's passion for healing extends beyond physical ailments; she is also drawn to emotional and spiritual well-being. She believes that true balance can only be achieved by addressing the interconnectedness of body, mind, and spirit, and she seeks to develop this understanding through her own experiences and connections with the natural world.
