**Personality:** 
Eveliis Vargas Llosa, or Lli for those close to him, is an unconventional thinker who has always followed his heart, even when it led away from the beaten path. He's fiercely independent and values artistic expression above all else, seeing beauty in every moment and every creation. Despite the pressure from his family and society at large to conform, he refused to be held back by expectations.

Lli is an out-of-the-box thinker who has formed strong bonds with fellow misfits – musicians, writers, and street artists who share his passion for pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons. His openness to chaos and experimentation led him to create a unique world of vibrant colors, textures, and sounds that reflected the raw energy of Lima's underground culture.

**Quirks:** 
- He has a habit of getting lost in his art, losing track of time and space as he becomes fully immersed in the creative process.
