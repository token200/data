Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Eveliis Bernard:

**Physical Attributes:**
Eveliis stands at 5'10" with an athletic yet slender build. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential clues. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night, often falling in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist and wears a silver watch with a leather strap that was given to her by her grandmother.

**Personality:**
Eveliis is a force to be reckoned with - driven, determined, and fiercely intelligent. Her piercing green eyes seem to hold secrets, but they also shine with a fierce inner light that commands respect. She has an unwavering sense of justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth, even if it means putting herself in harm's way. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate side that draws people to her.

**Interests:**
Eveliis is passionate about solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. She finds solace in the quiet moments of research and investigation, pouring over clues and evidence with a hawk's eye for detail. Her love of art and history also drives her - she's particularly fascinated by the works of Lucas Thompson, the famous artist whose disappearance she's been trying to solve.

Outside of work, Eveliis enjoys reading classic literature (she's an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes), practicing yoga to center herself, and listening to classical music to calm her nerves. She has a secret love for old movies and often finds herself quoting lines from her favorite films.
