**Personality:** Clément Tóth is an artistic and emotive individual with a passion that knows no bounds. He has a deep love for art and music, and his creative soul is drawn to new experiences and connections. Despite being described as having "bold" brushstrokes in the story, there is also an implicit suggestion of vulnerability and sensitivity within him, which is highlighted when he feels a connection to the violin.

In addition to these core interests, we can infer that Clément Tóth is also curious about the world around him, as evidenced by his chance discovery of La Belle Musique. This curiosity drives him to explore new experiences, such as playing the violin, which ultimately leads to a deeper understanding of himself and his artistic expression.
