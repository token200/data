However, beneath his exterior lies a complex mind filled with intrigue and curiosity. He is introspective and thoughtful, often lost in thought pondering the mysteries of existence and the workings of the human heart.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)

* Hair Color: Dark brown, often neatly combed and trimmed
* Build: Slender and lean, with an air of quiet confidence

**Interests:** Clément has an insatiable passion for knowledge and learning. He is an avid reader, devouring books on every subject imaginable, from philosophy to science fiction.
