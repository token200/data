Here is a summary of Thorbjorn Novak's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided story:

**Personality:** Thorbjorn Novak appears to be a curious and driven individual, with a passion for uncovering the unknown and unexplained. He is drawn to the darker corners of human psychology and has a strong desire to understand the human mind. Despite feeling uneasy in new environments, he seems confident and determined, as evidenced by his decision to settle into Ravenswood despite the locals' wariness. His enthusiasm and excitement about his research suggest that he is highly motivated and creative.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide a detailed description of Thorbjorn's physical appearance. However, based on his character traits and profession (a traveling writer), I would imagine him to be in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with a slender build and an energetic demeanor. His eyes are likely to be piercing and expressive, as if always scanning the surroundings for new inspiration.

**Interests:** Thorbjorn's interests are centered around writing, particularly in the realm of psychological thrillers and mysteries. He is fascinated by the darker corners of human psychology and believes that the key to unlocking the human mind lies in storytelling itself. His novel project explores these themes, drawing inspiration from the enigmatic residents of Ravenswood, such as Emily, Jasper, and The Stranger.

In terms of specific interests outside of writing, I would imagine Thorbjorn to be an avid reader, with a particular fondness for dusty tomes and books on ancient rituals, folklore, and mythology. He may also have an interest in local history, taxidermy (given his connection to Jasper), and the esoteric.

Overall, Thorbjorn Novak appears to be a complex and intriguing character, driven by a passion for storytelling and the unexplained, with a deep desire to understand the human condition.
