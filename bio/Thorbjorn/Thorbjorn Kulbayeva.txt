Despite the whispers and suspicions surrounding her, she maintains a calm and collected demeanor, neither confirming nor denying rumors about her past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green

* Nose Ring: Delicate silver ring adorns her small nose

**Interests:** While not explicitly stated in the original story, it can be inferred that Thorbjorn has a keen interest in economics and finance, given her profession as an accountant. She is likely analytical and detail-oriented, with a strong sense of justice. Her mysterious past may also suggest a fascination with history, culture, or international relations, although this remains speculative.

Additionally, Thorbjorn's reserved nature might imply that she enjoys quiet, introspective activities like reading, writing, or practicing yoga.
