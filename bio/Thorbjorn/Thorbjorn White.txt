Here's a summary of Thorbjorn White's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thorbjorn White is a complex and brooding individual with a dry sense of humor. He is fiercely independent and has a strong moral compass that drives him to protect the innocent and fight against corruption. As The Whispering Shadow, he is calculated and strategic in his approach, always weighing the risks and benefits before taking action. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity, stemming from his troubled past on the streets of New Haven.

**Physical Attributes:** Thorbjorn White stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in street fighting. His hair is dark brown and often messy, while his piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he encounters. He has a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which he obtained during one of his many battles against crime.

**Interests:** As an accountant by day, Thorbjorn White's interests lie in numbers and financial analysis. However, as The Whispering Shadow, he is fascinated by the world of espionage and surveillance. He spends countless hours studying tactics and strategies for infiltration, deception, and escape. He also has a keen interest in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, often incorporating these skills into his nocturnal exploits.

In addition to his love for justice, Thorbjorn White has a secret fascination with the occult and ancient mythology. The discovery of the Echo Stone sparked a curiosity about the mysterious artifact's origins and powers, which he continues to study in secret. This interest fuels his connection to the supernatural forces that fuel his own abilities as The Whispering Shadow.

In the shadows, Thorbjorn White seeks balance between his dual lives: the mundane world of accounting and the high-stakes realm of vigilantism. His greatest joy lies in the pursuit of justice, with no room for sentiment or weakness â€“ only the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of outsmarting his enemies.
