Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I have created a fictional character profile for Alfie Magi:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - Mae's slender yet athletic build allows her to move effortlessly through the forest.
* Eye Color: Emerald green - her eyes seem to sparkle with an otherworldly light, as if they hold a deep connection to the natural world.
* Hair: Long, curly brown locks that often escape her ponytail, giving her a whimsical and carefree appearance. Her hair is said to be infused with subtle strands of silver, which are rumored to have been woven by the forest spirits themselves.

**Personality:**

* Determined and courageous - Mae is not afraid to face challenges head-on, even when they seem insurmountable.
* Compassionate and empathetic - her connection to nature and its inhabitants allows her to sense the suffering of all living creatures.
* Gentle yet firm - Mae is not one to back down from a fight, but she also knows when to approach problems with patience and understanding.
* Loyal and protective - once you earn Mae's trust and friendship, she will fiercely defend and support you.

**Interests:**

* Nature and conservation - Mae spends most of her free time exploring the forest, learning about its various plants, animals, and ecosystems.
* Herbalism and healing - as a respected healer in her village, Mae is passionate about using natural remedies to help those in need.
* Spirituality and mysticism - her ability to communicate with spirits has led Mae down a path of self-discovery and exploration into the mysteries of the universe.
* Music and dance - when not busy tending to the forest or healing others, Mae loves to sing and dance under the stars, allowing herself to let go and connect with the world around her.

**Other notable traits:**

* Mae's name is often shortened to "Mae" by those who know her well, reflecting her down-to-earth and approachable personality.
* Despite her exceptional abilities, Mae remains humble and unassuming, never seeking to draw attention away from the natural world she so deeply loves.
* Her connection to nature has imbued Mae with a deep sense of wisdom, which she shares with others through her words, actions, and gentle guidance.
