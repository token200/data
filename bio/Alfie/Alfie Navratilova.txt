Based on the inspiration from Martina Navratilova's story, I've created a fictional character Alfie Navratilova with similar attributes:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Build: Athletic and toned

**Personality:**

* Alfie is known for his fiery personality, just like Martina Navratilova. He's confident, determined, and unapologetic in the face of adversity.
* Like Martina, Alfie has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to speak out against injustice or unfair treatment.
* Despite his bold nature, Alfie is also compassionate and empathetic, always willing to lend a listening ear to those who need it.

**Interests:**

* Tennis: Alfie's passion for tennis is just as intense as Martina's. He spends countless hours on the court, honing his skills and competing in local tournaments.
* Music: Alfie has a secret love for music, particularly punk rock and indie folk. In his free time, he enjoys attending concerts and playing guitar.
* Social Justice: Like Martina, Alfie is deeply committed to social justice and advocacy work. He's an active member of several organizations that support LGBTQ+ rights and other marginalized communities.

**Background:**

* Alfie was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, just like Martina Navratilova.
* His family moved to the United States when he was a teenager, where he grew up playing tennis and developing his passion for social justice.
* Alfie has always been driven by a desire to make a difference in the world, whether through his athletic pursuits or advocacy work.

Overall, Alfie Navratilova is a fictional character who embodies many of the same qualities that made Martina Navratilova an icon in tennis and beyond.
