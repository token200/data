He stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall and has piercing green eyes that seem to hold a deep intensity. His dark hair is flecked with threads of silver, hinting at a life of experience and introspection.

**Personality:** Alfie is a complex and enigmatic individual, shrouded in mystery. He is quiet and reserved, preferring to keep his thoughts and emotions to himself.

**Interests:** Alfie is passionate about baking and sharing his creations with the community. He takes great pride in crafting unique pastries using traditional family recipes, which has earned him a loyal following in Willow Creek. However, beyond the warmth of his bakery, little is known about his interests or hobbies outside of work. It's as if he's carefully compartmentalized aspects of himself, keeping them separate from his public persona.

Despite this, it's unclear what truth lies behind these rumors, leaving Alfie's motivations and true loyalties unknown.

**Hidden Qualities:** Despite his reserved nature, Alfie appears to have a deep emotional wellspring, which he only reveals in fleeting glimpses. His connection to his past is complex and possibly painful, leaving him with an unspoken vulnerability that draws others in. As Leo's visit suggests, there may be more to Alfie than meets the eye, hidden behind a fa√ßade of warmth and hospitality.
