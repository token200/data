Here's a summary of Alfie Borromeo's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alfie is an eccentric and unorthodox individual who approaches detective work with a self-proclaimed "amateur sleuth" attitude. He is known for being fiercely intelligent and having a knack for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. Despite his quirky nature, Alfie has a charming presence and can come across as humble and modest, often deflecting praise from his clients.

**Physical Attributes:** Alfie Borromeo stands at 5'8" with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and slightly unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that gives him a perpetually tousled look. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with curiosity whenever he's investigating a new case.

**Interests:** Alfie has a deep love for reading crime novels and watching true-crime documentaries, which likely fuels his fascination with the intricacies of human behavior and the psychology behind crimes. He is also an avid fan of prize fighting, often joking about being more likely to win a fight than solve a mystery (although he's proven himself to be quite adept at both). Outside of detective work, Alfie enjoys spending time outdoors, perhaps hiking or exploring the woods near Ravenswood.

**Additional Details:** Alfie has a distinctive tattoo on his left wrist, which reads "Cognitio" - a Latin term meaning "knowledge" or "understanding". He often wears a battered old fedora hat, which adds to his rugged and eccentric air. Despite his somewhat disheveled appearance, Alfie exudes an aura of confidence and intelligence that commands respect from those around him.
