Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Alfie Smith's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alfie is a driven and ambitious individual who has sacrificed personal relationships for success in his career. He is depicted as having a gruff demeanor and ruthless business tactics, but also shows a softer side when reminiscing about his childhood experiences with Mr. Patel. He is passionate about sustainability and waste management, and has a strong sense of duty to preserve the planet for future generations.

**Physical Attributes:** Alfie's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will assume an average height for a businessman in his mid-to-late 30s (around 5'9" or 175 cm). His eye color is also not specified, but based on the urban New York City setting and his business background, I would imagine him to have brown eyes.

**Interests:** Alfie's main interest lies in sustainability and waste management. As a director of operations for Green Earth Recycling Inc., he is deeply invested in the company's mission to reduce waste and promote recycling. He also has a strong connection to his childhood experiences, particularly with Mr. Patel, who taught him the value of reducing, reusing, and recycling. This connection fuels his passion for creating positive change in the world.

In addition to these interests, Alfie likely values business strategy, leadership, and problem-solving, given his role as director of operations and his experience working his way up the corporate ladder.
