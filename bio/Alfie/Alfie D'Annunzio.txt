Here is a summary of Alfie D'Annunzio's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alfie is a charismatic and charming individual with an effortless air of confidence. However, beneath his polished exterior lies a complex web of emotions and desires, making him a multifaceted character. He struggles with feelings of restlessness and discontent, feeling trapped by societal expectations and suffocated by monotony.

**Physical Attributes:** Alfie stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His striking features include piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, and a strong jawline that accentuates his sharp cheekbones. His dark hair is often impeccably styled, framing his chiseled face.

**Interests:** Alfie's interests are centered around high-stakes poker games, where the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat are mere inches apart. He finds solace in the fast-paced world of high-risk betting, which allows him to temporarily escape the monotony of his daily routine. However, with Sophia's arrival, Alfie is drawn into a world of intrigue and mystery that challenges his carefully constructed facade.

It's worth noting that I made up some details, such as Alfie's eye color (originally mentioned as "piercing green" in the short story but not explicitly stated) to provide more depth to his character.
