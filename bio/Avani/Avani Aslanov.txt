**Personality:** Avani is determined, independent, and fiercely self-reliant. Growing up with her father's notorious reputation has made her strong-willed and resourceful, but also guarded and cautious. Despite this, she has a strong sense of hope and optimism for the future. She is drawn to new experiences and people, and is willing to take risks to build a life that isn't defined by her family's dark legacy.

She has a small tattoo of a sun on her left ankle, a symbol of her desire for freedom and new beginnings.

She loves to paint and draw, and spends hours sketching the people and landscapes around her in Ashwood. She's also an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and self-help. As she builds a new life for herself, she hopes to use these creative outlets as a way to express herself and connect with others.
