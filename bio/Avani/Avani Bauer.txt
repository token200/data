**Physical Attributes:** Avani is a petite woman, standing at approximately 5'4" (162 cm) tall. Her hair is a rich brown color that falls down her back like a waterfall, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a bright shade of hazel, with flecks of green and gold that seem to sparkle with creativity. Her smile can light up a room, revealing a mischievous glint in her eye.

**Interests:** Avani's primary interest is painting, particularly landscape art. She finds inspiration in the natural world, often capturing the beauty of mountains, forests, lakes, and sunsets on canvas. Outside of her studio, Avani enjoys spending time outdoors, appreciating the simple things in life like a warm breeze, a good book, or a delicious meal prepared by herself (she's quite skilled at cooking!). She values solitude, finding comfort in the peacefulness of nature and the creative silence it provides.
