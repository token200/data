Carlo seems to be driven by a passion for art and the thrill of creating something that can deceive even the most discerning collectors.

**Physical Attributes:** Carlo is described as having:

* Eyes that "seem to hold a thousand midnights" - suggesting dark, piercing eyes with an almost supernatural intensity.
* A smile that could charm the birds from the trees - implying a warm, captivating smile.

It's worth noting that Carlo's interests may go beyond art forgery itself, as his conversation with Kuznetsov implies a deeper understanding of the art world and its collectors.
