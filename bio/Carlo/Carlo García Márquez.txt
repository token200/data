He's a introspective person who finds solace in his own thoughts and imagination, often getting lost in the pages of his notebooks and journals.

Background:
Carlo García Márquez was born in the picturesque town of Salento, Colombia, surrounded by lush green mountains and rolling hills. Growing up, he spent countless hours listening to his abuela's stories and legends, which sparked his imagination and fueled his passion for writing.

With a heart full of compassion and a mind full of wonder, Carlo continues to weave tales that transport readers to fantastical worlds filled with magic, love, and hope.
