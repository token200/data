**Personality:**

Carlo is a complex and driven individual. On the surface, he appears to be a no-nonsense detective with a sharp mind and a keen eye for detail. However, beneath this exterior lies a deeper sense of restlessness and longing. Carlo is haunted by a feeling that something is missing in his life, and he is constantly seeking justice not just as a duty, but also as a personal calling. This drives him to take risks and push boundaries, often putting himself in harm's way.

Despite his tough exterior, Carlo has a vulnerable side, particularly when it comes to those he cares about. He is fiercely loyal and protective of Sophie, his partner and friend, and will stop at nothing to keep her safe. However, this loyalty also makes him fiercely independent, willing to go it alone if necessary.

Carlo's interests are diverse and often centered around his work as a detective. He has a passion for history, particularly the history of Paris, which he knows intimately. This knowledge informs his approach to cases, allowing him to understand the cultural and social context in which crimes take place.

In addition to his love of history, Carlo is also fascinated by psychology and the human mind. He has a keen insight into the motivations and behaviors of others, which makes him an excellent interviewer and interrogator.

Outside of work, Carlo enjoys exploring the city and discovering new hidden gems. He is particularly fond of art, music, and literature, often spending hours in bookstores or galleries lost in thought.

However, his most driving interest is justice itself. Carlo believes that everyone deserves a fair shot at life, and he spends every waking moment searching for ways to bring wrongdoers to account. This pursuit of justice consumes him, even when the personal costs become too high.

Overall, Carlo Lefevre is a complex and driven individual with a unique blend of intellectual curiosity, emotional vulnerability, and dogged determination.
