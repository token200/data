However, beneath this polished exterior lies a deep-seated desire to understand his mysterious past and reconcile his identity. He is driven by curiosity and a need for truth, which often puts him at odds with his stardom and the expectations of those around him.

**Interests:**
Carlo's passions are deeply rooted in music, particularly classical music. His talent for violin has been his driving force throughout his life, often overshadowing other interests or emotions. Despite being an accomplished musician, Carlo seems to have lost touch with the genuine emotions that fueled his early performances. This disconnection from his art is reflected in his emotional turmoil as he unravels fragments of his family's history and confronts the dark secrets of his past.
