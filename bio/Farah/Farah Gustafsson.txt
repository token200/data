**Personality:** Farah is a free-spirited individual who has always struggled with conformity. She is passionate, determined, and unapologetic about following her artistic instincts.

* Eye Color: Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo blue, almost purple, which seems to sparkle with creativity and intensity.
* Other physical attributes: Farah's hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a paintbrush on her left wrist, symbolizing her artistic heritage.
