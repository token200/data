Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Farah Bauer:

**Personality:** Farah is a determined and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and has a tendency to push herself to the limit in pursuit of her goals. Her years as a detective have made her jaded and cynical at times, but she also has a deep-seated passion for uncovering the truth and helping those in need. Despite her tough exterior, Farah has a vulnerable side that she only reveals to those closest to her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Chestnut Brown
* Build: Athletic and toned, with a lean physique developed from years of regular exercise and a high-stress job.
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, sharp jawline, and piercing dark brown eyes that seem to bore into those she interrogates.

**Interests:** Farah is an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on true crime, psychology, and philosophy. She is also an expert in various martial arts disciplines and practices yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being. Her love of music is a rare indulgence for someone with such a serious occupation; she has been known to belt out show tunes from Broadway musicals while scrubbing away at evidence or working late shifts.

Farah's interests also include photography, where she enjoys capturing the city's gritty beauty and human stories that often get lost in the news cycle. Her own personal project is a photo essay on the lives of New York City's most forgotten residents, which she hopes to publish one day.
