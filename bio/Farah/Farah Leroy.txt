Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Farah Leroy's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Farah appears to be a introspective and creative person who has found solace in nature. After leaving behind the bright lights of Manhattan, she seems to have settled into a more laid-back and peaceful lifestyle in Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, where she can reconnect with her artistic side. She is also shown to be resilient and determined, having overcome personal struggles such as the loss of her parents.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, not much information is provided about Farah's physical appearance in the short story. However, I will make some educated guesses based on her character traits:

* **Height:** I would estimate that Farah is around 5'6" (168 cm) to 5'8" (173 cm), which seems proportional for a creative and artistic person.
* **Eye Color:** Given the nostalgic and introspective nature of the story, I imagine Farah's eyes to be a soothing shade, possibly blue or green. Perhaps a soft blue or mossy green would fit her character best.

**Interests:**

* Art: As an artist in the past, Farah still enjoys creating art, albeit with a break. Her passion for drawing and painting landscapes, portraits, and seascapes is evident.
* Nature: The sea and its rhythms seem to have a profound effect on Farah's life, and she finds peace in being surrounded by the ocean.
* Creativity: While her artistic side has been dormant for some time, the spark reignited when she picks up her pencils again suggests that creativity remains an essential part of her identity.

Overall, Farah Leroy appears to be a introspective and creative person who has found solace in nature and art.
