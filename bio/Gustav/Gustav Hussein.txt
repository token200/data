Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Gustav Hussein:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) - indicating an above-average height, possibly due to his years of athleticism in his spy days.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes, suggesting a sharpness and intensity that was characteristic of his professional life as a spy.

**Personality:**

Gus is a complex and introspective person, with a rich history of secrets and stories. He is initially guarded and resistant to opening up about his past, but as he shares fragments of it with Sarah, he begins to reveal a more vulnerable side. This suggests that Gus has a strong sense of loyalty and trust issues stemming from his years in the spy world.

As the story progresses, we see Gus gradually shed his burden of secrets and find redemption through sharing his experiences with Sarah. This implies that he is capable of empathy, self-awareness, and growth, making him a more nuanced and relatable character.

**Interests:**

While living on his farm, Gus likely enjoys the simple pleasures in life, such as tending to his land, working outdoors, and engaging in quiet reflection. He may also have an appreciation for solitude and isolation, having spent years away from civilian life, but this can be inferred more through his character's development rather than being explicitly stated.

In terms of personal interests, it is unclear what Gus enjoys doing outside of farming, but the fact that he begins to feel a sense of purpose and connection with Sarah suggests that he may have a passion for sharing his stories or helping others in some capacity.
