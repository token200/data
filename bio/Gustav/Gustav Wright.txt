Here is a summary of Gustav Wright's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Gustav Wright is a tall and lean individual, standing at 6'2" with a commanding presence. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up before revealing his thoughts. His dark brown hair is often slicked back, framing his angular face and highlighting the sharp angles of his cheekbones.

**Personality:**
Gustav Wright is a complex and multifaceted individual with a deep sense of vulnerability. Despite his tough exterior, he has a fragile emotional core that he guards fiercely. He is intensely passionate about music, using it as a means of expression and catharsis to cope with the trauma of his past. However, this passion can also make him withdrawn and introspective, causing him to push people away when they try to get close. As Sarah discovered during their interview, Gustav has a dry sense of humor and a wicked wit that he uses to deflect attention from his personal life.

**Interests:**
Gustav Wright is deeply rooted in the world of jazz music, with a particular affinity for classic blues and swing styles. He spends most of his free time honing his craft, practicing his saxophone playing until the wee hours of the morning. Music is not only his passion but also his escape from the memories that haunt him. When he's performing, Gustav becomes completely absorbed in the moment, allowing himself to let go of his emotional baggage and simply lose himself in the music.

Outside of music, Gustav Wright has a fascination with classic American literature and poetry, often finding solace in the words of Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg. He is also an avid fan of old-school cinema, particularly film noir classics that reflect the dark, gritty realism of his own experiences growing up on the streets of New York City.

Despite these interests, Gustav Wright's life remains shrouded in mystery, with only fragments of information about his personal life and motivations making it into the public eye.
