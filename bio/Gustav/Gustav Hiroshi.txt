**Physical Attributes:** Gustav is an elderly man in his late 60s, with a slender yet wiry build. He stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) tall, allowing him to move quickly and easily despite his age. His eyes are a warm, honey-brown color that seem to sparkle with intensity when he's discussing his botanical interests.

He has a deep sense of duty and responsibility, particularly towards those he cares about, such as his granddaughter Emiko. This determination and willingness to take risks make him a natural-born hero.

**Interests:** Gustav's primary passion is botany, with a focus on rare species and their unique properties. He spends years cultivating exotic orchids in his sprawling greenhouse on the outskirts of Tokyo. However, following the events at the stadium, his priorities shift towards helping others and using his knowledge to make a positive impact on his community. This newfound purpose brings a sense of fulfillment and joy to Gustav's life.

In addition to his botanical interests, Gustav appears to have a strong interest in chemistry, particularly fire chemistry, which proves invaluable during the fire at the stadium. His experience and expertise in this area allow him to make split-second decisions that help save countless lives.
