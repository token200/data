* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those he meets, conveying a sense of intensity and focus.
* Build: He has a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of being physically active in his line of work as a detective.

**Personality:**

* Gustav is a seasoned homicide detective with years of experience working in the meanest neighborhoods of Honolulu. This has likely made him toughened up and world-weary, but also deeply driven to solve cases.
* He exudes an air of detachment, scanning crowds with a practiced eye that misses nothing. This could be both a skill honed from experience and a defense mechanism against emotional attachment in his work.
* Despite this detachment, Gustav is fiercely committed to justice and has a strong sense of resolve when it comes to solving cases and bringing perpetrators to account.

**Interests:**

* His work as a detective is clearly his passion. Gustav throws himself fully into every case he works on, using his skills and experience to track down leads and unravel mysteries.
* Outside of work, there is little mentioned about Gustav's personal interests or hobbies. However, given his dedication to justice, it is possible that he might be involved in volunteer work or charity organizations focused on law enforcement or social causes.

**Additional Details:**

* It is worth noting that "Mac" seems to be an informal nickname used by those close to him (like Danno). This could suggest that Gustav has a more relaxed side, but also implies that this is not his professional name.
* The tropical setting of Honolulu might influence Gustav's perspective on life and crime, making him more attuned to the rhythms and cultures of the city. However, the overall tone of his personality suggests he remains above petty cultural or social biases.
