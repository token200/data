Based on the story about Leonard Maltin, I've created a fictional character profile for Leonard Mastroianni:

**Name:** Leonard Mastroianni
**Age:** Late 50s/Early 60s (though still energetic and enthusiastic)
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Bright blue

**Personality:** Leonard is a charming, affable man with a quick wit and a passion for cinema. He has a deep love for films that spans multiple decades and genres, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Despite being an expert in the field, he remains humble and approachable, making him a beloved figure among film enthusiasts.

**Interests:** Leonard's interests are centered around film history, analysis, and criticism. He is particularly fascinated by the works of classic Hollywood directors, foreign cinema, and the art of storytelling on screen. In his free time, he enjoys attending film festivals, visiting independent theaters, and engaging in discussions with fellow cinephiles.

**Physical attributes:** Leonard's bright blue eyes sparkle with excitement when discussing films, and his warm smile puts those around him at ease. His short, dark brown hair is often combed neatly to the side, accentuating his sharp jawline. He has a gentle, weathered complexion, which speaks to years of reading and researching in libraries and film archives.

**Additional details:** Leonard is an Italian-American, with a strong connection to his heritage. He grew up surrounded by family stories about his ancestors' experiences as immigrants in the United States. This rich cultural background informs his perspective on film history and allows him to bring a unique voice to his reviews and interviews.
