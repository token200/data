**Personality:** Despite his polished exterior, Stefano's past has left emotional scars. He remains fiercely loyal and protective of those who have supported him, but also struggles with vulnerability. His success in the art world has made him increasingly reserved, preferring to observe and listen rather than speak. However, when he feels safe enough, Stefano opens up with a dry wit and sharp intellect that can be both captivating and intimidating.

He has always been drawn to capturing the beauty in the world around him, particularly in the city of Paris where he grew up. In his work, Stefano seeks to reveal the hidden truths that lie beneath the surface of human experience, often focusing on themes of identity, belonging, and resilience.

As an artist, Stefano is deeply curious about the human condition and has a strong interest in exploring the intersections of culture, history, and social justice. He is known to be fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms through his work.

Outside of photography, Stefano enjoys reading philosophy, literature, and poetry, as well as practicing yoga and meditation to maintain balance in his life. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, always seeking to learn from others and grow as an artist and individual.
