He's fiercely intelligent, always looking to uncover new ingredients, techniques, and stories behind the dishes he tries. As a renowned food critic, Stefano is known for his exacting standards, but also has a soft spot for underdog restaurants and innovative chefs who dare to take risks.

**Interests:**

He's an avid sailor and enjoys spending time on the water, whether it's sailing through the Baltic Sea or simply relaxing with a glass of wine by the dock.

In addition to his love of food, Stefano is also fascinated by history, particularly the history of Sweden and its maritime heritage. He spends hours poring over dusty tomes in the National Library or attending lectures on Scandinavian folk art and culture.
