Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Amandine Thomas' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Amandine is a creative and sensitive person. She is an artist at heart, but since her grandmother's passing, she has lost her passion for painting. She appears to be introverted and might struggle with opening up to others about her feelings. However, with the support of her friends, particularly Marie, she begins to confront her emotions and find her way again.

**Physical Attributes:** Amandine is likely in her early twenties, but the exact age isn't specified in the story. She has curly brown hair (presumably inherited from her grandmother). Her eye color is green or hazel, which could be a unique feature of her family's heritage. As for her height, it's not mentioned in the story, so we can only speculate that she's average to slightly above-average height.

**Interests:** Amandine's primary interest is art, specifically painting and creating. She has always been passionate about art, encouraged by her grandmother, Grandma Madeleine. Before her grandmother's passing, Amandine found solace in painting, but the loss of her grandmother disrupted this connection. When she's with friends or engaged in creative activities, however, she begins to regain her passion for art.

Additionally, it can be inferred that Amandine values close relationships and emotional support from those around her. Her friendship with Marie is particularly significant, as Marie provides comfort and guidance during a difficult time in Amandine's life.
