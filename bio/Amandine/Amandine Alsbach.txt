**Personality:**

Amandine Alsbach is a brilliant and reclusive individual with an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of the universe. She is driven by a desire to uncover secrets and push the boundaries of human knowledge. Her determination and sharp mind have earned her numerous accolades, but also made her somewhat isolated from the world around her.

As she delves deeper into her research, Amandine becomes increasingly focused on her work, often neglecting her personal life and relationships in pursuit of her goals. This intensity is matched by a sense of detachment and aloofness, which can make it difficult for others to connect with her. Despite this, Amandine remains deeply committed to her craft and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth.

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Black
* Age: Late 30s/Early 40s (exact age unknown)
* Build: Thin, with a lean and wiry physique that belies her intense intellectual focus.

**Interests:**

Amandine's passion for astrophysics is all-consuming. She spends most of her time studying the behavior of celestial bodies, searching for patterns and anomalies in the universe. Her work is fueled by a desire to understand the underlying mechanisms of the cosmos, and she is willing to go to great lengths to achieve this goal.

In addition to her research, Amandine has a deep fascination with ancient mythology and folklore, particularly stories about cosmic observers and otherworldly entities like The Watcher. She sees parallels between these legends and her own findings, and believes that there may be more to the universe than we currently understand.

When not working in her laboratory, Amandine enjoys solitary activities such as stargazing, reading, and meditating. She finds solace in the quiet, dark vastness of space, where she can feel a sense of connection to something greater than herself.
