Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Robert Liebad:

**Personality:**
Robert is a complex individual who has been shaped by his unique circumstances. He is introverted and private, having withdrawn from the world after discovering his abilities. Despite this, he is fiercely independent and determined to control his own destiny. As he navigates the challenges of his situation, Robert demonstrates resilience, resourcefulness, and a strong sense of justice.

**Physical Attributes:**
Robert appears to be in his mid-twenties, with an average build. His height is around 5'10" (178 cm), making him slightly above average for his age group. He has brown eyes that seem to hold a depth of understanding, given the weight of his experiences. The accident and subsequent isolation have left physical scars on his body, including bruises and scratches.

**Interests:**
As Robert navigates his new reality, he becomes increasingly interested in exploring the limits of his powers and understanding the motivations behind the government's research. He is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about his abilities and their implications for humanity. On a personal level, Robert values his relationships with those around him, particularly Alex, who has remained a trusted friend and ally despite the turmoil he has endured.

However, as a character, Robert is not without his idiosyncrasies. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. This reserve serves as a protective mechanism, allowing him to keep people at arm's length while he figures out how to navigate this new world.

In his quieter moments, Robert is drawn to the quiet, mundane aspects of life â€“ like a favorite coffee shop or a long walk through the city streets. These simple pleasures serve as reminders that there is still beauty and humanity in a world that seems determined to exploit his abilities for its own purposes.
