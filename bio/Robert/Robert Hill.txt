**Physical Attributes:** Robert Hill is approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his rugged lifestyle. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing a face that is both weathered and heartbroken. His eyes are a deep, soulful brown that seem to hold a world of emotions within them. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got in a bar fight when he was younger.

**Personality:** Robert Hill is a complex and enigmatic individual, with a personality that is both tough and vulnerable. On the surface, he appears to be a loner who has given up on life, content to wander the streets and play his guitar for spare change. However, as he opens up to Emma, it becomes clear that there is more to him than meets the eye. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a deep sense of resentment towards the world that has treated him so harshly. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand.

He plays the guitar with a raw, emotional intensity that pours out onto the street corners and park benches where he performs. He is deeply passionate about his craft, pouring his heart and soul into every note. Outside of music, Robert is also an avid camper and outdoorsman, finding solace in the wilderness and the company of nature.

As his relationship with Emma deepens, it becomes clear that Robert is also interested in art and creativity, as well as storytelling and poetry. He sees Emma's struggles as a reflection of his own and is drawn to her raw talent and passion for life.
