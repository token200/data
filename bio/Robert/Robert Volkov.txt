I'd be happy to create a character profile for Robert Volkov from scratch. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of auburn
* Body Type: Athletic build, toned muscles

**Personality:**

Robert Volkov is a charismatic and confident individual. He has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about. However, his past experiences have left him with a deep-seated mistrust for authority figures, making him wary of getting too close to people in positions of power.

**Interests:**

Robert Volkov is an avid reader of history books, particularly those on military tactics and strategy. He's also a skilled fighter and martial artist, enjoying the physical and mental challenge of staying one step ahead of his opponents. In his free time, he enjoys practicing photography and exploring the great outdoors.

Here's a brief backstory for Robert Volkov: born in Moscow, Russia to a family of diplomats, Robert was raised in a culture of intrigue and deception. He learned early on how to navigate complex situations and think on his feet. As he grew older, he became increasingly disillusioned with the politics and corruption that seemed to permeate every level of society. Now, he travels the world as a freelance security consultant, using his skills to help those in need while avoiding the authorities himself.

Let me know if you'd like me to continue developing Robert Volkov's story or if you have any other requests!
