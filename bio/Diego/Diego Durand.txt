Here is a summary of the fictional character Diego Durand:

**Physical Attributes:** Diego Durand stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in high-stakes heists. His hair is dark brown and usually styled in a messy, tousled fashion, while his eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to gleam with mischief. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many escapades.

**Personality:** Diego Durand is a complex and enigmatic individual, driven by a combination of motivations both noble and nefarious. On the surface, he appears charming and confident, able to effortlessly charm his way out of sticky situations. However, beneath this facade lies a sharp mind and quick wit, honed from years of survival on the streets. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a strong sense of justice that drives him to take risks and push boundaries.

**Interests:** Diego Durand's interests are largely centered around his work as a thief, but he also has a deep appreciation for art, history, and architecture. He is particularly drawn to rare and valuable artifacts, and has a keen eye for spotting hidden gems and valuable treasures. When not planning or executing heists, Diego enjoys exploring the city's underbelly, visiting its lesser-known museums, galleries, and street markets.

**Other Traits:** Diego Durand is haunted by his past, having lost loved ones to the very people who wronged him. This drive for revenge fuels much of his work as a thief, as he sees himself as an agent of justice in a world that often seems stacked against those who are already vulnerable. He is fiercely loyal to his crew and associates, and will stop at nothing to protect them from harm.

Overall, Diego Durand is a charismatic and resourceful individual with a complex and nuanced personality, driven by both personal motivations and a desire for justice.
