Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Diego Dąbrowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Diego appears to be introspective, emotive, and possibly struggling with anxiety or depression, as indicated by his feeling of suffocation in Warsaw and his need for escape. He also seems to be deeply emotional, as evidenced by the guilt he feels for leaving without notice and the intensity of his emotions when meeting Marta again. His ability to write heartfelt confessions suggests that he is self-aware, vulnerable, and perhaps a bit sensitive.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide specific details about Diego's physical attributes, such as height or eye color. However, based on the context, we can infer that he is likely of Polish descent (given his surname "Dąbrowski"), which might suggest a more rugged or earthy appearance.

**Interests:** It is unclear what Diego's specific interests are, but it can be inferred that he:

* Enjoys nature: The story mentions him visiting Lake Zbrzeź and feeling a sense of freedom while driving through the night.
* Values solitude: He leaves Warsaw without notice and spends two days wandering around the city before meeting Marta at Lake Zbrzeź.
* Has a strong emotional connection to his past: His memories of his childhood, illness, and relationship with Marta are vividly present in his mind, suggesting that he has a deep attachment to these experiences.

It is also possible that Diego's interests include art or literature, given the presence of postcards and the lyrical nature of his confessions. However, without further information, it is difficult to make more specific claims about his interests.
