Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Diego Szabo:

**Personality:** Diego Szabo is a man with an unyielding dedication to justice. He is a seasoned veteran of the police force who has evolved from an idealistic young officer into a master sleuth. His sharp mind and keen instincts have earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking on cases that others may deem too difficult or unconventional. Szabo's passion for justice drives him to protect those in need and fight against the forces of darkness.

**Physical Attributes:** Diego Szabo is a tall and lean man, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a wiry build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he encounters, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. His dark hair is always impeccably styled, framing his chiseled features and angular face. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly violent case.

**Interests:** Szabo's primary interest is in solving the most puzzling crimes in Budapest. He is driven by a sense of justice and a desire to protect those who have been wronged. Outside of his work as a detective, Szabo enjoys reading classical literature and philosophy, often seeking inspiration for his cases in the works of great thinkers. He also has a passion for collecting rare books and artifacts related to Budapest's history.

It is worth noting that some details about Szabo's personal life are not mentioned in the original story, so I had to make some assumptions based on common detective character archetypes. However, these attributes should provide a solid foundation for further development of Diego Szabo as a fictional character.
