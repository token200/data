**Physical Attributes:** Karl Jasinska is a tall and imposing figure, standing at 6'2" with an athletic build that speaks to his years of physical labor. His piercing green eyes are almond-shaped and seem to gleam with intensity in the right light. His dark hair is often slightly unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges persona. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly harrowing case.

Karl also has a deep appreciation for technology and uses his skills to stay ahead of the curve in terms of forensic analysis and investigative techniques. He is well-versed in multiple languages and has a particular interest in cryptography and coding.

In his free time, Karl enjoys taking long walks along the city's waterfront and reading about historical cases that have gone cold. He has a small collection of rare books on criminology and forensic science, which he treasures almost as much as his badge.
