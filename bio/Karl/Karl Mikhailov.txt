Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Karl Mikhailov:

**Physical Attributes:** Karl stands at an imposing height, likely around 6'4" (193 cm), with broad shoulders and chiseled features that make him appear almost impenetrable. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, sizing them up for some unknown purpose.

**Personality:** Karl's past is shrouded in mystery, but his skills as a master thief and forger suggest a calculating and analytical mind. He appears to be driven by a sense of satisfaction and pride in his work, taking on high-stakes targets with ease. Despite this, he seems to have a hint of vulnerability and introspection, hinted at when he hesitates before agreeing to Petrov's deal.

**Interests:** As a master thief and forger, Karl's primary interest lies in acquiring rare and valuable items, particularly those that grant their owners immense power and influence. His skills suggest a fascination with the finer details of art, antiques, and luxury goods. He also appears to be drawn to puzzles and challenges, taking on high-security targets as a test of his abilities.

It's worth noting that Karl's interests may extend beyond material possessions, given the sense of unease he experiences after the encounter with Petrov. This could suggest that he is beginning to question the purpose of his life and the value of his skills, leading to a potential shift in his motivations or goals.
