Karl Ozola appears to be a calculating and resourceful individual with a strong sense of self-preservation. He has a natural ability to read people and situations, as evident from his skill in detecting deception during the meeting with Natalia.

Despite his tough exterior, Karl is highly intelligent and strategic, always thinking several steps ahead of his adversaries. He is also fiercely independent and determined to protect his new life, which he has built in the West. This sense of determination and self-preservation often leads him to take calculated risks, as seen when he accepts the mysterious invitation from Natalia.
