Based on the short story, here's a summary of Liam Altmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liam appears to be a laid-back and understanding individual who values his friendship with Emily. He is willing to wait for her and is patient when she runs late. This suggests that he is empathetic and caring towards those close to him. Additionally, his chuckle and good-natured response to Emily's tardiness imply that he has a sense of humor and can laugh at himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide specific details on Liam's height, eye color, or other physical attributes beyond mentioning that Emily noticed "the subtle lines etched into her forehead." However, I can fill in some missing details. Let's assume:

* Height: Liam stands around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a warm, hazel brown that seem to sparkle with amusement when he laughs.
* Hair Color/Style: Liam has short, dark hair that is often perfectly messy, giving him a slightly rumpled look.

**Interests:** Based on the conversation with Emily in the caf√©, it's clear that Liam enjoys:

* Sustainability and environmental issues (as evident from his work on sustainable energy campaigns).
* Traveling and exploring new places.
* Reading and discussing books with friends.
* Spending quality time with close friends, like Emily.
* Planning adventures and making memories with those he cares about.

Overall, Liam appears to be a well-rounded individual who values friendship, personal growth, and making the most of life's experiences.
