Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Liam Pedersen:

**Personality:** Liam is a determined and driven individual who is not afraid to challenge the status quo. He has a strong sense of justice and is willing to take risks to uncover the truth. As a journalist, he has spent years investigating corruption and deceit, which has likely made him fiercely independent and analytical. Despite his tough exterior, there is a glimmer of hope in his eyes that suggests he is also compassionate and empathetic towards those affected by the injustices he seeks to expose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue (not green, as mentioned earlier; I assume this was an error in the original story)

**Interests:** Liam's primary interest is investigating corruption and deceit in high places. As a journalist, he has a passion for uncovering hidden truths and shedding light on injustices. He is also drawn to puzzles and mysteries, which suggests that he values intellectual challenges and problem-solving. His interest in Ravenswood and its dark past indicates that he has a fascination with history and the secrets that lie beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary towns.

It's worth noting that some details about Liam's personality, physical attributes, and interests were not explicitly stated in the original story, so I have made educated guesses based on his actions and behavior.
