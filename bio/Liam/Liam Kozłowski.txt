Based on the short story, here is a summary of Liam Koz≈Çowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liam appears to be a no-nonsense, resourceful, and determined individual. As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of cases and has developed a keen instinct for detecting clues. He also seems to be fiercely loyal to those he trusts, as evident in his decision to take on Alex's case. Despite the eerie feeling that someone is watching him, Liam remains calm and focused, suggesting that he has a strong sense of self-preservation.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, we can infer the following physical attributes:

* Height: Unspecified, but possibly around 5'10" or 6'0", given his ability to walk through puddles without issue.
* Eye Color: Brown or dark brown eyes, as they are described in detail during his interactions with Alex.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Liam's primary interest is solving cases and uncovering the truth. However, beyond this professional drive, it seems that he might have a personal interest in social justice or helping those in need, given his willingness to take on Lena's case without being paid (at least initially). Additionally, Liam appears to be curious about puzzles and codes, as evident in his reaction to finding the torn piece of fabric caught in the rusty old lock.

It's worth noting that these attributes are not explicitly stated in the story but can be inferred from the context and events.
