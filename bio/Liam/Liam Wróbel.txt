Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Liam Wróbel:

**Personality:** Liam is an enigmatic figure with a rugged exterior and hidden vulnerabilities. He is introverted and has been hurt in his past experiences, leading him to build walls around himself. However, once you gain his trust, he reveals fragments of his past and shows a deep passion for innovation and finding beauty in brokenness. Despite his aloof nature, Liam is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to live life on his own terms.

**Physical Attributes:** Liam Wróbel is a tall and lean individual with an athletic build. He stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) and has piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rugged charm. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, hinting at the rough past he keeps hidden.

**Interests:** Liam's true passion lies in machinery and innovation, particularly in repurposing discarded parts into functional works of art. He is fascinated by the process of taking something broken and making it whole again, finding beauty in the imperfections and flaws that others might see as defects. His workshop is a testament to this philosophy, where he spends his days tinkering with engines, aircraft, and other complex machines. When not working on a new project, Liam enjoys spending time in nature, surrounded by the woods and trees that have become his sanctuary.

Despite his interests, Liam's past experiences have left him wary of getting too close to others or investing too much emotional energy into relationships. However, with Sarah's arrival, he begins to open up and share parts of himself, revealing a more vulnerable side beneath his tough exterior.
