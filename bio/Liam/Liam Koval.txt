Here's a summary of Liam Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liam is a determined and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. As a freelance journalist, he has developed a thick skin and is not afraid to take risks in pursuit of the truth. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else, which sometimes leads him to walk alone and avoid drawing attention to himself. Despite this, he has a strong sense of empathy for those who are marginalized or oppressed, which motivates him to tell stories that need to be told.

**Physical Attributes:** Liam stands at 5'10" with an athletic build, honed from years of navigating the streets of Los Angeles on foot. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, and his piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential leads. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a run-in with a local gangster while researching a story. Liam's style is understated yet functional, often favoring worn jeans, faded band t-shirts, and scuffed-up sneakers that have seen their fair share of adventures.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Liam is passionate about uncovering the truth and exposing corruption and injustice in all its forms. He has a particular interest in politics, economics, and social justice issues, often finding himself at the forefront of investigations into government scandals and corporate malfeasance. In his free time, Liam enjoys reading classic literature, listening to punk rock music, and practicing yoga to keep his mind and body grounded. He is also an avid hiker and loves exploring the wilderness areas surrounding Los Angeles, where he can clear his head and find inspiration for his next story.
