Personality:
Liam is a complex individual with a mix of determination and despair. As a young man who had grown up in Ashwood, he was once driven by the desire to make his grandfather's hardware store successful. However, after his parents' passing, Liam felt overwhelmed with responsibility, and this led him to drift through life without a clear direction. His experience with Emily showed him that he needed more from life than just living day-to-day in a small town.

Despite feeling restless and struggling to find meaning in Ashwood, Liam is fiercely determined to try again. This time around, however, his motivations are different - he is not driven solely by responsibility but also by the need for fulfillment and happiness.

Interests:
Liam has a range of interests that reflect both his love of nature and his creative side. His love of exploration, whether it be the woods behind his grandparents' house or the vastness of the city, suggests an adventurous and spontaneous individual. He is also drawn to history, as evidenced by his desire to learn more about Ashwood's past through its people.

Additionally, Liam has a passion for writing, which he keeps mostly to himself. His introspective nature makes him a natural at expressing emotions through words and poetry, reflecting a creative side that he may have kept hidden during his time in the city.
