**Personality:** Thérèse is a curious and introspective person with a heart full of wonder. She has a passion for learning and is drawn to the unknown, often feeling an affinity for secrets and hidden knowledge. Her skepticism about local legends gives way to a deep-seated desire to uncover the truth, making her a determined and driven individual.

**Physical Attributes:** Thérèse stands at around 5'7" (170 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with curiosity when she's interested in something. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a neat ponytail, revealing her heart-shaped face and smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Interests:** Thérèse has a particular fascination with mythology, folklore, and history, spending most of her free time reading about these subjects. She works as a rare book conservator at the Amsterdam University Library, where she surrounds herself with dusty tomes and forgotten knowledge. Her latest obsession is the legend of the Weesperpoort, a supposedly cursed well that is said to grant wishes to those who drink from it. Thérèse is drawn to this story because of its promise of hidden secrets and lost knowledge.
