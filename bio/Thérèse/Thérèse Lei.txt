Thérèse is a resilient and determined individual with a strong sense of courage and adaptability. Her upbringing by her mother from Taiwan and experience living in Hong Kong have shaped her into someone who is caught between two worlds but has learned to navigate this liminality with strength and resilience.

* Eye Color: Her eyes are likely a deep shade of brown, as the story describes her gazing out at the city "with the moon cast[ing] a silver glow on the waves below," which may indicate her eye color is darker than blue or green.

**Interests:**
Thérèse's interests seem to revolve around:

1. **Heritage and culture**: She has a deep appreciation for her Taiwanese heritage, having grown up listening to stories of adventure and resilience from her abuela.
2. **Travel and exploration**: Thérèse is drawn to the idea of leaving behind what she knows and embracing new experiences, as evident in her decision to leave Hong Kong.
3. **Food and cooking**: She enjoys traditional Taiwanese meals with her mother and has even owned a small café where friends gathered to share food and drinks.

These interests seem to be closely tied to Thérèse's sense of identity and belonging, reflecting her dual heritage and desire for self-discovery.
