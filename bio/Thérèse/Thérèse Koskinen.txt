Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Thérèse Koskinen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Thérèse stands at 5'7" with an unassuming presence. Her eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, a trait that has often been described as unsettling by those who don't know her. Her dark hair is typically pulled back into a neat bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Personality:**
Thérèse is a contemplative and introspective individual, with a deep love for knowledge and understanding. She has an innate sense of curiosity, often finding herself drawn to the unknown and unexplained. Despite being an outsider in her social circle, Thérèse is fiercely independent and comfortable with solitude, preferring the quiet company of books and her own thoughts.

**Interests:**
Thérèse's fascination with the supernatural and spiritual realms began at a young age. She has always been drawn to texts on mediumship, mysticism, and the occult. Her favorite authors include Helena Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, and Emily Dickinson, whose poetry often resonates with her own thoughts on death and the afterlife.

Thérèse's interests extend beyond literature, however. She is an avid researcher into various spiritual practices, including séances, spirit communication, and cosmic forces. Her journals are filled with notes on these topics, as well as her own personal experiences attempting to connect with the unknown.

As a seeker of truth, Thérèse remains committed to exploring the mysteries of life and death. Her apartment is a testament to this dedication, with shelves upon shelves of dusty books, artifacts, and trinkets collected from her travels and experiments.
