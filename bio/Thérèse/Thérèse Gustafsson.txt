Here is a summary of Thérèse Gustafsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Thérèse stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, while her eyes are an striking shade of deep blue that seems to hold a world of emotion within them.

**Personality:**
Thérèse is a deeply introspective and creative individual, driven by a passion for art that spans most areas of her life. Her experiences with Hyperthymesia have taught her the value of memory and the importance of holding onto the past, even when it feels like a burden. Despite this, she remains resilient and determined to make the most of her unique perspective on life. Thérèse is fiercely independent and values her alone time, often finding solace in her studio where she can lose herself in her art.

**Interests:**
Thérèse's interests are deeply rooted in her love of art, history, and storytelling. She has a fascination with the intersection of Swedish culture and mysticism, particularly when it comes to forgotten stories and legends. Her work often explores themes of melancholy, nostalgia, and the human experience, reflecting her own struggles with Hyperthymesia.

When not lost in her studio, Thérèse can be found wandering through Stockholm's winter landscapes, gazing up at the snow-covered rooftops that have long inspired her art. She is also an avid collector of antique books and artifacts, often scouring flea markets and vintage shops for rare finds that hold secrets to Sweden's rich history.

In recent years, Thérèse has become increasingly drawn to researching the mysterious village described in the letter she received, pouring over old texts and speaking with local experts in search of clues about its existence. Her passion for uncovering this hidden piece of Swedish history is now rivaled only by her desire to create art that captures its essence, infusing her paintings with a sense of wonder and enchantment that has long eluded her work.
