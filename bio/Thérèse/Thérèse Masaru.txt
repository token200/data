**Physical Attributes:**
Thérèse is a petite woman, standing at approximately 5'2" (157 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, expressive shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a world of emotions within them.

Despite this, Thérèse is a determined individual who values self-expression and authenticity. She's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms and expectations to forge her own path. When she finds something she loves or believes in, she throws herself wholeheartedly into it, which can be both inspiring and exhausting for those around her.

Her love for art is complemented by a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors. Thérèse is often lost in thought when contemplating the mysteries of the universe or simply watching the beauty of the natural world unfold before her eyes. Her experiences with anxiety and uncertainty have led her to explore mindfulness, meditation, and other holistic practices to find balance and inner peace.

In Ashwood, Thérèse has discovered a renewed sense of purpose and belonging through her connection with The Artisan's Studio and its eclectic community. She continues to nurture her artistic talents, seeking inspiration from the quiet beauty of the town and its people.
