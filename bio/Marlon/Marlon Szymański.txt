Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Marlon Szymański's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marlon Szymański is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He exudes an aura of calmness and introspection, which belies his razor-sharp mind and keen instinct. As a private investigator, he has developed a reputation for being one of the best in the business, which inspires trust and fear in equal measure among his clients and adversaries alike.

**Physical Attributes:** Marlon Szymański stands at approximately 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His dark brown hair is often neatly trimmed, framing a strong, angular face with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly grueling case a few years ago.

**Interests:** Marlon Szymański is an avid reader of classic literature and philosophical texts, often devouring books on psychology, criminology, and forensic science to stay ahead of the game. In his rare moments of leisure, he enjoys playing chess, practicing martial arts, and hiking in the woods surrounding his hometown.

Outside of his work as a private investigator, Marlon Szymański is also an enthusiastic amateur photographer, capturing the beauty of the world through his lens. He has a particular fondness for urban landscapes and street art, which he believes reflect the grittier side of human nature that he often encounters in his line of work.

When not working on cases or indulging in his hobbies, Marlon Szymański can be found sipping whiskey at a local bar, listening to jazz music, or lost in thought as he ponders the intricacies of human behavior and the mysteries that lie within.
