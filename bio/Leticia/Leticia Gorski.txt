Here's a summary of Leticia Gorski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leticia is known for her free-spirited nature, creativity, and warm empathy. She has an innate ability to connect with others on a deep level, as evident in her conversations with Sofia. Her years of self-discovery have given her a unique perspective on life, allowing her to appreciate the imperfections and beauty in the world around her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Leticia stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to move freely in her studio with ease.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, a deep blue-purple hue that seems almost otherworldly. These captivating eyes sparkle when she talks about art or shares her passion for life.
* Hair: Leticia's hair is long and wavy, often falling down her back in loose waves. It's a rich, dark brown color that frames her face and complements her indigo eyes.

**Interests:** As an artist, Leticia is deeply interested in exploring the human experience through her paintings. She finds inspiration in the world around her - the colors of nature, the shapes of architecture, and the stories of people she meets. Her art is not just about rendering reality but also capturing the essence of who she is as a person.

In addition to painting, Leticia enjoys listening to soft jazz music and watching birds chirp outside her studio window. These quiet moments bring her solace and stimulate her artistic vision. She is also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and art history to expand her knowledge and deepen her understanding of the world.

When she's not creating art or teaching others, Leticia can be found lost in thought, gazing out the window as a child did when she was young. This introspective nature allows her to tap into her imagination, seeking inspiration in the stillness of her mind.
