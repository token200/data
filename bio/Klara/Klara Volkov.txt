On the surface, she appears to be a formidable and intimidating individual, exuding an air of quiet authority that commands respect from those who meet her. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a web of emotions and motivations that are far from simple.

In her free time, Klara enjoys practicing martial arts, studying tactics and strategies, and reading books on philosophy and psychology. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for children and animals, and is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Background:** As mentioned in the story, Klara is a retired assassin who has hung up her knives and now works as a freelance bodyguard. She is highly sought after due to her exceptional skills, but refuses to be tied down by contracts or allegiances.
