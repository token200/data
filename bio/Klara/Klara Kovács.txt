Here is a summary of Klara Kovács' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Greenish-blue, with a hint of gold in the right light
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn loose and straight down her back

**Personality:**
Klara Kovács is a curious and determined individual. At thirty-five, she has developed a strong sense of self-reliance and independence, stemming from growing up with stories and secrets collected by her grandmother as a child. Klara's love for her family's history and legacy drives her to uncover the truth about their past, even if it means confronting painful or difficult information.

**Interests:**
Klara is passionate about exploring and understanding her heritage, particularly in relation to historical events and cultural traditions of Hungary. She is deeply interested in learning more about her family's specific history, including stories hidden within the city itself – the city where she grew up, but not necessarily raised as a resident.

Some additional interests might include:

- History and genealogy
- Traveling and exploring new places, especially cities with rich cultural heritage
- Coffee culture (she can often be found sipping coffee in local cafes)
- Storytelling and listening to oral histories passed down through generations

It's clear that Klara is driven by a strong desire for connection between her past and present self. Her encounters with János Szabó, a family historian and relative, help to reconnect these threads of identity.
