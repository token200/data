Here is a summary of Mathilda Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mathilda is a calculating and ambitious individual with a strong sense of determination. She is willing to do whatever it takes to maintain her power and authority, even if it means making pacts with dark forces or crushing potential rivals. Despite this, she has a dry, witty sense of humor and can come across as detached or aloof to those who don't know her. Her people fear her, but they also respect her intelligence and strategic thinking.

**Physical Attributes:** Mathilda stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, honey-blonde color that falls in loose waves down her back, often hiding her pale face from view. Her eyes are an piercing shade of emerald green, almond-shaped and fringed with thick lashes. She has high cheekbones, a small nose, and full lips that curve into a subtle smile when she's pleased or amused.

**Interests:** Mathilda is deeply invested in maintaining the power and influence of her empire, Argentum. She spends countless hours studying politics, diplomacy, and strategy to stay one step ahead of potential threats and rivals. She is also fascinated by the darker corners of magic and the supernatural, often seeking out forbidden knowledge and making pacts with mysterious forces that lurk beyond the veil of reality.

Outside of her imperial duties, Mathilda enjoys playing chess (she's an expert player) and reading ancient texts on philosophy and history. She has a particular fondness for the works of forgotten gods and lost civilizations, which she finds to be both fascinating and intimidating.

Overall, Mathilda is a complex and multifaceted individual whose calculating nature and dark secrets make her a formidable force in the imperial courts of Argentum.
