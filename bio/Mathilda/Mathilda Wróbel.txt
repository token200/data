Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Mathilda Wróbel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mathilda Wróbel is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician with an obsessive nature. She is introverted and prefers to keep a low profile, rarely giving interviews or making public appearances. Despite this, she is driven by a desire for knowledge and is willing to put in countless hours of work to uncover the secrets of fractals.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a neat but disheveled bun
* Build: Petite, with a slender yet athletic build, likely honed from years of intense mental focus and concentration.
* Skin Tone: Pale, possibly due to spending long hours indoors surrounded by equations and papers.

**Interests:** Mathilda's primary interest is mathematics, particularly the study of fractals. She is deeply fascinated by the mysteries of these mathematical sets and spends most of her time researching and working on projects related to their properties and behavior. Her work has garnered international attention, and she is considered one of the leading experts in her field.

It can be assumed that Mathilda's interests may extend beyond mathematics, as hinted at by her encounter with Jakub and his cryptic manuscript. However, her passion for fractals remains the driving force behind her research and pursuits.
