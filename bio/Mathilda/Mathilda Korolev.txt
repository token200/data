Here is a summary of Mathilda Korolev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep brown, almost black
- Hair: Dark brown, often pulled back into a tight ponytail to keep out of the way while working in her laboratory

**Personality:**
- Brilliant and reclusive scientist with a singular focus on quantum mechanics
- Prefers the company of her machines to people, but has a deep appreciation for collaboration when it comes to sharing ideas
- Initially inhospitable due to a fear of being distracted or losing momentum, but warms up to Viktor as they work together
- Complex and deeply human person with a passion for discovery that borders on obsession

**Interests:**
- Studying the mysteries of quantum mechanics (her entire career has been dedicated to this field)
- Conducting experiments in her laboratory (she spends most of her time working, often forgetting about personal needs such as sleep or socialization)
- Analyzing data and solving complex problems
- Reading theoretical physics texts and attending scientific conferences (when not in her laboratory)

Mathilda's isolation is likely due to a fear that the outside world will try to disrupt her focus. However, with Viktor's help, she begins to see that there are benefits to sharing her ideas and learning from others.
