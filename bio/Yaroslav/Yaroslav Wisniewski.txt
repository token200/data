Here is a summary of the fictional character Yaroslav Wisniewski:

**Physical Attributes:** Yaroslav stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build, likely honed from his childhood experiences on the streets. His piercing green eyes seem to be an unnerving intensity, which complements his sharp jawline and angular features.

**Personality:** Beneath his tough exterior, Yaroslav is a complex individual with a deep sense of vulnerability and introspection. He has a mysterious air about him, hinting at secrets he keeps hidden from others. Despite his confidence and self-assurance, there's an underlying fragility that makes him susceptible to the whims of fate. His past experiences have left emotional scars, causing him to carry around a sense of disillusionment and disconnection.

**Interests:** Yaroslav appears to be driven by his desire for truth and understanding about his own life. He is curious and open-minded, willing to confront his demons head-on. On the surface, he seems to value financial security and stability through his work as a bodyguard. However, his meeting with the mysterious woman at the clock tower suggests that there may be more to him than initially meets the eye â€“ perhaps a hunger for knowledge, connection, or redemption.
