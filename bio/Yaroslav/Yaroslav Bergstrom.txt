Here is a summary of Yaroslav Bergstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Yaroslav Bergstrom stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet rugged build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a deep sadness, but also a spark of hope. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many street fights in Moscow.

**Personality:**
Yaroslav Bergstrom, or "Slava" as he is known, is a complex and brooding individual with a troubled past. He is haunted by the memories of his late brother Sergei and struggles to form close relationships due to his difficulty opening up to others. Despite this, Slava has a deep sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often finding himself at odds with authority figures.

**Interests:**
Slava's interests are largely centered around his love of whiskey, music, and art. In his younger years, he was known for his impressive collection of punk rock posters and vinyl records, which he would scrounge up from street vendors in Moscow. He still enjoys listening to loud, aggressive music and has been known to attend underground concerts and music festivals.

Slava's love of whiskey is not just a social pastime, but also a way for him to cope with his emotional pain. He often finds solace in the drink, using it as a temporary escape from his demons. Despite this, he is fiercely independent and refuses to rely on others for support.

In contrast, Slava's interest in art may seem unexpected given his rough exterior. However, during his downtime, he enjoys sketching and painting, particularly portraits of cityscapes and street scenes from Moscow. These sketches serve as a reminder of his connection to his brother Sergei and the streets they once called home.
