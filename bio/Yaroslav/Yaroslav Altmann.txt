Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Yaroslav Altmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yaroslav Altmann is an enigmatic figure with a shroud of mystery surrounding him. He appears to be a master manipulator, able to walk into any situation and extricate himself unscathed. His coy demeanor when approached by the CIA suggests that he has ulterior motives, but his ability to gain notoriety as a freelancer implies a level of confidence and charisma. His reputation as 'The Ghost of Moscow' indicates that he is a skilled operative with a talent for finding creative solutions to complex problems.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue (although this may be a cover story, there are no details in the short story to confirm his actual eye color)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not provide any information about Yaroslav's physical attributes beyond height and eye color. Therefore, I will make some educated guesses based on common traits associated with fictional characters:

* Build: Lean and athletic
* Hair Color: Dark brown or black (to complement his Eastern European background)
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, piercing blue eyes, and chiseled features

**Interests:** Yaroslav's interests are largely tied to his work as a double agent and an expert in infiltration and espionage. He is likely well-versed in various fields such as politics, economics, and international relations, which would aid him in gathering intelligence and navigating complex situations.

However, given the enigmatic nature of Yaroslav's character, it is also possible that he has more personal interests outside of his work. These might include:

* Reading: History, philosophy, or literature (perhaps to maintain a sense of cultural connection with his Eastern European roots)
* Hobbies: Traveling, skydiving, or other adventure sports (to satisfy an itch for excitement and danger)
* Personal relationships: Yaroslav's past is shrouded in mystery, so it's difficult to determine if he has any close friends or romantic connections.
