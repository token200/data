He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring the company of ancient texts to modern society.

**Interests:**
Yaroslav's true passion is unraveling the secrets of ancient magic and forgotten rituals. His interests include:

* Studying old languages and scripts, particularly those related to ancient Latvian poetry and mythology
* Collecting rare and obscure texts on mysticism and the occult
* Practicing various forms of divination and prophecy
