Here's a summary of Saule Bauer's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm brown eyes that sparkle with kindness
* Hair Color: Dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Softly tanned from spending time outdoors at the bakery

**Personality:**
Saule is a complex and introverted person who may come across as warm and inviting on the surface. However, beneath this facade lies a deeply emotional and sensitive individual who has grown up with emotional scars from her parents' passing. Despite her introversion, Saule has a strong sense of empathy and understanding that draws people to her, particularly Jack.

**Interests:**
Saule's passion for baking is all-consuming, and she spends most of her free time perfecting recipes, experimenting with new flavors, and learning about the art of pastry-making. She finds solace in the tactile nature of working with dough, the creativity of designing new desserts, and the joy of sharing her baked goods with others.

Outside of work, Saule enjoys long walks along the creek, stargazing on clear nights, and reading classic literature that speaks to her love of words and stories. She is also an avid listener, always tuning in to people's conversations and stories, which often makes her feel like she's missing out on their lives.

Despite her love for solitude, Saule has a growing appreciation for the simple pleasures in life - watching sunsets, sipping coffee with friends, and enjoying Jack's company.
