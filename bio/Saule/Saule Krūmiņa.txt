Here is a summary of Saule Krūmiņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Saule stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. Her striking feature is her pair of piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with intensity, as if seeing right through you. Her dark hair falls in loose waves down her back, often styled in a sleek and modern manner. She has a small tattoo of the Latvian flag on her left wrist, symbolizing her heritage.

**Personality:** Saule is a complex and enigmatic woman with a dual nature that commands respect and curiosity. On the surface, she exudes confidence and determination, making her a formidable force in business circles. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a web of emotions and motivations, stemming from a childhood marked by loss and a drive to succeed. She is fiercely independent, yet values loyalty and friendship above all else.

**Interests:** Saule has an insatiable appetite for power, influence, and wealth, driving her to build empires in the world of business. However, as revealed through her interactions with Laima, she also harbors a softer side – a desire to make a positive impact on the world through philanthropy. She is drawn to causes that support local charities and initiatives close to her heart, using her resources to create meaningful change in Riga's society.
