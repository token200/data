**Personality:** Saule is an artistic and passionate individual with a deep love for creativity. She is also curious and open-minded, having grown up in a traditional nomadic lifestyle before embracing modern city life. Her stories about her childhood and grandmother's traditional Mongolian patterns suggest that she values cultural heritage and is eager to bring new perspectives to her art.

She is also drawn to the city's vibrant art scene and is eager to learn from other artists, as seen when she introduces herself to Yumi at Sakura no Mori studio.
