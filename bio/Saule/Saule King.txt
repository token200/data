**Personality:**
Saule is a forceful and determined individual, driven by a fierce sense of duty and responsibility to reclaim her birthright as the ruler of Zerzura.

However, she also demonstrates a compassionate side, particularly when interacting with the elders of the oasis who offer her wisdom and support.

**Interests:**

**Additional Insights:**
Saule's past trauma – losing her parents at a young age – still resonates within her, fueling her drive for power and recognition. Despite this, she is not driven by a desire for personal gain or revenge, but rather by a genuine desire to protect and serve the people of Zerzura. Her connection to the desert winds and the stars above suggests that she has a mystical affinity with the natural world, which may grant her unique abilities or insights.
