However, beneath this mask lies a creative and empathetic person who wears their heart on their sleeve through their art. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which has helped her thrive in the cutthroat world of street art.

In addition to painting, Helene enjoys reading poetry and literature, which fuels her imagination and inspires her to push the boundaries of her art.

**Hobbies:** When not creating art or exploring the city for inspiration, Helene can be found practicing yoga or meditation to center herself and find inner peace. She is also a skilled sketchbook artist, often doodling in her notebook during downtime to loosen up her creative muscles.
