Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Helene Huffington:

**Physical Attributes:**
Helene Huffington is a woman of average height, standing at 5'6" (168 cm). Her eye color is a deep brown, often accentuated by her bold and bright makeup choices. She has long, dark hair that she often styles in loose waves, framing her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:**
Helene Huffington is a charismatic and ambitious individual, known for her quick wit and sharp mind. Like Arianna Huffington, she's a true leader who isn't afraid to take risks and push boundaries. She has an infectious energy that draws people to her and inspires them to work towards a shared vision.

**Interests:**
Helene Huffington is a passionate advocate for self-care and wellness. She believes in the importance of getting enough sleep (she claims to get 25 minutes of shut-eye each night!) and making time for activities that nourish both body and mind, such as yoga and meditation. When she's not working on her latest project or launching new campaigns, Helene enjoys listening to soothing jazz music and sipping tea in the comfort of her own home.

Despite her busy schedule, Helene has a creative side and loves trying new things. She's always eager to take on new challenges and push herself outside of her comfort zone. Her enthusiasm is contagious, making those around her feel motivated and inspired to work towards their goals.
