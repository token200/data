He has a strong jawline and sharp features, giving him an otherworldly appearance.

**Interests:** Antti Leroy's love of learning is matched only by his fascination with the unknown and the unexplained. He spends most of his days studying dusty tomes on subjects ranging from botany to zoology, and exploring the mysteries of ancient civilizations and forgotten technologies. His interests also extend to mysticism, alchemy, and occult practices, which he delves into in secret. Despite his reclusive nature, Antti has a deep desire for connection and understanding, which drives him to share his knowledge with those who are brave enough to seek it out.
