Here is a summary of the fictional character Antti Rodriguez Garcia's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Antti stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of salsa dancing. His hair is dark brown and curly, often tied back in a ponytail, revealing his prominent forehead and angular features. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to gleam with excitement whenever he's on the verge of discovery.

**Personality:**
Antti is an adventurous soul with a passion for exploration and discovery. He's fiercely independent and self-motivated, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. His friends might see him as reckless or obsessive, but Antti knows that his determination is what sets him apart. He's also intensely loyal to those he cares about, and will go to great lengths to support and protect them.

**Interests:**
Antti has a deep love for history, archaeology, and anthropology, fueled by years of studying ancient texts and scouring the globe for clues. His expertise lies in deciphering forgotten languages and cryptic symbols, skills honed through his extensive research on lost cities and civilizations. When not trekking through jungles or exploring ruins, Antti enjoys salsa dancing (much to the chagrin of his friends), practicing yoga, and sipping rich coffee in small, hidden cafes.

Some additional interests that can be inferred from the story:

* Antti is a bit of a thrill-seeker, always looking for the next adrenaline rush.
* He has a strong connection to nature, drawn by the beauty and mystery of the natural world.
* Despite his tough exterior, Antti has a vulnerable side, as evidenced by his trembling hands when he finally discovers the lost city.
