Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Antti Sepp:

**Personality:** Antti Sepp is portrayed as a man shrouded in mystery with an aura that precedes him. He exudes a sense of respect and fear from others due to his reputation as a retired detective who has solved some of Helsinki's most baffling cases. This implies that he is intelligent, perceptive, and perhaps even intimidating. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Antti is driven by a strong sense of justice and a determination to uncover the truth, even when faced with danger and deception.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only one physical attribute is mentioned in the original text: Antti's height. It is described as being "of average stature." No other details are provided about his eye color or any other distinguishing features. Given that he has a commanding presence due to his reputation, it can be inferred that he may have an imposing physique, but this remains unconfirmed.

**Interests:** As a retired detective and former solver of complex cases, Antti's primary interest appears to be justice and uncovering the truth. He is deeply invested in solving mysteries and crimes, often putting himself in harm's way to achieve his goals. His work also seems to be driven by a desire to protect vulnerable individuals, such as Sofia, from those who seek to manipulate or control them.

It's worth noting that Antti's interests extend beyond his professional life, as he appears to have a personal stake in uncovering the truth about Sofia's disappearance and bringing her home safely.
