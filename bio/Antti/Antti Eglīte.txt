Based on the provided short story, I have created a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Antti Eglīte:

**Physical Attributes:**
Antti Eglīte is described as having an otherworldly intensity in his eyes, which are said to gleam like moonstones. His height is not explicitly mentioned, but he seems to be a tall figure, commanding respect and awe from those around him.

**Personality:**
Eglīte is portrayed as a mysterious and enigmatic individual, shrouded in secrecy. He exudes an air of power and wisdom, yet also comes across as elusive and hard to understand. His demeanor is calm and collected, but there is a hint of intensity and authority that suggests he is not someone to be trifled with.

**Interests:**
As a sorcerer or demigod (depending on one's interpretation), Antti Eglīte seems to be deeply interested in communicating with the spirits of the land, summoning storms from the skies, and manipulating reality itself. He appears to be drawn to the mysteries of the natural world and is attuned to the subtle energies that flow through it.

**Additional Insights:**
While not explicitly stated in the short story, it can be inferred that Eglīte values knowledge and understanding above all else. His willingness to share his secrets with Lina, albeit cryptically, suggests that he is open to teaching those who are worthy. However, his phrase "The secrets I hold are not for the taking" implies a sense of responsibility and caution, as if he knows that some truths are too powerful to be shared lightly.

Overall, Antti Eglīte appears to be a complex and multifaceted character, embodying both the power of nature and the wisdom of the ages. His mysterious presence inspires awe and wonder in those who encounter him, making him a compelling and intriguing figure in any narrative.
