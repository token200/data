Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Antti Kask:

**Personality:** Antti Kask is a clever and resourceful individual with an unorthodox approach to detective work. He is driven by his insatiable curiosity and unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth, which has earned him the nickname "The Ghost Agent." This title reflects his ability to appear and disappear like smoke, making him a formidable private investigator.

**Physical Attributes:** Antti Kask appears to be a tall individual, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seems to gleam with intensity when he's on the case. He has short, dark brown hair and a chiseled jawline that adds to his rugged charm.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Antti Kask is deeply passionate about solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. His work often takes him down darker alleys, but he remains undeterred by danger or uncertainty. In his free time, it's likely that he enjoys exploring the city, reading crime fiction novels, and indulging in a good cup of coffee (although it's not mentioned if he drinks lattes, like Maria Rodriguez).

In terms of additional details, here are a few more ideas:

* Antti Kask is likely a bit of a loner, but his complicated history with Maria has given him a glimpse into the importance of human connections.
* His work often involves dealing with morally ambiguous cases, which may leave him questioning his own motivations and ethics.
* As "The Ghost Agent," Antti Kask takes pride in being able to slip in and out of shadows unnoticed, using his stealth skills to gather information and avoid detection.
