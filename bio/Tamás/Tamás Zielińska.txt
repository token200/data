Based on the provided story, I can create a summary of Tamás Zielińska's personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Personality:** Tamás is a brilliant, reclusive, and introverted scientist with a passion for neuroscience. Despite her expertise in her field, she has always struggled with social interactions and prefers the company of her books and research to people. However, after meeting Emma, she begins to open up and forms a deep connection with the young woman, revealing a more empathetic and collaborative side to her personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no information available about Tamás's physical appearance in the provided story. To fill this gap, I will make some assumptions:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height would allow her to move comfortably between the laboratory and the cityscape, making it easy for her to gaze out at the views with Emma.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - The dark brown eyes could be a reflection of Tamás's introspective nature and attention to detail in her research.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Tamás is deeply passionate about neuroscience, particularly when it comes to understanding the human brain. Her interests also include reading (documentaries on neuroscience as a child), researching neurological disorders, and collaborating with others (especially Emma).
