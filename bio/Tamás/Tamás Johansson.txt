However, based on his age and profession, it can be inferred that he is likely a middle-aged man, possibly in his 40s or 50s. He may have a somewhat rugged or weathered appearance due to his years of studying abroad and working as a journalist.

**Height:** There is no mention of Tamás's height in the story, but based on his age and profession, he may be around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which is slightly above average height for a Hungarian male.

**Eye Color:** The text does not provide information about Tamás's eye color. It is possible that his eyes are a deep brown or hazel, given the author's attempt to create a distinctive and nuanced character profile through descriptive language and inference.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Tamás is deeply interested in investigative journalism, corruption, politics, and social justice. He appears to be passionate about uncovering the truth and bringing attention to important issues affecting his community. Outside of work, he may enjoy writing (as evidenced by his own notebook), art (given his appreciation for Szilvia's local artwork), and poetry (thanks to his acquaintance with László).
