Based on the inspiration from Tamás Kalnoch's life, I have created a fictional character profile for Tamás Kalniņa:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue, reminiscent of a clear Baltic Sea sky
- Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, styled in a sleek and modern manner

Personality:
Tamás is a highly driven individual with an unrelenting passion for his craft. As a seasoned fencer, he possesses exceptional focus, discipline, and strategic thinking. His competitive spirit fuels him to continually push the boundaries of what is possible, making him a formidable opponent in the piste.

Interests:
Outside of fencing, Tamás enjoys exploring the scenic coastlines and historic landmarks of Latvia (he hails from Riga). He is also an avid enthusiast of classical music, often attending concerts featuring Latvian composers. Additionally, he maintains an interest in martial arts, finding value in the physical and mental discipline required to master these disciplines.

When not training or competing, Tamás can be found visiting local museums to study the history of fencing and its evolution over time. His appreciation for the sport's rich heritage has led him to become a skilled historian of sorts, able to offer insightful commentary on past fencers' techniques and strategies.
