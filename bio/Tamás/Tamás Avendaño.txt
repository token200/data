Here is a summary of Tamás Avendaño's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Tamás stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an unassuming presence. His eyes are a warm, hazel brown that seem to hold a deep kindness. He has a gentle face with a slight wrinkling around his forehead from years of squinting at blueprints and equations.

**Personality:** Tamás is a quiet and introspective person who prefers listening over talking. Despite being a retired engineer, he doesn't let his profession define him; instead, it's his love for art that reveals the more creative side of his personality. He is patient, kind-hearted, and has an unspoken ability to listen that puts people at ease.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Tamás has a passion for painting, which brings him immense joy. In his free time, he loves to set up his easel in the park and lose himself in vibrant colors, letting his brushstrokes dance across the canvas. When not creating art, he enjoys exploring the city's parks and gardens, searching for inspiration from nature.

It's worth noting that Tamás is a 65-year-old man, but this age doesn't seem to slow him down; instead, it has given him a newfound appreciation for life and its simple pleasures.
