Based on Arianna Huffington's life story as an inspiration, I've created a fictional character profile for Tamás Huffington:

**Name:** Tamás Huffington (note: the first name "Tamás" is less common in Western cultures compared to Arianna)

**Age:** Late 40s/Early 50s (exact age not specified)

**Height and Eye Color:** Tamás stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing blue eyes, a trait that seems to be characteristic of Eastern European heritage.

**Personality:** Like her namesake Arianna, Tamás Huffington is driven by a strong desire for social change. She's passionate about advocating for marginalized communities and empowering underrepresented groups. As a natural leader, she has a presence that inspires confidence in those around her. However, Tamás is also humble and willing to listen, often putting the needs of others before her own.

**Interests:** Tamás' interests mirror those of Arianna Huffington's:

* Social justice and women's rights
* Leadership and organizational development
* Literature and philosophy (specifically focusing on Eastern European philosophy)
* Environmental sustainability and wellness

**Background:** Little is known about Tamás' personal life, but it's rumored that she comes from a similar background as her namesake. Her family may be involved in politics or diplomacy, although no specific details are available.

This fictional character profile captures the essence of Arianna Huffington's personality and interests while introducing new traits to create a unique individual.
