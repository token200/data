Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Martins Novak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Martins is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who is intensely focused on his work. He has a deep passion for mathematics and is driven to crack the code of quantum entanglement. Despite his immense talent, he is a solitary figure who prefers the quiet solitude of his laboratory to social interactions. However, with someone like Dr. Patel, he feels comfortable opening up and sharing his ideas.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Martins is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, given that he has spent years working on complex equations and has a sense of authority about him. He stands around 5'10" to 6'0" (178 cm to 183 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: His eyes are brown, with a deep intensity that hints at his intellectual focus. They are perhaps slightly bloodshot from spending long hours staring at equations and diagrams.

**Interests:**

* Mathematics: Martins is an expert mathematician with a passion for quantum entanglement. He spends most of his time working on complex equations and theories.
* Research: He is driven by the desire to crack the code of quantum entanglement and unlock its secrets.
* Family History: Martins has a strong interest in his family's history, particularly his grandmother who first sparked his love for mathematics.

Other interests might include:

* Reading and learning: As a reclusive mathematician, Martins likely spends most of his free time reading scientific papers, attending seminars, or working on personal projects.
* Solitude: He values his alone time and prefers the quiet solitude of his laboratory to social interactions.

It's worth noting that these details are not explicitly stated in the original short story, but they can be inferred based on Martins' behavior and characteristics.
