His reclusive nature has led some to speculate about the intensity of his emotions or even his mental health; however, those close to him have reported that Martins' reserve is merely a coping mechanism for the weight of his intellectual pursuits.

His fixation on interdimensional travel stems from an early fascination with theoretical models of reality, as well as his conviction that there may be more to the universe than what we can observe through our own dimensional lens.
