Based on the inspiration from Dante Alighieri, I have created a fictional character profile for Martins Alighieri:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown, almost black, with golden flecks that seem to sparkle when he's deeply engaged in thought.
* Hair: Dark brown, straight, and often slightly tousled, as if he's just rolled out of bed or been caught in a sudden gust of wind.

**Personality:**

* Martins is a introspective and imaginative individual, with a deep love for storytelling and the written word. He is fiercely independent and values his alone time, but has a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about.
* As a member of a noble family, Martins carries himself with poise and confidence, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a more vulnerable and sensitive soul.
* His connection to Dante's work has instilled in him a sense of justice and a desire to right wrongs, driving him to write stories that explore the complexities of human nature.

**Interests:**

* Martins is an avid reader and writer, devouring books on literature, philosophy, and history whenever he can get his hands on them.
* He is fascinated by the history of his city, particularly its hidden corners and secret gardens, which hold secrets and stories that only reveal themselves to those who know where to look.
* As a lover of music, Martins often finds himself lost in thought while listening to classical compositions or traditional folk songs from around the world.

**Habits:**

* Martins has a habit of getting lost in his own thoughts, often forgetting about his surroundings as he gazes out at the city's sprawling landscape.
* He is a coffee aficionado and can often be found sipping strong espresso in hidden cafes around the city.
* Despite his love for solitude, Martins has a weakness for collecting rare books and manuscripts, which he treasures like precious jewels.

This character profile captures the essence of Martins Alighieri as an imaginative and introspective individual, inspired by Dante's works, with a deep connection to literature, history, and music.
