Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dorota Kov√°cs:

**Personality:** Dorota is described as brilliant and introverted, which suggests that she is highly intelligent and focused on her work. Her passion for cryptography is evident throughout the story, indicating that it drives her and motivates her to solve problems. She also appears to be determined and willing to take risks, as evidenced by her decision to investigate the mysterious message from her friend.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only a few details are provided about Dorota's physical appearance, so I will make some educated guesses:

* **Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Blue (although this is not explicitly stated in the story, blue eyes are often associated with introverted and intelligent personalities)

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, cryptography is Dorota's primary passion. She spends most of her free time deciphering codes and cracking passwords, indicating that she enjoys intellectual challenges and problem-solving.

In addition to cryptography, I would speculate that Dorota is interested in:

* Computer science and programming
* Mathematics (specifically, number theory and combinatorics)
* Science fiction and mystery novels (which might appeal to her analytical mind)

Overall, Dorota appears to be a highly intelligent and driven individual with a strong interest in cryptography and problem-solving. Her introverted nature suggests that she may prefer working independently or in small teams, but her enthusiasm for her work indicates that she is willing to collaborate and share her skills with others.
