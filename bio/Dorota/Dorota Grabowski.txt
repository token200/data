Here is a summary of Dorota Grabowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dorota is a creative and passionate individual who unapologetically pursues her unique interest in taxidermy. Despite initial reservations from her friends about her hobby, she remains confident and dedicated to her craft. She values authenticity and honesty in her relationships, as evident when Aleksandr promises not to make fun of her collection. Over time, Dorota develops a strong sense of self-assurance, thanks in part to Aleksandr's support.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a subtle green undertone
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a messy bun or ponytail
* Body Type: Petite but athletic, with toned arms and hands suitable for handling taxidermy specimens.

**Interests:** Taxidermy is Dorota's primary passion. She spends most of her free time learning new techniques, experimenting with different materials, and creating intricate mounts. Her love for animals and the natural world inspires her work, as she seeks to preserve and celebrate their beauty even in death. In addition to taxidermy, Dorota enjoys reading (especially classics and historical texts), exploring urban landscapes, and collecting unusual artifacts.

Please note that some attributes were left out of the original story, but I inferred them based on common characteristics associated with taxidermists or creative individuals who enjoy unique hobbies.
