**Personality:** Noah is a creative and dreamer individual with a passion for storytelling. He has a strong sense of discontent and frustration with his current situation, which fuels his desire to make a change. Despite struggling financially, he remains optimistic and determined. His creativity simmers beneath the surface, waiting to be unleashed.

**Interests:** Noah's interests seem to be centered around creative pursuits, particularly writing and storytelling. He also appreciates the small things in life, such as observing the natural world (sunlight filtering through skyscrapers, birds singing in the park) and enjoying sensory experiences (smell of freshly baked bread). His interest in writing is evident from his love of creating stories and his passion for crafting a novel that will catapult him to fame.
