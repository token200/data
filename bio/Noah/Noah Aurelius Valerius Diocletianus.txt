Here is a summary of Noah Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Noah is known for his kind heart, exceptional craftsmanship, and dedication to his work. He is a hard worker, meticulous in his attention to detail, and willing to put in the time and effort required to excel at his craft. As he grew older, he became even more humble and grateful for the opportunities he had been given, never forgetting where he came from and always looking out for those around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Noah stands at an impressive 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, with a strong and athletic build developed through years of working in the hot workshop. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and tied back with a leather thong, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to see right through to the heart of the matter. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which adds a touch of rugged charm to his otherwise refined features.

**Interests:** As a master blacksmith and craftsman, Noah has always been passionate about metalworking and the creation of beautiful and functional pieces that bring people together. He takes great pride in his work and is always seeking ways to improve his skills and push the boundaries of what is possible with fire and hammer. In addition to his craft, Noah is also an avid lover of history and the stories of the Roman Empire's greatest leaders, often spending hours pouring over ancient texts and speaking with other scholars about the finer points of classical knowledge.

When he's not working in his forge or sharing tales with friends, Noah can be found playing a mean game of Roman chess or practicing his skills as a poet, weaving words into beautiful verse that celebrate the beauty and majesty of Rome itself.
