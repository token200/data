Here is a summary of Noah de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Noah is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, he appears charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a silver tongue that can win people over. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deeply troubled person who has struggled to come to terms with his family's expectations and his own mistakes. He is fiercely independent and determined to reinvent himself, but still grapples with feelings of inadequacy and guilt. Despite this, he is intensely curious and has a strong desire to connect with others on a deep level.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks, inherited from his Renaissance-era ancestors
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey fashion that suits his carefree and artistic side
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of horseback riding and outdoor activities

**Interests:** Noah is passionate about art, music, and literature. As a member of the de' Medici family, he grew up surrounded by some of the greatest minds in Renaissance Italy, and this exposure instilled in him a love of creativity and self-expression. He enjoys playing the lute and singing, often performing for his new friends in the local tavern. He is also an avid reader and collector of rare books, with a particular fondness for medieval manuscripts and literary classics. When he's not socializing or indulging in creative pursuits, Noah loves to explore the countryside on horseback, taking in the beauty of nature and clearing his mind.

As a reformed scandalous aristocrat turned small-town businessman, Noah is slowly building a new life that reflects his true interests and values. With Lena by his side, he feels like he's finally found a place where he can be himself, without fear of judgment or reprisal from his past.
