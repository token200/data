His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a deep wisdom and understanding of the natural world.

**Personality:**
Noah is a contemplative and introspective person who has learned to find solace in solitude. He is deeply connected to nature and has developed a profound respect for the land and its creatures. His past experiences as a park ranger have given him a sense of duty and responsibility, but he has since traded that life for one of self-discovery and adventure. Noah is introspective, often lost in thought, but also has a dry wit and can be quite sarcastic when needed.

He is also deeply passionate about conservation and preserving the natural world for future generations. On a personal level, Noah values solitude and quiet moments of reflection, finding solace in the stillness of the wilderness.

**Background:**
Noah's past as a park ranger has likely shaped his love for nature and his sense of duty to protect it. However, he seems to have left that life behind, opting for a more solitary existence where he can explore and connect with the natural world on his own terms. His memories of loved ones who have passed on suggest a deeper emotional complexity beneath his rugged exterior.

**Quirks:**
Noah has a tendency to drop his pack and sit on rocks whenever he finds one that feels particularly comfortable or inspiring, indicating his affinity for solitude and stillness. He also seems to be someone who can hold onto memories and emotions from the past, using them as a source of introspection and personal growth.

Overall, Noah Sundberg appears to be a complex and deeply human individual, driven by a desire to connect with nature and understand himself in the process.
