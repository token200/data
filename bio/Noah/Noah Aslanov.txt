Here is a summary of Noah Aslanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Noah Aslanov is a quiet and confident individual with an air of mystery. He has a wry sense of humor and prefers to keep his past firmly in the rearview mirror. Despite being haunted by memories of his past life as an operative, he is at peace with himself and has found a sense of purpose in his simple, everyday life. He is compassionate and values kindness and connection with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Noah Aslanov stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, which adds to his commanding presence without demanding attention. His eye color is a deep, piercing blue that seems to see right through you. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that gives him a slightly rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Noah Aslanov's interests lie in the simple pleasures of life. He is a skilled carpenter who finds joy in working with his hands, creating beautiful pieces of furniture that hold a quiet magic within them. He cherishes moments of beauty and connection with others, finding meaning in everyday acts of kindness and compassion. His past may still linger, but it no longer defines him, and he has found a sense of peace and purpose in his quiet, gentle world.

It's worth noting that the short story doesn't provide many specific details about Noah Aslanov's interests beyond his work as a carpenter. I have expanded on this aspect by suggesting that his interests lie in the simple pleasures of life, which aligns with his personality and values described in the story.
