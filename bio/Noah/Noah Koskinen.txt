**Interests:**

Noah's primary interest lies in fishing and exploring the natural world. He finds solace in the quiet moments spent on the water, watching the sun rise over the horizon, or waiting for a bite in the stillness of the night.

Noah's also shown to have a compassionate side when it comes to protecting the environment and its creatures. His wish for the power to protect these waters and all its inhabitants speaks volumes about his deep respect for the natural world and his desire to be a guardian rather than a predator.
