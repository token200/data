Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Noah Sandström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Noah Sandström is a complex and multi-faceted individual. Growing up on the streets of Stockholm, he learned to rely only on himself, which may have contributed to his guarded nature. However, after serving time in prison for a crime he didn't commit and finding redemption through therapy and his work at the community center, Noah began to open up and show vulnerability. He is fiercely determined and has a strong sense of purpose, particularly when it comes to helping others. Despite his progress, Noah still struggles with nightmares and feelings of guilt, indicating that he may have some underlying emotional scars.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the context of the story, we can make some educated guesses about Noah's physical attributes:

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - This height would allow him to stand tall and authoritative, yet still be approachable.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - The dark color of his eyes could indicate a serious and brooding personality type.
* Hair Color: Dark Blonde or Black - These hair colors would complement Noah's darker eye color and add to his rugged, rough-around-the-edges appearance.

**Interests:** As we can see from the story, Noah has a strong interest in helping others, particularly at-risk youth. He is passionate about creating a mentorship program for these young people and using his own experiences to guide them through life's challenges. This suggests that he may be someone who values personal growth, self-improvement, and social responsibility.

It's also possible that Noah has a strong interest in justice and wanting to clear his name, as this is a driving force behind his efforts to seek exoneration.
