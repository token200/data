Here is a summary of Sofía Kabylbekova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sofía stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with long, lean limbs that reflect her ballet training. Her hair is dark brown and typically styled in a sleek, low bun when she's on stage. Her eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost purple, which seems to sparkle with energy whenever she's behind the DJ booth. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, a token from her underground rave days.

**Personality:** Sofía is a force to be reckoned with - confident, passionate, and unapologetic. As a ballerina, she has honed her discipline and dedication to perfection, but behind the scenes, she's more laid-back and easy-going. She's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking risks that put her at odds with those who expect her to conform to traditional expectations. Despite this, she has a warm and infectious smile that puts those around her at ease.

**Interests:** Sofía is a multifaceted individual with two main passions: ballet and underground rave culture. As a ballerina, she excels on stage, pouring her heart and soul into every performance. Behind the DJ booth, she's in her element, spinning tracks that ignite the crowd and fuel her own creative expression. She's deeply drawn to the energy and community of rave culture, where like-minded individuals come together to celebrate music and self-expression.
