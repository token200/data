**Personality:** Sofía is a introspective and emotionally complex individual. She has a deep sense of nostalgia and a strong connection to her past, which can make it difficult for her to let go of memories and emotions. However, she is also fiercely determined and independent, having spent ten years away from her hometown in an effort to break free from the expectations and obligations that once held her back. As she navigates this new chapter in her life, Sofía is learning to balance her desire for independence with a growing sense of purpose and self-awareness.

* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-smooth complexion with a subtle golden undertone

**Interests:** Sofía has a deep passion for the sea and the coastal town of Kalla, which is reflected in her love of sailing, fishing, and simply spending time near the water. She is also an avid reader and enjoys literature that explores themes of identity, family, and social justice. Music plays a significant role in Sofía's life as well; she has a weakness for melancholic folk melodies that seem to capture the essence of her own emotional landscape.

**Additional Details:** Sofía has a small tattoo of a seagull on her left wrist, which was inked during a impromptu visit to Kalla several years ago. She is also an accomplished painter and sketch artist, often capturing the beauty of the coastal town in her art. Despite her love for solitude, Sofía has a deep desire to reconnect with old friends and make new connections, which she hopes will bring joy and fulfillment into her life as she starts this new chapter.
