She finds solace in the quiet moments spent exploring the city's streets and alleyways, searching for secrets that lie just beneath its surface.

When not engaged in research or exploration, Sofía enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to clear her mind and focus her thoughts. Her love for the natural world also leads her to spend hours stargazing on clear nights, contemplating the mysteries of the universe.

As a professor at the local university, Sofía is well-respected by her peers for her expertise in medieval history. She continues to inspire her students with her passion and enthusiasm, while also nurturing new generations of historians who will carry on her work long after she's gone.
