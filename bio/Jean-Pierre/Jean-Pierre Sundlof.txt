**Physical Attributes:** Jean-Pierre is a tall and slender man, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm). His hair is dark brown and often tousled, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are a deep, soulful brown that seem to hold a world of wisdom behind them. He has a small nose and a subtle scar above his left eyebrow, which he got in a childhood accident.
