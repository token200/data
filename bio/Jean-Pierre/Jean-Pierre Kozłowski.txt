Here is a summary of Jean-Pierre Kozłowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jean-Pierre Kozłowski is a driven and determined individual with an unorthodox approach to detective work. He relies on his intuition and sharp instincts to solve cases, which often puts him at odds with the authorities. Despite this, he remains fiercely committed to justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. His obsession with solving cases can sometimes lead him to neglect his own well-being, but he is ultimately driven by a strong sense of morality.

**Physical Attributes:** Jean-Pierre stands at approximately 5'11" (180 cm) tall, with an athletic build that belies his age. His eyes are a piercing brown that seem to bore into those he interrogates, making him an intimidating presence in the eyes of those he encounters. His dark hair is usually neatly styled, but can become disheveled when his focus is elsewhere. He has a sharp jawline and prominent nose, giving him a resolute appearance.

**Interests:** Jean-Pierre's interests are deeply rooted in his work as a private investigator. He is fascinated by the complexities of human behavior, particularly those who operate on the fringes of society.

Outside of work, he enjoys reading detective fiction and classic literature, often finding inspiration for his own cases in the works of authors like Conan Doyle and Émile Gaboriau.
