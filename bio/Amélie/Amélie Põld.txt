She has a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small tattoo of a paintbrush on her left wrist.

**Personality:** Amélie is a free-spirited and creative individual who sees the world through a lens of wonder and curiosity. Her infectious laughter and bright smile can light up even the most mundane spaces, making her a beloved presence in those around her. She's a bit of a hopeless romantic, always chasing after her dreams and passions with reckless abandon.

**Interests:** Amélie is an avid artist who finds solace in the beauty of the Estonian landscape. She spends hours painting, sketching, and exploring the rolling hills and forests that surround Tartu. Her art is inspired by the intricate patterns of nature, the play of light on water, and the stories of her ancestors.

**Additional Details:** Amélie's love for art runs deep in her family, and she's always felt a connection to her Estonian heritage. She's an avid reader and loves getting lost in books about history, mythology, and philosophy. Her parents, though supportive, are more traditional than she is, which can sometimes lead to a sense of disconnection. Despite this, Amélie is determined to follow her heart and make a name for herself as an artist.
