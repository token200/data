Here is a summary of Claudius Sten's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Claudius Sten is a peculiar individual with an analytical mind and a passion for solving complex problems. He is calm and collected, often to the point of being almost detached from his surroundings. Despite this detachment, he is driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire to unravel mysteries. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as somewhat eccentric or even off-putting to those who don't know him.

**Physical Attributes:** Claudius Sten stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an unassuming, slender build. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he is looking at. His hair is dark and neatly parted, often tucked away under a faded black hat that has become a familiar part of his workshop attire.

**Interests:** Claudius Sten's primary interests revolve around taxidermy and antique clockwork mechanisms. He has an extensive collection of preserved animals in glass-front cabinets, which he meticulously maintains and studies. His true passion lies in understanding the intricacies of clockwork engineering, particularly as it relates to music boxes and other mechanical devices with mysterious properties. This fascination drives him to seek out new challenges and puzzles to solve.

It's worth noting that Claudius Sten's affinity for taxidermy is not necessarily driven by a desire to kill or harm animals, but rather by a genuine curiosity about the natural world and a need to understand the intricacies of life and death.
