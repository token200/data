He has a distinctive swagger to his step and carries himself with confidence. In the story, it's not explicitly stated what Hartwig's eye color is, so I'll introduce him as having piercing blue eyes that twinkle with mischief.

**Physical Appearance:** Hartwig stands at about 5'9" (175 cm), with a lean and wiry build that suggests he was always physically active. His hair is gray and thinning on top, framing his weathered face. He has a few wisps of graying stubble, which adds to his rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Hartwig's interests are deeply rooted in music, having spent decades playing gigs at dingy clubs and sharing cramped apartments with his friends in the underground music scene.
