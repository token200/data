Here is a summary of the fictional character Hartwig Tóth:

**Personality:** Hartwig Tóth is an enigmatic and introspective individual with a unique blend of artistic genius and mysterious nature. He possesses a dry sense of humor and can be somewhat intimidating, as hinted by his narrowed eyes when compared to László Czerny. Despite this, he has a deep passion for his art and the world of mythology and the supernatural, which fuels his creativity.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with an almost black pupil
* Hair Color: Dark blond with subtle hints of auburn
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Tóth's artistic pursuits are only part of his multifaceted interests. He is deeply fascinated by ancient myths and legends, particularly those from Hungarian folklore, which often appear in his paintings. His interest in the supernatural extends beyond art, as he studies various forms of mysticism and curses. In addition to these interests, Tóth seems to have a quiet fascination with psychology, which may contribute to his introspective nature.

These physical and personality traits are fictional but were inspired by the original story, where Tóth is described in more vague terms.
