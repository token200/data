His grandfather's tales of ancient gods and goddesses sparked his interest in the subject, and he has since dedicated his life to uncovering its secrets. He is determined, resourceful, and not afraid to take risks, which has earned him a reputation as a fearless journalist. However, his single-minded focus on finding the Amaranthine Tree also makes him fiercely independent and sometimes comes across as obsessive.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Bright blue, with flecks of green that seem to sparkle in the right light
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt from hours spent outdoors
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of hiking and exploring
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and a scattering of freckles across his nose

**Interests:** Hartwig's love for mythology is rivaled only by his fascination with history, folklore, and the natural world. He spends most of his free time reading about ancient civilizations, studying the symbolism behind various mythological creatures, and exploring the Mediterranean landscape in search of hidden gems. In addition to writing articles and conducting research, he also enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and practicing yoga to maintain his physical and mental balance.

It's worth noting that while Hartwig is a complex character with many interests, his primary focus is on finding the Amaranthine Tree and unlocking its secrets. This drive propels him forward on his journey, often leading him into uncertain and uncharted territory.
