Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Beatrice Liebad:

**Personality:** Beatrice Liebad is an enigmatic figure with a polished exterior that belies her deep-seated passion for art and discovery. She is driven by a fierce determination to succeed and has a razor-sharp mind that serves her well in her role as an art curator. Despite her polished exterior, she has a vulnerable side, particularly when it comes to those who remind her of herself at a younger age, such as Maria. Beatrice is fiercely protective of those she cares about and will go to great lengths to nurture their talents and help them achieve their dreams.

**Physical Attributes:** Beatrice Liebad is likely in her late 40s or early 50s, with an athletic yet refined build that speaks to her dedication to her craft. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with a statuesque presence that commands attention. Her eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up and searching for hidden potential.

**Interests:** Beatrice's primary interest is art itself, particularly the discovery of new talent and the promotion of innovative works. She has an unwavering passion for beauty, creativity, and the transformative power of art to bring people together and spark meaningful conversations. Her work as an art curator takes her to galleries, museums, and private collections around the world, where she seeks out new and exciting pieces to add to her collection.

Aside from her love of art, Beatrice is also drawn to the human stories behind the works she encounters. She has a deep empathy for artists who struggle to make ends meet or face systemic oppression in their communities. Her mentorship of Maria highlights this interest, as she seeks out young artists who remind her of herself at a younger age and are driven by a fierce passion and determination.

In terms of personal interests, it is unclear what Beatrice enjoys doing outside of work, but it can be assumed that she values her time with friends and family, particularly those who share her love of art and creativity.
