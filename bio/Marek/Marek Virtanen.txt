Here's a summary of Marek Virtanen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue-green, which seems to change depending on the light. In certain environments, they appear almost teal.
- Hair: Dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that accentuates his angular features.
- Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical labor and close calls with authorities.

**Personality:**
Marek is a complex individual driven by a mix of motivations. On one hand, he craves freedom above all else. He wants to live life on his own terms without the constraints of society or responsibility for others. This desire often leads him down a path of self-reliance and adventure.

On the other hand, Marek has an inherent sense of justice that sometimes draws him back into his life of crime. His professional skills as a safecracker come from a deep understanding of locks and security systems, which he uses to help those in need or outsmart law enforcement. This dual nature makes Marek difficult to pin down - part rogue outlaw, part social conscience.

Despite the risks, Marek has built a reputation among his peers for being fearless, resourceful, and quick-witted. He is not afraid of danger and can handle himself in almost any situation. However, this confidence might sometimes blind him to potential threats or opportunities.

**Interests:**
- Lockpicking and safecracking are Marek's primary passions, driven by both a curiosity for the mechanics of locks and an aversion to restriction.
- He is fascinated by urban landscapes, especially at night when city lights cast their glow. The anonymity they offer allows him to blend into crowds.
- Music plays a significant role in Marek's life as well - he enjoys listening to traditional Finnish folk music during downtime or before big jobs, though his tastes are eclectic and not strictly tied to his heritage.

These interests give Marek the edge he needs to navigate complex situations and make difficult choices, whether they involve outsmarting rivals like Juhani or confronting the morality of his actions as a safecracker.
