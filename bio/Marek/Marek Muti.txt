**Personality:** Marek is a passionate and intense individual consumed by his art. He has a strong sense of empathy and can see the world through the eyes of others, which fuels his creativity and drives him to create art that captures the essence of humanity's complexities. Despite his dedication to his craft, he remains humble and compassionate, always willing to lend a listening ear or help those in need.

**Physical Attributes:** Marek is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, with an athletic build and slender physique. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which gives him an air of confidence as he navigates the crowded streets of Prague. His eye color is a deep, piercing brown that seems to bore into those he meets, conveying his intense focus on life and art.

It's worth noting that Marek appears to be an introverted individual who is more comfortable expressing himself through art than in everyday conversation. However, when he finds someone who needs his help or support, he becomes fiercely compassionate and empathetic, as demonstrated by his interaction with the young girl clutching her tattered family photograph.
