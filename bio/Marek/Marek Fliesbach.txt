His eye color is also not mentioned, although his piercing gaze is hinted at when Sophia notices him staring into the fire. In terms of build or appearance, no details are provided, suggesting that he may be lean and unassuming.

**Interests:** Marek Fliesbach seems to have a deep-seated restlessness and a desire for adventure, as evidenced by his long travels with only a backpack and dwindling sense of purpose. He also appears to appreciate a good drink, whiskey being his choice of preference. Additionally, he is drawn to the natural world, as suggested by his comfort in the pub's setting and his appreciation for the fire crackling in the hearth.
