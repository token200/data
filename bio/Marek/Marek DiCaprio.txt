Based on the story about Jack Dawson from "Titanic" (1997), I've created a fictional character profile for Marek DiCaprio:

**Name:** Marek DiCaprio
**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1"
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a hint of green around the edges
* Hair: Dark brown, messy and unkempt, often styled with a bit of seaweed or saltwater spray
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of working on the docks and sailing

**Personality:**

* Marek is a free spirit, always chasing his dreams and taking risks. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a strong sense of justice.
* Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand.
* Marek is deeply emotional and empathetic, able to feel the weight of others' struggles and connect on a deep level.
* He's fiercely loyal to those he cares about, and will stop at nothing to protect them.

**Interests:**

* Sailing and the ocean
* Music (especially sea shanties and folk ballads)
* Reading (he's particularly fond of poetry and classics)
* History (especially the stories of maritime disasters and tragedy)
* Art (he's an avid sketcher and loves capturing the beauty of the world around him)

**Background:**

Marek grew up on the streets of Liverpool, where he met Jack Dawson in his younger years. The two became fast friends, sharing a love for adventure and a sense of mischief. After Jack's passing, Marek was devastated, but he knew that Jack's spirit lived on through their shared experiences and memories.

As he navigates life after Jack's death, Marek finds himself drawn to the sea once again, searching for meaning and purpose in his own journey. He continues to hold onto the lessons Jack taught him: about hope, resilience, and living life to the fullest.
