**Interests:** Marek has a passion for art, history, and rare artifacts. He's particularly drawn to ancient relics and valuable collectibles that can be used as leverage in his high-stakes heists. When not swindling the wealthy elite, Marek enjoys exploring the underbelly of New Haven, uncovering hidden gems and secret spots that few others know about.

In his free time, Marek is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, psychology, and philosophy to keep his mind sharp and refine his con artist skills.

Marek's interests also extend to the arts, with a secret fondness for classical music and literature. He's often found listening to Chopin's nocturnes or reciting Shakespearean sonnets to himself when he needs to clear his head or maintain a charming facade.

Despite his tough exterior, Marek has a soft spot for stray animals and underdogs, which can sometimes make him more empathetic towards those in need. This complex mix of traits makes Marek a fascinating and unpredictable character, always keeping those around him on their toes.
