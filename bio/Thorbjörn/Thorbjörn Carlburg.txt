Here's a summary of Thorbjörn Carlburg's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thorbjörn is a determined and resourceful individual with a strong sense of curiosity. As a freelance journalist, he has developed a healthy dose of skepticism, which serves him well in his investigation. He is also fiercely independent and can come across as introverted or aloof to those who don't know him. Despite this, he has a deep-seated desire to uncover the truth and expose hidden mysteries.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, almost piercing in intensity
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a fit physique

**Interests:** Thorbjörn is deeply passionate about investigative journalism and uncovering hidden truths. He has a keen eye for detail and is skilled at piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments of information. Outside of his work, he enjoys exploring the city of Stockholm and discovering new, lesser-known neighborhoods to explore. He is also an avid reader of history and science fiction, which fuels his imagination and inspires him to tackle complex mysteries.

**Additional Details:** Thorbjörn has a distinctive habit of tapping his pen on his notebook when thinking or deep in conversation. He is often seen wearing a faded denim jacket with leather patches and a hint of a smile, giving off an air of quiet confidence that belies his intense focus on his work. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for stray animals and lost causes, which sometimes motivates him to take risks in pursuit of the truth.
