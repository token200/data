Based on the short story and real-life figure of Martina Navratilova, I've created a fictional character profile for Thorbjörn Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue
- Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of gray at the temples
- Build: Athletic and lean

**Personality:** 
Thorbjörn is a kind-hearted and supportive individual who has always been Martina's biggest advocate. He is fiercely protective of those he cares about and will go to great lengths to ensure their happiness and success. Thorbjörn is also deeply rooted in his Czech heritage, often incorporating traditional folk music and dance into his daily life.

**Interests:** 
- Traditional Czech cuisine (he enjoys cooking hearty meals like goulash and svickova)
- Tennis (as the proud adoptive father of a tennis legend, he attends as many matches as possible to cheer her on)
- Classical music (he plays the violin in his spare time)
- Traveling (he loves exploring new places and experiencing different cultures)

**Additional Details:** 
- Thorbjörn has two sons with Martina Navratilova, who inherited their mother's tennis skills and athleticism.
- Despite being a devoted adoptive father, he still maintains strong ties to his Czech roots, often visiting family in Prague during the summer months.
- He runs a small bakery on the side, specializing in traditional Czech pastries like koláč and svičková.

While not as flashy as Martina Navratilova herself, Thorbjörn's quiet dedication and love for those around him make him a beloved figure in his own right.
