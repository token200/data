Here's a summary of Thorbjörn Kamiński's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Thorbjörn "Kami" Kamiński stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with a lean, athletic build. His short, dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his angular features and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Kami is a man of mystery, always keeping people at arm's length to protect himself from the danger that comes with his line of work. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a complex individual driven by a strong sense of loyalty and a desire for redemption. Kami is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking on jobs that challenge the status quo.

**Interests:** When not evading factions or pulling off heists, Kami enjoys flying high-speed aircraft, tinkering with his custom-built motorcycles, and experimenting with advanced technology in his makeshift workshops. He's also an avid reader of science fiction novels and has a fascination with the potential implications of emerging technologies on society.

Despite his tough exterior, Kami has a soft spot for art, music, and poetry, often seeking out underground galleries and underground music scenes to experience the creative side of human expression. His ultimate goal is to break free from the underworld and forge a new path that prioritizes personal freedom and growth over mere survival.

**Other:** Little is known about Kami's past beyond his troubled childhood, which may have contributed to his early involvement in the underworld. Some speculate that he may have had a brief stint in the military or working for a government agency before getting drawn into smuggling and thievery. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain: Kami is a force to be reckoned with, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible and challenging those around him to question their own assumptions about right and wrong.
