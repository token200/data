Based on the short story, here's a summary of Thorbjørn Meier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Vibrant blue, almost icy in color
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt

Thorbjørn's striking features make him stand out in a crowd. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. His dark hair is always unruly, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that belies his intellectual intensity.

**Personality:**

* Highly intelligent and driven, with a passion for discovery
* Guarded and introverted, preferring solitude over social interactions
* Quick-witted and resourceful, able to think on his feet in high-pressure situations
* Can be fiercely independent and stubborn at times, but ultimately values humility and collaboration

Despite his reserved nature, Thorbjørn has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation calls for it. However, he is not one for small talk or superficial conversations, preferring to focus on the substance behind the surface.

**Interests:**

* Magical research and experimentation
* Academic pursuits, particularly in the fields of magical energies and arcane theory
* Solitude and introspection, often spending hours lost in thought or staring at the stars

When not surrounded by the trappings of his academic career, Thorbjørn finds solace in the quiet rhythms of nature. He is an avid reader, devouring tomes on everything from ancient mythology to modern scientific theory. His fascination with the mysteries of the universe drives him to continue pushing the boundaries of magical knowledge.

As a result of his reclusive tendencies, Thorbjørn's social life is relatively nonexistent, and he tends to rely on a small circle of trusted friends and colleagues for support. Despite this, he remains fiercely dedicated to his craft, always seeking to improve his skills and unlock new secrets of the arcane arts.
