Here's a summary of the fictional character Thorbjörn Jankowska:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, a trait inherited from his Eastern European heritage
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a short, practical style that suits his rugged lifestyle

Personality:
- Thorbjörn is a complex and introspective individual, haunted by the memories of his past experiences as a spy.
- Despite this, he possesses an unyielding sense of justice and will not hesitate to take action when he perceives a threat to those around him.
- He is fiercely independent and values his solitude, yet has a deep connection with nature that brings him peace.

Interests:
- Thorbjörn is deeply passionate about farming and tending to his land. The simple, manual work of farm life provides him with a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
- He is also an avid outdoorsman, enjoying long walks in the Swedish wilderness, hunting, and fishing for sport.
- In his free time, he reads history books and biographies, particularly those about Eastern European leaders and figures from his native Poland.

In terms of hobbies or skills outside of farming, it's worth noting that Thorbjörn retains many of the skills he developed during his years as a spy, including marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and surveillance techniques. However, these talents are largely used for self-defense and protecting his community, rather than any malicious purposes.
