Based on the short story inspiration provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Aoki Larsen:

**Physical Attributes:** Aoki is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic yet slender build. Her long black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night, falling in loose waves to her hips. Her piercing green eyes seem to sparkle with an otherworldly intensity, and her full lips curve into a subtle, enigmatic smile. She has a small tattoo of a serpent coiled around her right wrist, a symbol that holds personal significance for her.

**Personality:** Aoki is a free-spirited individual with a passion for the mystical and unknown. She's drawn to music with an otherworldly quality, often finding solace in its haunting melodies and rhythms. Her curiosity and desire for knowledge drive her to explore the unexplained, and she's not afraid to venture into the shadows to uncover hidden truths. Aoki is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to follow her own path rather than conforming to societal norms.

**Interests:** Music (especially jazz and ambient soundscapes), spirituality, mysticism, the occult, and esoteric knowledge. She's an avid reader of ancient texts and occult literature, seeking to understand the secrets of the universe. Aoki is also an amateur musician, often playing instruments like the violin or piano in private sessions to tap into her creative energies.

**Background:** Little is known about Aoki Larsen's past, but it's rumored that she's been drawn to mystical pursuits since childhood. Her family has a long history of spiritual exploration and experimentation, with some members even practicing forms of magic. Despite her enigmatic nature, Aoki seems to be driven by a deep desire to understand the mysteries of existence and her place within them.

**Motivations:** Aoki's motivations are complex and multifaceted. She's drawn to the unknown and the unexplained, seeking answers to life's greatest questions. Her encounters with the mystical and supernatural have sparked a sense of wonder and curiosity in her, driving her to continue exploring the hidden realms. At the same time, Aoki is haunted by secrets from her past, and her interactions with mysterious figures like the one she met at the jazz club may be connected to unlocking these hidden truths.

**Flaws:** Aoki's independence and non-conformity can sometimes make it difficult for her to form close relationships or connect with others on a deep level. Her curiosity and desire for knowledge can also lead her down rabbit holes of obsession, causing her to neglect other aspects of her life in pursuit of the unknown.
