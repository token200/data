Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Aoki Flavius Vespasianus:

**Personality:** Aoki is a humble, resilient, and brave individual who values hard work and determination. Despite his small stature, he has a strong sense of self-confidence and leadership skills, which were developed through his martial arts training and experience leading groups of apprentices. He is fiercely loyal to his comrades and countrymen, and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Physical Attributes:** Aoki stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are a deep brown color that seem to bore into those he looks at, giving him an unwavering intensity. His hair is dark and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look even smaller than he is.

**Interests:** Aoki's interests lie in martial arts, strategy, and tactics. He finds great joy in training and honing his skills with a sword or shield, and is always looking for new ways to improve himself. He also has a strong appreciation for the simple things in life, such as a warm meal or a good night's sleep. Aoki values humility and hard work above all else, and sees true strength not in wealth or status but in one's character.

It's worth noting that while the story doesn't mention Aoki's interests outside of martial arts, it can be inferred that he has a strong sense of duty and loyalty to his comrades and countrymen. He may also have an interest in history and the ways of the Roman legions, given his rise through the ranks and eventual acceptance by Emperor Vespasian himself.
