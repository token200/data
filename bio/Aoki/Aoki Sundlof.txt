Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aoki Sundlof's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Aoki Sundlof is an unconventional thinker who operates on a different frequency than others. They are unorthodox in their approach to time management, preferring to let projects unfold naturally rather than adhering to strict deadlines. This leads to a fluid and flexible schedule that can be challenging for those around them to adapt to. Despite this, Aoki has a childlike wonder and creativity that is infectious, as evidenced by their enthusiasm for art and invention.

Physical Attributes:
* Height: Aoki's height is not specified in the story, but based on the description of their workshop as "makeshift" and cluttered, it is possible to imagine them as slightly above average or slightly below average stature.
* Eye Color: Their eye color is not mentioned in the story, but given their whimsical nature, it would be fitting if they had an eye-catching or striking eye color such as bright blue, emerald green, or a warm, earthy brown.

Interests:
Aoki Sundlof's primary interests are art and invention. They seem to find inspiration in the world around them, often incorporating natural elements into their work (as seen with the mechanical butterfly). Aoki is also drawn to exploring new ideas and concepts, as evidenced by their tinkering with gadgets in their workshop. Their approach to creativity is holistic, encompassing both technical innovation and artistic expression.

In terms of interests outside of art and invention, there are hints that Aoki may have a fascination with the mystical or spiritual aspects of existence. The mention of "a particularly lucid dream" as an inspiration for one of their projects suggests that they may be open to exploring the realms of the unknown or the subconscious.
