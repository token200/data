Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Aoki Bērziņa:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Vibrant turquoise (a unique shade that reflects her Latvian heritage)

**Personality:**
Aoki is an inquisitive and introverted individual with a passion for discovery. Her quiet nature allows her to blend into the crowds, but she has a magnetic personality that draws people to her. Aoki's insatiable curiosity drives her to explore the world around her, often leading her to hidden gems and secrets.

**Interests:**
- Latvian folklore and mythology
- History and cultural heritage
- Ancient traditions and customs
- Local market exploration and vendor conversations
- Nighttime wanderings through Riga's streets, observing city life

These attributes have been woven together based on the initial story, which was intentionally left vague to encourage creativity. Aoki Bērziņa is now a fully fleshed-out fictional character with her own distinct personality, interests, and characteristics that reflect her connection to Latvian culture.
