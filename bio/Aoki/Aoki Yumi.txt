Here's a summary of Aoki Yumi's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the given short story:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height suggests that Yumi is slightly above average, but not unusually tall for an adult.
- Eye Color: Indigo - Her unique eye color sets her apart from others, giving her a distinctive and mysterious appearance.
- Hair Color: Raven-black - Long, flowing black hair adds to her enigmatic presence and emphasizes her connection to the night.
- Skin Tone: Not explicitly mentioned, but given that she is an oni (a supernatural creature often depicted as having pale skin), it can be inferred that Yumi has a pale complexion.

**Personality:**
Yumi's personality seems complex, driven by contradictions. She is trapped between her human and oni sides, struggling with the expectations of her family's legacy while yearning to be more like humans. Despite this, she appears to have a deep sense of hope and determination, particularly in her interactions with Kaito. Her presence in the story suggests that Yumi is fiercely independent, resourceful, and possibly vulnerable at times due to her dual nature.

**Interests:**
Yumi seems to have an innate connection with the ocean and possibly other supernatural beings like oni. She has a deep sense of longing for human experiences (like feeling warmth from sunlight or softness in hair) that are denied to her as an oni, suggesting she is curious about life beyond her natural state. Her interaction with Kaito suggests that she values companionship and understanding, particularly if it can help her navigate her unique situation.

In essence, Aoki Yumi appears to be a character deeply conflicted between her oni heritage and her human side, seeking connection and a path forward in a journey of self-discovery.
