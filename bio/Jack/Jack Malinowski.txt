Here is a summary of Jack Malinowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Jack stands at 5'10" tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his former life as a NYPD detective. He has short, dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes, which seem to hold a depth of experience and understanding. His wire-rimmed glasses perch on the end of his nose, giving him a slightly owlish appearance.

**Personality:** Jack is a complex individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he appears stoic and reserved, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep well of empathy and a strong sense of justice. He has a dry, witty sense of humor that he uses to deflect from his true emotions, which are often clouded by the weight of his past experiences.

Despite his tough exterior, Jack is deeply compassionate and genuinely cares about the people who cross his path. This is evident in his willingness to take on Lena's case and help her find her missing sister. He is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, having been disillusioned with the police system that failed him in the past.

**Interests:** Jack's interests are centered around justice, justice, and more justice. As a private investigator, he takes cases that involve social inequality, corruption, and personal injustices. He has a particular interest in cases involving vulnerable individuals, such as children or those with disabilities.

On a personal level, Jack enjoys long walks through the city streets at night, when the crowds have thinned out and the world is at its most surreal. He is also an avid reader of true crime novels and biographies of legendary detectives, who inspire him to be better at his job.

In terms of hobbies, Jack doesn't seem to have many outside of work. However, he does enjoy a good whiskey on the rocks after a long day, and has been known to visit the Brooklyn Museum on occasion to indulge in some art and culture.
