Based on the short story, here's a summary of Jack Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jack is a man who prefers to keep to himself, indicating that he values his independence and may find it challenging to open up to others. However, there's something about Madame Dupont that makes him feel at ease, suggesting that he has a soft spot for kind and empathetic people. He's likely introverted and may struggle with emotional connections, but the moment he shares stories with Sophie makes him feel strangely exposed yet at peace.

**Physical Attributes:** Jack is described as having:

* A long coat plastered to his back, which suggests that he may be of average to above-average height (he's not particularly noted for being short or tall).
* Gray eyes, although the story doesn't specify this.
* Gravelly voice from years of smoking.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Jack enjoys:

* Coffee and baked goods: He visits Madame Dupont's caf√© regularly, which suggests a fondness for her establishment and possibly her products.
* Conversation: When Sophie arrives, Jack finds himself drawn into their conversation, sharing stories and anecdotes he hadn't shared with anyone in years. This implies that he values engaging in meaningful discussions with others.
* People-watching: As he observes Sophie from afar, Jack seems to be fascinated by her personality and interactions with Madame Dupont.

Overall, Jack Lemoine appears to be a complex individual with a mix of introverted and social tendencies. His affinity for solitude is offset by his ability to connect with those who genuinely interest him.
