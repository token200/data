In her free time, Réka enjoys attending local exhibitions, gallery openings, and street festivals, where she can immerse herself in the creative energy surrounding her. She is also an avid reader, devouring books on art history, psychology, and philosophy to broaden her understanding of the world and fuel her own creativity.
