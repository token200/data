**Personality:** Anika appears to be a introspective and sentimental person who values quiet solitude and connection with nature. She seems to be someone who struggles with the chaos of city life and longs for a sense of peace and tranquility. She is also deeply connected to her family's history and tradition, which plays an important role in her emotional well-being.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no specific details about Anika's physical attributes provided in the story, so I will make some assumptions based on the narrative:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This is a reasonable height for a woman who seems to be able to move comfortably through the woods.
* Eye Color: Green or hazel - The author's description of the forest and Anika's own observations of nature suggest that she might have eyes that match the natural surroundings.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Anika is interested in:

* Nature and the outdoors - She spends a lot of time exploring the woods and appreciates the beauty of the natural world.
* Family history and tradition - The cabin holds significant emotional value for her, and she feels connected to her family's past through its stories and traditions.
