Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Tadeusz Durchdenwald's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tadeusz Durchdenwald is an unlikely hero who embodies bravery, resourcefulness, and kindness. Despite being a retired accountant, he displays a strong sense of determination and selflessness when faced with danger. He is able to think on his feet and navigate treacherous situations with ease, which belies his bookkeeping background. His actions are guided by a desire to help others, particularly the elderly woman searching for her grandson.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Graying brown hair, often neatly combed and parted on the side

While not extensively described in the story, these physical attributes can be inferred from Tadeusz's demeanor and actions. His height and bright blue eyes convey a sense of confidence and intelligence, while his grayish-brown hair suggests a more mature age.

**Interests:** Before becoming a hero, Tadeusz Durchdenwald was likely an avid numbers person, deeply invested in accounting and bookkeeping. He spent most of his life balancing ledgers and crunching figures for the city government. However, after the war, his interests shifted towards helping others and making a positive impact on his community. The story suggests that he now finds meaning in his work as a guardian of hope, rather than solely focusing on numbers.

Additionally, Tadeusz might have developed an interest in history, particularly Polish history, given his involvement in the events of 1944. His actions during the war suggest a deep-seated commitment to protecting the innocent and standing up against oppression.
