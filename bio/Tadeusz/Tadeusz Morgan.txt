Here is a summary of the fictional character Tadeusz Morgan:

**Personality:** Tadeusz Morgan is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He possesses a unique blend of wit, intelligence, and quiet determination, which served him well in his years as an espionage operative. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep emotional wellspring, and his experiences have left him with a lingering sense of vulnerability and longing for hope.

**Physical Attributes:** Tadeusz stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build that speaks to his years of physical training. His piercing blue eyes seem almost otherworldly in their intensity, while his sharp jawline is accentuated by a few days' worth of stubble, giving him an air of ruggedness. He has short, dark hair that's always neatly trimmed, and a small scar above his left eyebrow from a past injury.

**Interests:** As a former intelligence operative turned freelance consultant, Tadeusz's interests are diverse and eclectic. He is highly skilled in surveillance, sabotage, and extraction, and has an affinity for languages (he speaks fluent Polish, English, Russian, German, and French). He is also an avid whiskey enthusiast and enjoys sipping on fine whiskeys at dingy bars like the one he frequented in Berlin.

In his personal life, Tadeusz is a voracious reader and collector of rare books and documents. He has an intense curiosity about history, particularly Eastern European politics and culture, which drives his motivations for seeking answers about Agnieszka's disappearance.

**Other details:** It's worth noting that Tadeusz's past experiences have left him with some physical and emotional scars. He has a few missing teeth and a slight limp from a past injury, which he often tries to mask by wearing a silver prosthetic tooth. His eyes still hold a hint of sadness, and his face sometimes betrays a deeper sadness when he thinks about his sister's fate.

Overall, Tadeusz Morgan is a deeply humanized character with a complex and nuanced personality that drives his motivations and actions throughout the story.
