Here's a summary of the fictional character Tadeusz Müller:

**Physical Attributes:**
Tadeusz Müller is a man in his late 50s or early 60s, with a slightly worn appearance that reflects his age and profession. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which was typical height for a Pole during the post-WWII era. His hair is gray, cut short and neatly styled, often revealing a few wisps of white above his eyebrows. Müller's eyes are an arresting feature - they're deep brown, almost piercing in their intensity.

**Personality:**
Müller is a complex individual with multiple personas. On the surface, he appears to be a retired architect with a quiet, reserved demeanor, possibly even shy or introverted at times. However, beneath this façade lies an intelligent, resourceful, and highly skilled thief with a passion for puzzles and games. Müller's dual nature makes him both fascinating and intimidating, as he seems to know his own secrets better than anyone else.

**Interests:**
Müller is driven by two distinct passions:

1. **Architecture**: As a retired architect, Müller still finds joy in designing grand houses with precision and care.
2. **Thievery and Puzzle-Solving**: Under the cover of night, Müller transforms into a master thief, using his intellect and cunning to leave behind clever puzzles for his pursuers to unravel.

When he meets the mysterious woman at the clock tower, Müller discovers that she shares similar interests in deception, cunning, and puzzle-solving. This sparks an unexpected connection between the two characters, setting them on a path of collaboration and adventure.

**Additional Traits:**
Müller seems to be someone who is both introspective and fiercely independent, with a keen sense of self-awareness that allows him to recognize his own dual nature. He's intelligent, analytical, and highly skilled, but also capable of vulnerability and emotional depth.
