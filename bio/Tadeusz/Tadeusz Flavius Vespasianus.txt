Here is a summary of Tadeusz Flavius Vespasianus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Tadeusz Flavius Vespasianus stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of sneaking and climbing through the streets of Rome. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face and piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with mischief. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly daring escapade.

**Personality:** Tadeusz is a charismatic and cunning individual, with a quick wit and silver tongue that can talk his way out of (or into) almost any situation. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, delighting in pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and respectable in Roman society. Despite his questionable morals, he has a certain charm and allure that draws people to him, often making it difficult for them to discern friend from foe.

**Interests:** Tadeusz has an insatiable appetite for adventure, wealth, and power. He is passionate about collecting rare and valuable artifacts, which he displays in his hidden lair (a secret network of tunnels and caverns beneath the city). He is also an avid student of ancient history and philosophy, often incorporating these interests into his heists and cons to add an air of authenticity to his exploits.

In his free time, Tadeusz enjoys attending high-society gatherings, where he can mingle with the elite and gather information about potential targets for his next heist. He is also a skilled dancer, often using his charisma and charm to distract his marks while he works his magic.

Overall, Tadeusz Flavius Vespasianus is a complex and intriguing individual, driven by a desire for excitement, wealth, and notoriety. His reputation as a master thief and con artist has cemented his place in Roman legend, and it remains to be seen whether he will ever tire of the thrill of the chase or succumb to the allure of a life without secrets.
