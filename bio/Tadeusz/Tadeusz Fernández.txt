Here is a summary of Tadeusz Fernández's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Tadeusz Fernández is a tall and lean man in his late 50s, standing at around 6'2" with an imposing presence. His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, giving off an air of intensity and intelligence. His dark hair is thinning on top, but still retains a hint of texture and depth. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly grueling case when he was younger.

**Personality:**
Tadeusz Fernández is a man of few words and even fewer smiles, but those who know him can't help but be drawn to his dry wit and sharp instincts. As a retired detective, he has spent years honing his skills as an observer, listening to the whispers of the streets, and reading between the lines of human behavior. He is fiercely intelligent and has a natural ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues, making him one of the best detectives in his field.

Despite his tough exterior, Tadeusz Fernández has a soft spot for those who are vulnerable or in need of help. He is deeply compassionate and empathetic, often going above and beyond to ensure that justice is served. However, he can also be quite stubborn and resistant to change, which sometimes puts him at odds with those around him.

**Interests:**
Tadeusz Fernández has a deep love for the city's darker corners, where the shadows dance across the walls and the whispers of the past linger in the air. As a detective, he was drawn to the thrill of the chase, the puzzle-solving aspect of his work, and the satisfaction of unraveling the tangled threads of human deception.

In his retirement, Tadeusz Fernández has taken up reading as a hobby, devouring books on psychology, criminology, and philosophy. He is particularly fascinated by the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle, whose writing styles and analytical minds resonate deeply with him.

When not busy solving mysteries or curled up with a good book, Tadeusz Fernández enjoys long walks along the riverbank, where he can clear his mind and listen to the whispers of the past.
