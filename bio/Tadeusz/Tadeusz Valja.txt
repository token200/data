Here is a summary of Tadeusz Valja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tadeusz Valja is an enigmatic and mysterious individual, shrouded in secrecy. He appears to be calm and collected, often using his soothing voice to put those around him at ease. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a complex web of intrigue, with hints of intensity and determination that suggest he will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about his past and the stolen vase.

**Physical Attributes:** Tadeusz Valja is described as having piercing green eyes, which seem to bore into those he looks at. He also appears to have an enigmatic smile, though its origins and nature are unknown. In terms of height, I would estimate him to be around 6'1" (185 cm), allowing him to appear confident and commanding without being overly imposing.

**Interests:** As a renowned art dealer on the black market, Tadeusz Valja's primary interest is in acquiring and selling rare and valuable pieces. He seems to have a deep passion for his work, which drives him to build a reputation as someone who can be trusted with the most elusive and coveted items. However, beneath this surface-level interest lies a more complex motivation: an obsession with uncovering the secrets of his own troubled past, which he believes is connected to the theft of the vase.

It's worth noting that Tadeusz Valja appears to be driven by a desire for truth and justice, rather than personal gain or material wealth. This sense of purpose suggests that he may have a stronger moral compass than initially meets the eye, and that his enigmatic nature may be hiding a more nuanced personality than he allows others to see.
