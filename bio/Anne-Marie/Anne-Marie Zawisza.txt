Here is a summary of the fictional character Anne-Marie Zawisza:

**Physical Attributes:**
Anne-Marie is a 35-year-old woman with a slender yet athletic build, likely due to her years of working on fishing boats. She has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, and piercing blue-green eyes that seem to sparkle with a sense of adventure. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:**
Anne-Marie is a driven and passionate individual who is deeply committed to protecting the marine ecosystem. She is intelligent and resourceful, having studied marine biology in Warsaw and become an expert in her field. Despite her academic achievements, she remains humble and grounded, with a strong sense of empathy for those affected by environmental degradation. Anne-Marie is also fiercely determined and will stop at nothing to advocate for the causes she believes in.

**Interests:**
Anne-Marie's primary interest is marine conservation, specifically studying the impact of pollution on marine life. She is deeply passionate about preserving the delicate balance of the sea's ecosystem and has dedicated her career to finding solutions to these problems. In her free time, Anne-Marie enjoys sailing, hiking, and exploring the coastline, all of which allow her to connect with nature and feel a sense of purpose.

It's worth noting that some details, such as height, were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, but I have tried to fill in the gaps based on the character's personality and background.
