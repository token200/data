However, based on her occupation and interests, it can be inferred that she might have a somewhat reserved or understated demeanor. Assuming she is of average height for a Swedish person (around 5'7"-5'9" / 170-175 cm), and considering her love for books and dusty archives, her style might lean towards more eclectic and intellectual fashion.

She also appears to be drawn to the spiritual and symbolic aspects of ancient knowledge, which is evident in her connection with Lars Petter Larsson's book.

**Additional Interests:** Given her love for dusty archives and obscure texts, it can be inferred that Dominika might have a broader interest in collecting and studying rare books, manuscripts, and artifacts related to history, mythology, and the occult.
