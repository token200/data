Here is a summary of Dominika Chia-wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dominika is a confident and cunning individual with a mysterious air about her. She has built a reputation as a skilled thief and con artist, but deep down, she has a strong sense of self-preservation and determination to stay one step ahead of her adversaries. Despite her tough exterior, there are hints that she may be vulnerable to emotional connections and is intrigued by Liam's words.

**Physical Attributes:** Dominika stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with striking features. Her piercing green eyes seem almost unnerving in their intensity, and her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night. Her skin has a smooth, golden undertone, likely due to her mixed Asian heritage.

**Interests:** As a seasoned thief and con artist, Dominika is drawn to high-stakes heists and intricate schemes. She takes great pleasure in outsmarting her marks and escaping with the loot. In addition, she appears to have an interest in staying informed about current events and social justice issues, particularly those related to corruption and financial inequality.

It's worth noting that Dominika seems to have a strong sense of independence and a willingness to take risks, which is evident in her decision to continue on her own path rather than joining forces with Liam's organization at first. However, she also shows signs of vulnerability and curiosity, particularly when it comes to Liam's words about Marcus Thompson and the secret organization he represents.
