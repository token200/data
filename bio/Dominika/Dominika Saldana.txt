Based on the inspiration from real-life actress Gina Rodriguez and her co-star Dominique Saldana's work, I've created a fictional character profile for Dominika Saldana:

**Name:** Dominika Saldana

**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)

**Eye Color:** Dark Brown

**Physical Attributes:** Dominika has long, curly dark brown hair and expressive brown eyes that seem to sparkle with warmth. Her features are striking, with high cheekbones, a small nose, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of dancing and physical activity.

**Personality:** Dominika is a free-spirited and creative individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to support them. Her outgoing personality makes her a natural people person, and she has a gift for making everyone feel seen and heard. Despite her bubbly demeanor, Dominika is also intensely focused and driven, with a strong work ethic that serves her well in her acting career.

**Interests:** When not on set or rehearsing lines, Dominika loves to dance (salsa, bachata, and hip-hop are her favorites) and try out new recipes in the kitchen. She's an avid reader of Latin American literature and poetry, and is always on the lookout for fresh inspiration from the world around her. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with loved ones, practicing yoga, and exploring the city to discover hidden gems.

Note: I've drawn inspiration from Gina Rodriguez and Dominique Saldana's profiles, but this is a fictional character created in their likeness.
