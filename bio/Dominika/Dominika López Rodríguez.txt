Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Dominika López Rodríguez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dominika seems to be an inquisitive and curious person, as evident from her decision to meet her estranged father despite her reservations. She is also emotional and empathetic, as she senses the complexity of her father's life through his eyes. Her willingness to confront her past and take the first step towards understanding her family's secrets shows that she is brave and determined.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no detailed description of Dominika's physical appearance in the short story. However, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Based on the fact that she stands out among a crowd of people and walks through busy streets, it's possible that Dominika is a bit taller than average, possibly around 5'7" to 5'10" (170 cm to 178 cm).
* Eye Color: The story describes her eyes as scanning the crowded station, but it doesn't provide any specific details about their color. Assuming she has brown or hazel eyes would be a reasonable guess.

**Interests:** Based on Dominika's actions and thoughts throughout the story, it can be inferred that she:

* Values honesty and openness: Her desire to understand her family's secrets and her initial skepticism towards meeting her father suggest that she is looking for truthfulness.
* Is interested in learning about others' lives: Her questions about her father's life and work show that she is curious about the people around her.
* May be drawn to art or culture (Barcelona): The fact that Dominika walks through the winding streets of Barcelona and feels a connection to the city suggests that she might have an appreciation for art, architecture, or cultural experiences.
