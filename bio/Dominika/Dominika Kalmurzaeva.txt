**Physical Attributes:**
Dominika stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a sleek and elegant manner, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are piercing green, a unique feature that sets her apart from others. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles on her cheeks, adding to her ethereal beauty.

Dominika is a complex and introspective person, driven by her passion for music. She's intensely focused and determined, with an unyielding dedication to her craft. Despite her prodigious talent, she struggles with self-doubt and feelings of isolation. Her past experiences have left emotional scars, making it challenging for her to form deep connections with others.

However, when faced with the right person (like Max), Dominika reveals a more vulnerable side. She's fiercely loyal, deeply empathetic, and willing to take risks to pursue her artistic vision. As she navigates her relationships and creative pursuits, Dominika balances her need for control with a growing desire to be seen and understood.

**Interests:**
Dominika is an accomplished musician with an innate love for classical music, but as she explores the world through Max's eyes, she begins to appreciate various art forms. She develops a passion for:

1. **Art Exhibitions:** Dominika becomes fascinated with contemporary art, exploring galleries and attending exhibitions. This newfound interest helps her see the world from different perspectives.
2. **Cuisine:** As she travels with Max, Dominika discovers a love for international cuisine. She experiments with new flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques, expanding her culinary horizons.
3. **City Exploration:** With Max as her companion, Dominika starts to explore the city on foot, discovering hidden gems and lesser-known landmarks. This newfound sense of freedom allows her to reconnect with nature and herself.

As Dominika's personal life deepens, her music becomes more raw, emotive, and powerful. She continues to play the violin with incredible skill, but now it's infused with a deeper sense of authenticity and vulnerability.
