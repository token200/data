**Personality:** 
Kato is a man shrouded in mystery, with an aura of quiet strength and depth that contrasts with his rough exterior. He exudes an air of caution and guardedness, but there are glimpses of vulnerability and understanding in his eyes that suggests he is capable of forming deep connections with others. He seems drawn to authenticity and shared passions, which makes him particularly receptive to Lena's open nature.

**Interests:**
