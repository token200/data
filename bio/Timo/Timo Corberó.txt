Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Timo Corberó:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Warm, rich hazel that seems to shimmer with golden undertones, reminiscent of the sun-kissed streets of Barcelona.
- Hair: Dark brown, with hints of auburn and a subtle wave that falls across his forehead when he's particularly focused on his art.

**Personality:**
Timo is an introspective yet outgoing individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He has a deep love for the city of Barcelona, its history, and its people, which he channels into his vibrant artwork. Timo is fiercely passionate about sharing his creative vision with others, often finding himself lost in conversations about art, culture, and life's big questions. Despite his growing confidence as an artist, he remains humble and grounded, crediting his grandmother's stories for sparking his own artistic journey.

**Interests:**
Timo is deeply connected to the world of art and creativity, spending hours exploring galleries, attending workshops, and collaborating with fellow artists. He also has a strong affection for traditional Catalan cuisine and often incorporates local flavors into his baked goods at his family's bakery below. On quieter evenings, Timo can be found practicing calligraphy or reading the works of Antoni Gaudí, as he seeks inspiration from the architectural masterpieces that dot Barcelona's landscape.

With this character profile, I've woven a fictional narrative around Timo Corberó, capturing the essence of his artistic spirit and personality in Barcelona.
