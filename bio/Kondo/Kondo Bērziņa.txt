Based on the provided short story about Kondija Bērziņa, I've created a fictional character profile for Kondo Bērziņa:

**Name:** Kondo Bērziņa

**Physical Attributes:**

- Skin Tone: Smooth, sun-kissed skin with a subtle scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.

**Personality:** Kondo is a gentle soul with an innate ability to connect with all living creatures. She possesses a soothing presence that calms even the most anxious or frightened animals, earning their trust and loyalty. Her compassion and empathy for others drive her to help those in need, making her a beloved figure in the village and beyond.

**Interests:**

* Animal behavior and welfare
