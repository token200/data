Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Kondo Mikhailov:

**Personality:** Kondo Mikhailov is a man shrouded in mystery with a quiet confidence that commands respect. He is a calculated individual who has honed his skills over years of living in the shadows as a former spy. Despite his efforts to leave his past behind, old habits die hard, and he still possesses sharp instincts that kick in when faced with a mysterious message or threat.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, often appearing almost unnervingly intense
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and impeccably
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a hint of scar tissue above his left eyebrow (indicative of past injuries or encounters)

**Interests:** As "Jack Harris," Kondo has taken up gardening and hiking as hobbies. However, given his background in espionage, it's likely that he also maintains a keen interest in surveillance, tactics, and counter-intelligence.

As Mikhailov, his interests may have been more focused on the world of espionage, including:

* Reading and staying informed about global politics and international relations
* Staying active in martial arts and self-defense techniques
* Collecting rare books or documents related to history, politics, or cryptography
