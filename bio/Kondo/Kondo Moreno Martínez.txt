As for how El Antiquario came into possession of the golden pendant, it's possible that he has a family history of collecting and trading in rare artifacts, or that he stumbled upon it during his travels through the Andes. Perhaps he was a former collector himself who sold some of his most prized possessions to fund his business, or maybe he acquired it from a fellow trader or collector who had lost their way.
