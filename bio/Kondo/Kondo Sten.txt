Here is a summary of Kondo Sten's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Kondo Sten is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, he appears to be a tough and rugged warrior, with a no-nonsense attitude that has earned him respect from his peers. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and longing for human connection. He is driven by a desire to protect others, particularly those in need, which sets him apart from the other mercenaries he works with.

Despite his tough exterior, Kondo Sten has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or wry at times, often using humor as a defense mechanism. However, once you gain his trust, he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to support those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:** Kondo Sten stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of combat training and fighting on the streets. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that seems almost otherworldly given his rugged demeanor. His hair is dark and short, often kept trimmed close to his head.

Kondo Sten's facial features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a strong jawline that speaks to his warrior background. He has a scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many battles, and a series of intricate tattoos on his arms and torso that reflect his clan heritage.

**Interests:** Kondo Sten's interests are varied, but primarily centered around combat, strategy, and self-improvement. As a skilled warrior, he is always looking to hone his skills and adapt to new situations, whether it's in the heat of battle or during downtime.

Despite his tough exterior, Kondo Sten has a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature, particularly works that explore themes of humanity and morality. He finds solace in these pursuits when he is not on a job, using them as a means to reflect on his own values and principles.

As he begins to question the ethics of his mercenary work and consider leaving his old life behind, Kondo Sten's interests are expanding to include more altruistic pursuits, such as helping those in need and exploring the concept of redemption.
