She has spent years accumulating wealth and knowledge, often at the expense of others and her own well-being. Her experiences have left emotional scars, evident in the scar above her left eyebrow from a heated negotiation.

However, as she grapples with the moral implications of collecting artifacts with questionable provenance, Abdirova is showing signs of growth and introspection. She is beginning to see the value in using her expertise for good, rather than just accumulating wealth.

As she begins to use her expertise for good, Abdirova's interests may expand to include issues of cultural heritage, repatriation, and the ethics of collecting and preserving artifacts. Her work will likely become more collaborative and less focused solely on personal accumulation, as she seeks to make amends for past mistakes and contribute meaningfully to the preservation of human history.
