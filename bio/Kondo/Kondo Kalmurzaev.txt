Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Kondo Kalmurzaev:

**Name:** Kondo Kalmurzaev (note: the name is inspired by the original character's last name, with a slight modification)

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Facial Structure: Angular features, prominent nose, and a scattering of light freckles across his cheeks

**Personality:** Kondo is an eccentric and brilliant mathematician who struggles with social interactions. He has a tendency to be blunt and tactless, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Despite this, he is driven by an insatiable curiosity for knowledge and is fiercely passionate about his work.

**Interests:**

* Mathematics (particularly probability theory)
* Reading and studying advanced texts on mathematics
* Experimenting with numbers and statistical models
* Solving complex mathematical problems
* Attending conferences and seminars to share his research

**Quirks:** Kondo has a habit of nodding enthusiastically when discussing complex ideas, often without fully comprehending the implications. He is also prone to scribbling notes on any available surface, whether it's a blackboard, chalkboard, or even the walls.

**Background:** Like the original character, Kondo hails from Moscow State University and has completed his Ph.D. in mathematics. After arriving at St. Petersburg University, he stumbles upon the small caf√© where he finds like-minded mathematicians who share his passion for probability theory.

Overall, Kondo Kalmurzaev is a unique blend of intellectual brilliance, awkward social interactions, and unrelenting dedication to his craft.
