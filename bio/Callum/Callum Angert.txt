Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Callum Angert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Callum Angert appears to be introverted, introspective, and emotionally guarded. He has struggled with feelings of loss, restlessness, and jadedness since his fight with his girlfriend. Despite this, he is capable of deep vulnerability and can form strong connections with those around him. His resilience and determination to face his challenges are evident in his willingness to seek help from his best friend Alex.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Callum's physical appearance. However, based on the description of his apartment as "small" and "cluttered," it can be inferred that he may have a somewhat disorganized or introverted exterior that mirrors his emotional state.

Given this lack of information, I will assume some general physical attributes that might fit with the character's personality:

* Height: 5'10"
* Eye Color: Blue-green (a color that suggests depth and introspection)
* Hair Color: Dark brown or auburn (a rich, earthy tone that complements his emotional complexity)

**Interests:** While we don't have extensive information about Callum's hobbies or interests, it can be inferred that he values deep conversations, meaningful relationships, and personal growth. He seems to appreciate the company of his friends and is willing to seek help from those around him when needed.

Some potential interests that might suit Callum's personality include:

* Reading (fiction or non-fiction) - This could suggest a love for self-reflection, exploration, and learning.
* Music (particularly indie or alternative genres) - This could indicate a more introspective and artistic side to his personality.
* Creative pursuits (writing, art, or photography) - This might reflect Callum's desire for expression and connection.

Keep in mind that these are speculative assumptions based on the provided short story.
