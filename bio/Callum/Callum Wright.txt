* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and neatly trimmed to accentuate his angular features

**Personality:**

* Quick-witted and sharp-tongued, often using humor to deflect attention from his true feelings
* Complex and introverted individual with a deep emotional life
* Has a tendency to put up walls around himself to protect others from getting too close
* Struggles to connect with others on a deeper level due to past experiences or anxiety

As an artist, Callum is drawn to exploring the human experience through color and texture. He finds solace in the creative process, using his art as a way to express and work through his emotions. As a person, he values authenticity, honesty, and vulnerability â€“ often taking risks to be himself, even if it means being vulnerable to rejection or criticism.

In contrast to his professional life as an event planner, Callum's artistic pursuits bring out a more sensitive and emotional side of him. He is no longer content with hiding behind his quick wit or polished exterior; instead, he allows himself to shine through in all aspects of his life, even if it means being seen as vulnerable or imperfect.
