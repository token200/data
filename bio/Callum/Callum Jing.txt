He is ruthless yet cunning, always staying one step ahead of his enemies by using his intelligence and experience to outmaneuver them. Despite his tough exterior, he has a calculating streak and can be fiercely loyal to those he trusts. However, he also has no qualms about betraying others if it serves his own interests.
