Background Information (to fill in missing details):
Callum grew up in a musical family, where music was an integral part of their lives. He began playing the guitar at a young age and later formed his own band, which gained popularity locally. When he discovered that his songs were being used without his consent, it shook him to his core and led to a crisis of confidence. Since then, he's been struggling to find inspiration and motivation in music again.

With Sarah's encouragement, Callum is once again finding the courage to create from a place of truth and authenticity, rather than external validation.
