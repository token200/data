Here's a summary of Callum Brown's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Callum appears to be a sensitive and emotional individual. He is fiercely independent and values his autonomy, as seen in his desire to move out of his family home and start a new life. However, this independence also makes him feel isolated and uncertain when faced with problems he can't solve on his own. He is prone to frustration and defeat when things don't go as planned, but is also willing to listen and apologize when he realizes the harm caused by his words.

Callum's emotional vulnerability is highlighted in his confrontation with Rachel, where he shows a deep-seated fear of failing and disappointing those around him. His willingness to accept help and support from Rachel demonstrates that he values relationships and is capable of seeking assistance when needed.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Skin Tone: Olive

The text doesn't provide explicit descriptions of Callum's physical attributes, but based on the narrative style and setting, it can be inferred that he is a young adult with a relatable, non-dramatic appearance. The description of his small, cluttered flat suggests that he may not prioritize material possessions or personal grooming.

**Interests:**

Callum's interests appear to revolve around career development, self-improvement, and personal growth. He has been working towards starting a new life in his own apartment, which indicates that he values independence and is willing to take risks to achieve his goals.

However, Callum also seems to enjoy spending time with family members, particularly Rachel, who provides emotional support during difficult times. His willingness to listen to her concerns and share his own problems suggests that he values meaningful relationships and is open to constructive feedback.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of Callum's interests or hobbies. Based on the narrative, it can be inferred that he may enjoy activities such as playing music (Rachel mentions laughter and shared stories), but more information would be needed to confirm this assumption.
