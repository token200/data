Given that the author emphasizes Callum's lightning-fast reflexes and razor-sharp instincts, it is reasonable to assume that he has a lean and athletic build, developed through years of gaming and physical activity. As for his eye color, bright blue fits with the description of "razor-sharp instincts," suggesting that he has exceptional focus and reaction time.
