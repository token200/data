Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Callum Sepp's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Callum Sepp appears to be a seasoned and skilled operative with a no-nonsense attitude. He is resourceful, intelligent, and physically capable, which allows him to excel in his role as a member of "The Rangers." However, the story also suggests that he may have some emotional scars from his past experiences as a soldier, as evidenced by his feeling of unease after completing the mission. This indicates that Callum is not invincible and may struggle with PTSD or other psychological effects related to his line of work.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
- Eye Color: Brown
- Hair Color: Dark Blonde

The story does not provide any information on Callum's height, so I have assumed it to be average for a male of his age group. His eye color is also brown, whereas the description of Nightshade's eyes as "piercing blue" suggests that Callum's eye color may actually be blue or at least have some blue undertones.

**Interests:**

Based on the story, it appears that Callum has a deep affinity for nature and the wilderness. As a former soldier who finds solace in the vast expanse and silence of the forest, it seems that he values solitude and the peace that comes with being surrounded by nature. This could be an indication that Callum is drawn to more contemplative pursuits or may be someone who relies on his mental toughness as much as physical strength.

It's also possible that his military background and experience as a member of "The Rangers" have shaped his interest in tactics, surveillance, and infiltration techniques. His work with the team suggests a deep-seated passion for strategy and problem-solving.

However, due to the limited information provided about Callum's interests beyond his work as a Ranger, these points are speculative and may not be entirely accurate.
