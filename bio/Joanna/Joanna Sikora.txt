Here's a summary of Joanna Sikora's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Joanna is a slender woman with a height of around 5'8" (173 cm). Her eye color is a bright blue, almost cerulean in hue. She has long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a cascade of chestnut waves. Her skin tone is a warm, golden brown, hinting at her Polish heritage.

**Personality:** Joanna is a book-smart, introspective person with a dry sense of humor. As a historian, she's meticulous and analytical, but she also has a deep love for storytelling and the arts. She's a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes make her come across as introverted or reserved to those who don't know her. However, once you get to know Joanna, she's warm, witty, and has a quick smile that puts people at ease.

**Interests:** Joanna is passionate about history, culture, language, and literature. She's an expert in Eastern European studies and has spent years researching the intricacies of Polish history and customs. In her free time, she enjoys reading classic literature (especially 19th-century German authors), writing short stories, and exploring the city's hidden corners. Joanna is also a keen observer of people and cultures, always eager to learn more about the world around her.

As someone who has spent years studying Krakow's history, Joanna has developed a deep appreciation for its cultural heritage and is thrilled to be immersed in it firsthand. Her trip is as much about self-discovery as it is about cultural exploration, and she's excited to see how this journey will shape her identity and worldview.
