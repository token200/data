Based on the short story, here is a summary of Joanna Sánchez Pérez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Joanna is a determined and passionate individual who is driven by her desire to tell the truth and bring about justice. She is also deeply empathetic and compassionate, as evident from her ability to connect with Rafael and amplify his voice. Her experience growing up in a small town in Mexico and learning from her abuela's stories has instilled in her a strong sense of community and cultural heritage.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Age: 25
* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almond-shaped eyes that reflect her Mexican heritage.
* Hair Color: Black, curly hair that falls down her back like a waterfall.
* Build: Slender and athletic, with a wiry physique honed from years of walking long distances in the streets of Guadalajara.

**Interests:** Joanna is deeply interested in storytelling, journalism, and social justice. She is passionate about shedding light on issues affecting marginalized communities, particularly rural women farmers. Her work is driven by a desire to amplify their voices and bring about change. In her free time, she enjoys exploring the streets of Guadalajara, trying new foods, and listening to traditional Mexican music.

It's worth noting that there are some gaps in the original story, such as Joanna's height and eye color being fully specified, so I made educated guesses based on common characteristics associated with people from Mexico.
