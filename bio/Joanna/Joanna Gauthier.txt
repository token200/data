**Personality:** Joanna appears to be a driven and passionate art historian with a strong sense of determination. She has a skeptical streak, as evident from her initial hesitation when Léon shares his discovery. However, as the conversation progresses, her reserve crumbles, revealing a more curious and open-minded individual. Her intensity and focus suggest that she is highly dedicated to her work.

She might have curly brown hair (a common choice for art historians) and hazel eyes, although these details are not explicitly mentioned. Her height is not specified, but based on the description of Léon's worn denim jacket and scuffed boots, she may be slightly shorter than him.

**Interests:** As a renowned art historian, Joanna's primary interest is in studying and analyzing the works of Claude Monet, particularly his water lily series. She likely has a deep passion for understanding the historical context and artistic innovations that led to Monet's groundbreaking paintings.
