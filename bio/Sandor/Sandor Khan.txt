Here is a summary of Sandor Khan's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sandor Khan stands at approximately 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a ruggedly athletic build that speaks to his years spent on motorcycles. His piercing eyes are an intense blue-gray color, which seems to bore into those he meets, as if searching for secrets or hidden truths. His dark hair is often unkempt and flecked with gray, giving him a weathered, seasoned look.

**Personality:** Despite his fearsome exterior, Sandor has a complex and multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears brooding and introverted, with a dry sense of humor that can be intimidating to those who don't know him. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deeply emotional and empathetic individual, who is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. Sandor has a rich inner life, which he only begins to reveal to Lily as they grow closer.

**Interests:** Sandor's true passion in life is repairing old motorcycles in his cluttered workshop. He finds solace in the intricate world of engines and transmissions, where he can lose himself for hours in a sea of grease and gasoline. This sanctuary allows him to escape the chaos of his past and recharge for the future. When not tinkering with engines, Sandor enjoys listening to classic rock music and reading about the history of motorcycle culture.

As a former member of the Red Vipers, Sandor also has a deep appreciation for motorcycles and the thrill of high-speed chases, which he occasionally engages in for fun. However, these activities are now few and far between, replaced by more low-key pursuits with Lily that bring him a sense of peace and contentment.

Overall, Sandor is a man torn between two worlds: his past as a feared enforcer of the Red Vipers, and his newfound life with Lily, where he is slowly shedding the mantle of his former identity.
