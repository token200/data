Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Sandor Chun-yi:

**Physical Attributes:** Sandor Chun-yi stands at an unassuming 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to see right through you. His dark hair is often unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face with a hint of roughness. He has a strong jawline and a small nose, giving him an air of quiet confidence.

**Personality:** Sandor is an enigmatic individual, often lost in thought as he navigates the world around him. Despite his mastery of the erhu, he remains humble and introverted, preferring to keep to himself rather than seeking attention from others. This reserved nature stems from a childhood spent traveling with his family's nomadic performances, leaving him with a sense of detachment from the world. However, when he finds someone who understands and connects with him on a deep level, such as Luna, Sandor's reserve crumbles, revealing a tender and loving heart.

**Interests:** Sandor is deeply passionate about traditional folk music, particularly the erhu, which has become an extension of himself. He spends hours practicing and perfecting his craft, seeking to master new techniques and push the boundaries of what is possible on the instrument. Music is not just a source of entertainment for Sandor; it's a way for him to connect with the world around him, to convey emotions and thoughts that words cannot express.

In addition to music, Sandor has a fascination with the mysteries of life, often finding himself lost in thought as he wanders through villages or watches the stars at night. He is drawn to the beauty and tranquility of nature, which seems to resonate with his own inner world. When paired with Luna's presence in his life, these interests are reignited, and Sandor finds a sense of purpose and belonging that he had been searching for his entire life.
