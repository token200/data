Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Sandor Kazuo:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue (a striking contrast to Emiko's piercing green eyes)

Sandor has an athletic build, honed from years of rigorous training as a former operative. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up and assessing their intentions.

**Personality:**

* Introverted and reserved, Sandor initially presents himself as aloof and detached, using his charisma and wit to deflect emotional connections.
* However, beneath this facade lies a complex and vulnerable individual who has spent years honing his skills in the art of espionage and deception.
* As he opens up to Emiko, Sandor reveals a deep sense of loyalty and trust, having been burned by past betrayals.
* He is fiercely independent and self-reliant, but also values honesty and authenticity, which are qualities he finds attractive in Emiko.

**Interests:**

* Martial arts and hand-to-hand combat (a skillset honed during his time as an operative)
* Strategic planning and problem-solving (Sandor excels at analyzing situations and finding creative solutions)
* Surveillance and reconnaissance (he has spent years perfecting the art of gathering intel without being detected)
* Music (specifically, classical music, which provides a calming respite from the stresses of his work)

Despite his tough exterior, Sandor has a rich inner life and a deep appreciation for the finer things in life. He is a man of contrasts: physically imposing yet emotionally vulnerable, cerebral yet intuitive. As he navigates his relationship with Emiko, Sandor must confront his own demons and learn to trust himself and others once more.
