**Personality:** Sandor is a complex character with a mix of guilt, shame, and determination. He has a deep-seated sense of responsibility for his past actions, which drives him to make amends and seek redemption. Despite his troubled history, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, as evident in his willingness to work with Luisa Garcia, his former accomplice-turned-ally. Sandor's reserved nature is likely a coping mechanism, allowing him to navigate the darker aspects of his life.
