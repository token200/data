Based on the short story provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Sandor Marcuzzi:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets
- Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, slightly unkempt manner
- Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a wiry physique

**Personality:**
Sandor Marcuzzi is a brilliant and resourceful detective with a sharp mind and quick wit. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority when he believes it's necessary to get to the truth. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side and a strong sense of justice, which drives him to uncover corruption and protect the innocent.

**Interests:**
- Sandor is an avid reader, devouring books on true crime, psychology, and philosophy in his spare time.
- He's also an avid hiker and enjoys exploring the outdoors, often using these experiences to clear his mind and gather new insights for cases.
- As a keen observer of human behavior, he has a fascination with sociology and criminology, constantly seeking to learn more about the motivations and actions of those around him.

**Other Details:**
Sandor has a distinctive habit of tapping his pen or fingers on surfaces when deep in thought, a quirk that can sometimes be seen as annoying by those who don't know him. He's also been known to carry a small notebook and pencil with him at all times, jotting down notes and ideas as they come to him.
