Here is a summary of the fictional character Sandor Askarov:

**Physical Attributes:** Sandor Askarov stands at 6'2" with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing emerald green eyes, inherited from his magical lineage, seem to hold a deep intensity and wisdom beyond his years. His dark brown hair is often impeccably styled, framing his chiseled features and sharp jawline.

**Personality:** Sandor's personality has undergone significant transformation since his indoctrination into Lady Arachne's inner circle. Initially, he was driven by ambition and a desire for power, which led him to align himself with the ruthless sorceress. However, beneath the surface of his obedience lies a complex and conflicted individual. A lingering spark of his former self continues to flicker, hinting at a deep sense of morality and justice. Despite this, he remains calculating and detached, using his wit and cunning to navigate the treacherous landscape of Lady Arachne's world.

**Interests:** As a young man, Sandor was deeply fascinated by the world of high-stakes magic, devouring ancient texts and practicing spells in secret. His passion for magic has not entirely dissipated, but it now serves as a means to an end, fueling his ambition and sense of purpose within Lady Arachne's inner circle. Outside of his magical pursuits, Sandor is likely drawn to strategic games of chess or other intellectual challenges that test his mental acuity.

It is worth noting that the transformation in Sandor Askarov's personality has been driven by his indoctrination into Lady Arachne's inner circle and the intense emotional manipulation he underwent during this time.
