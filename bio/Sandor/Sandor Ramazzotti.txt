Here's a summary of the fictional character Sandor Ramazzotti:

**Physical Attributes:** Sandor is a tall and muscular man, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a robust build. His piercing green eyes seem to gleam with intensity, and his dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, rugged fashion that adds to his tough persona. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his early fighting days.

**Personality:** Sandor is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a mix of rough-around-the-edges toughness and underlying vulnerability. As "The Bull," he exudes confidence and an aura of invincibility, but as a person, he's driven by a deep sense of loyalty and responsibility to his family. Despite his success in the arena, Sandor remains humble and grounded, always keeping his roots firmly connected to his family back home.

**Interests:** When not fighting or training, Sandor enjoys spending time with his loved ones and listening to traditional Italian folk music on his lute. He's also a bit of a foodie and has a weakness for authentic Roman cuisine, particularly when it comes to homemade pasta and pizza. Outside the arena, he's fiercely dedicated to supporting his family financially and finding ways to use his winnings to make a positive impact in Rome.

As The Bull, Sandor is always prepared for battle, but as an individual, he's driven by a desire to protect those he cares about and make a difference in the world beyond the gladiatorial arena.
