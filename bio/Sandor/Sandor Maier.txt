Based on the short story, here is a summary of Sandor Maier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sandor Maier appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. As a skilled apothecary, she is focused on her mission to create a new remedy for the Fever of the Golden Sun, and her interactions with vendors and others suggest that she is not afraid to negotiate or assert herself when necessary. However, as she watches Rachel's performance, we see a more contemplative side to Sandor, indicating that she values creativity, beauty, and perhaps even emotional connection.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (172 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a practical braid or ponytail to keep it out of her face while working
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of walking long distances and lifting heavy cauldrons

**Interests:** Sandor's interests seem to be centered around her work as an apothecary and her membership in the Order of the Silver Stag. She is clearly passionate about mastering the art of potion-making and uncovering the secrets of ancient knowledge, which drives her quest for a cure for the Fever of the Golden Sun.

However, we also glimpse other interests through her interactions with Rachel and the music performance:

* Appreciation for beauty and creativity (as evident in her praise of Rachel's flute playing)
* Connection to her childhood friend and community (in her warm conversation with Rachel)
* Appreciation for music and performance (in her presence at the gathering)

It is possible that Sandor has other interests outside of her work, but these are not explicitly stated in the provided text.
