**Background:**
Nagasaki Wei-lun was born in a small town in Taiwan to a family of modest means. Growing up with a love for the sea and adventure, she began studying martial arts at a young age and quickly became skilled in various techniques. As she grew older, her fascination with naval warfare led her to study the ancient art of ship design and navigation. Wei-lun eventually set sail on her own, exploring the world's oceans and learning from the masters of the sea. Her travels took her to Nagasaki, where she met fellow adventurers and scholars who shared her passions. Together, they formed a network of explorers and innovators who pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and innovation.

This profile is inspired by Kaito in the original story but adapted to fit a female protagonist with a unique Taiwanese background.
