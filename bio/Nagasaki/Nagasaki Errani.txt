**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - slightly above average height, with an athletic build that is lean and toned.
* Eye Color: A deep, piercing brown that seems to hold a world of wisdom within it. The eyes are almond-shaped, with a subtle upward tilt at the outer corners, giving Errani an enigmatic and mystical appearance.

**Personality:**

* Errani is a deeply introspective and empathetic individual who possesses a profound understanding of the natural world and its rhythms.
* He is calm, centered, and patient, with a quiet strength that allows him to navigate even the most turbulent of situations.

* He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, and will go to great lengths to protect and guide them.

**Interests:**

* Nature and spirituality are at the heart of Errani's being. He spends countless hours communing with the spirits of the land, seeking guidance and wisdom from the ancient trees and desert canyons.
* He is a skilled herbalist and healer, using his knowledge of plants and natural remedies to help those in need.
* Music is another passion of Errani's, and he often plays the traditional instruments of his Order, weaving sonic tapestries that seem to transport listeners to otherworldly realms.

**Other Details:**

* Errani has a distinctive silver pendant bearing the symbol of the White Rose around his neck, which holds significant spiritual meaning for him.
* His feet are usually bare, reflecting his connection to the earth and his ability to sense the subtle vibrations of the natural world.
