Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Mireille Krūmiņš' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mireille is a complex and introspective individual. She is haunted by her past and struggles with feelings of disconnection from her Latvian heritage. Despite this, she has a deep love for art, music, and freedom. Mireille is a creative person who finds solace in her painting, but also feels the weight of it as a distraction from her true emotions.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)
- **Eye Color:** Dark brown
- **Hair Color and Style:** Long, dark hair that falls down her back like a waterfall

Mireille's physical appearance is understated yet elegant. Her long hair cascades down her back like a rich, dark veil, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an expressive shade of dark brown that seem to hold the weight of her secrets.

**Interests:** Mireille is passionate about art and music, which she inherited from her grandmother. She finds solace in painting as a means to express herself and cope with her emotions. The two are deeply connected to her Latvian heritage, which has become a source of pain for her but also holds memories of her family's struggles against the Soviet occupation.

However, given the narrative it appears that Mireille might be interested in exploring her Latvian heritage as a reminder of strength and resilience rather than being held back by it.
