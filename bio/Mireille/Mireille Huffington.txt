I'd be happy to help you create a fictional character profile for Mireille Huffington. Since there is no inspiration from Arianna Huffington's real-life personality, I'll take the opportunity to introduce a new and unique character.

Here's a summary of Mireille Huffington:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel with golden undertones
- Hair: Dark brown, wavy, and shoulder-length
- Skin Tone: Medium olive

**Personality:**
Mireille is a charismatic and introspective individual. She has a deep understanding of human psychology, which she gained through her years of studying philosophy and sociology. Mireille is compassionate, empathetic, and has a strong sense of justice. Her natural leadership qualities and strategic thinking make her an effective problem-solver and team player.

However, Mireille also struggles with self-doubt and imposter syndrome at times, stemming from her tendency to overthink and second-guess herself. Despite this, she is fiercely determined and will not back down when faced with challenges or obstacles.

**Interests:**
Mireille is a passionate advocate for social justice and human rights. She's particularly interested in education and community development programs that empower marginalized groups. In her free time, Mireille enjoys practicing yoga, reading philosophy texts, and experimenting with traditional Mediterranean cuisine.
