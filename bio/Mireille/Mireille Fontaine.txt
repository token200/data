**Personality:** Mireille appears to be introspective and nostalgic, often lost in thought as she navigates familiar surroundings. Her past experiences have likely left emotional scars, and her curiosity is piqued by mysterious messages and encounters. She seems determined and willing to confront her destiny, but also guarded about revealing the truth.

- **Eye Color:** The short story does not specify the eye color of the protagonist, so we cannot definitively say what it is. However, based on her age and background in a French town named Saint-Pierre, she could be perceived to have blue eyes due to the typical eye colors commonly found among individuals from this part of the world.

- **Hair Color:** The text does not mention Mireille's hair color, but for simplicity and consistency with her French heritage, it might be depicted as dark brown or blonde.

Mireille seems to appreciate nostalgia, storytelling, and personal introspection. Her affinity for writing ("the pen was mightier than any sword") suggests that she has an interest in creative expression and communication. Her encounters also imply a curiosity about the world beyond her hometown and possibly a desire for connection with others who understand her experiences.
