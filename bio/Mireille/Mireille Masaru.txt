Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Mireille Masaru:

She has a fit and toned physique, honed from years of physical activity while chasing down leads and interviewing sources.

Her sharp instincts and tenacious nature make her a powerful advocate for truth and justice.

**Interests:**
Mireille Masaru's interests are centered around investigation, research, and uncovering hidden truths. She is an avid reader and researcher, devouring books on history, economics, and politics to gain a deeper understanding of the complex systems she covers in her reporting.
