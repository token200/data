Here's a summary of Mireille Keiko's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Mireille is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, she appears to be confident and poised as a geisha, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability. She struggles with the moral implications of her profession as a mistress, particularly when it involves compromising her values and autonomy. Despite this, Mireille is also determined and resilient, willing to take risks to pursue her goals and maintain her dignity.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: Mireille is slender and elegant, standing at around 5'4" (162 cm).
* Eye Color: Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which adds to her exotic and enigmatic presence.
* Hair Color and Style: Her hair is long and black, typically styled in the traditional geisha updo or adorned with intricate pins and ornaments.

**Interests:** 

* Traditional Japanese culture (e.g., tea ceremonies, incense appreciation)
* Nature and the outdoors (cricket sounds, scents of incense)
* Geisha traditions and etiquette
* Music and dance ( likely including traditional Japanese instruments and performances)
* Personal relationships and quiet conversations with her fellow geishas

It's worth noting that Mireille's experiences as a geisha are deeply rooted in Japanese culture, which may not be immediately apparent to those outside of the geisha community. Her interests and values reflect this cultural context, and she is likely deeply familiar with the customs and traditions of Kyoto and other parts of Japan.

In contrast, her experience working as a mistress in Tokyo introduces an element of modernity and disconnection from traditional Japanese culture. This tension between old and new, tradition and modernity, contributes to Mireille's sense of confusion and longing for home.
