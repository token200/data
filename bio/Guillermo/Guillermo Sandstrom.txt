**Physical Attributes:** Gus is described as a tall man with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair that falls to his shoulders. He wears glasses perched on the end of his nose, giving him a studious and bookish appearance that fits well with his profession as a librarian.

**Interests:** Gus's interests are rooted in literature, art, and music, which suggests that he values creativity and intellectual pursuits.
