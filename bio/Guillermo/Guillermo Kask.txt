Physical Attributes: Guillermo stands at approximately 6'1" with an athletic build, hinting at his former life as a spy. His piercing eyes are a deep shade of blue that seems almost hypnotic, allowing him to see right through people. His rugged features and sharp jawline add to his mysterious persona.

Personality: Guillermo has a complex personality - on the surface, he appears tough and unapproachable, with a face that can "melt steel." However, beneath this exterior lies a compassionate and empathetic individual who takes in strays and underdogs. He has a soft spot for those in need, as evident from his relationship with Max, the scrappy little terrier.

1. Chess: Guillermo is an avid chess player who spends hours playing with the town's elderly residents.
2. Solitude: As someone who has spent years in the shadows, Guillermo finds solace in the silence and quiet moments.
3. Helping others: His work as a CIA agent taught him the value of protecting those in need, which drives his actions even after retirement.
4. Travel: Although Guillermo prefers to keep a low profile, there's an implication that he enjoys exploring new places and experiencing different worlds.

Background (as described in the short story): After retiring from the CIA, Guillermo moved to Ravenswood, where he runs a humble caf√©. The town has become his sanctuary, providing him with opportunities to connect with the locals and use his skills for good. Despite his mysterious past, Guillermo's love for strays, underdogs, and those in need remains constant, making him a guardian figure in the community.
