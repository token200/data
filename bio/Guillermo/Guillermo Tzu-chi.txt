- Height: 6'4" (193 cm) - making G-Tz an exceptionally tall and lanky individual.
- Eye Color: Hazel eyes with golden flecks that seem to sparkle with inner light when he is using his healing techniques.

**Personality:**
G-Tz's personality is marked by his compassion, empathy, and generosity. He is a selfless individual who puts the needs of others before his own. His calm and centered demeanor makes him an approachable figure, even in the midst of chaos or adversity. He is deeply committed to the principles of Tzu-chi and uses his knowledge to help those in need.
