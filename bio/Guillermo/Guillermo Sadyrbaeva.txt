**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm), lean yet athletic build
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost an electric shade that seems to gleam with intensity when he's on a mission or feeling confident.
- Hair: Dark blond, often slicked back to reveal his angular face and prominent cheekbones.
- Facial Features: High cheekbones, sharp jawline, and a small scar above the left eyebrow from a past scrape.

**Personality:** 
Guillermo is charismatic, intelligent, and utterly self-assured - traits that make him an effective operative in high-stakes missions. He's quick-witted, always thinking several steps ahead, with a dry sense of humor that he saves for moments like those after retrieving the artifact when he can finally relax.

**Interests:**
Guillermo has an unrelenting passion for extreme sports and martial arts. When not working on high-risk jobs or planning his next move, he's been known to indulge in activities like skydiving, rock climbing, or street fighting as a form of catharsis.

Despite his tough exterior, Guillermo seems to have a curious side, always looking to learn more about the underworld and its various machinations. His professional background has also led him to develop an interest in geopolitics, often studying the rival corporation he infiltrated for clues on their organization's inner workings.

It is worth noting that despite his rough exterior, Guillermo possesses an innate sense of honor and principle, guiding his actions both on and off the job. He takes pride in being a professional who does not bend to personal interests but rather prioritizes results over personal gain whenever possible.
