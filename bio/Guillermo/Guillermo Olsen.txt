Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Guillermo Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Guillermo Olsen is described as someone who has a "passion for music that knew no bounds" and remains humble despite achieving stardom. He is dedicated to his craft and inspired others with his dedication to his art. His humility and groundedness have allowed him to stay connected to his community, using his platform to give back.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown

While the story doesn't provide extensive details on Guillermo's physical appearance beyond eye color and height, it does convey a strong sense of his inner drive and humility. 

The only physical detail mentioned is eye color - dark brown, which suggests that he may have a more exotic or South American look given that samba rhythms originated in Brazil.

It's worth noting, though, that there are other details about him provided through the context of his music, such as the fact that Brazilian musicians were among those he studied with. However, these do not describe any physical attributes but rather his connections to others in a professional setting.
