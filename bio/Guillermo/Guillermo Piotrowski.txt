Guillermo Piotrowski stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an unassuming presence. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly and trimmed short, framing his face. His eyes are a deep shade of hazel, almost brown with golden flecks, which seem to hold a quiet intensity behind them.

Despite this, he has a rich inner world of creativity and passion that drives him to create breathtaking works of art. He is humble and grounded, crediting his talent to the beauty he finds in everyday life. This unassuming demeanor allows him to connect with people on a deeper level, as if he's able to tap into their own inner worlds.

**Interests:**
Guillermo Piotrowski is deeply fascinated by patterns found in nature - from the intricate veins of leaves to the swirling clouds and delicate curves of flowers. These natural forms inspire his art, which often blends realism with fantasy elements. He finds solace in observation and contemplation, often spending hours sketching or observing the world around him. When not creating art, Guillermo Piotrowski enjoys music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which he finds hauntingly beautiful and emotive.

After discovering an old piano in a local park, Guillermo Piotrowski was inspired to explore the connection between music and art. He has since created a new series of works that reflect the melancholic melody of the piano, using light and shadow to bring the instrument to life on canvas.
