Here is a summary of the fictional character Guillermo Fontaine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean, with a wiry strength from years of manual labor

**Personality:**

* Guillermo is a complex, introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a tendency to guard his past and emotions closely, but once you gain his trust, he opens up and reveals his depth.
* He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. This independence was cultivated during his life as a thief, where he had to rely solely on himself to survive.
* Despite his tough exterior, Guillermo has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand (or wrench) to others.

**Interests:**

* Fixing machines and engines, which he finds therapeutic and fulfilling
* Restoring classic motorcycles, particularly the battered old one that started it all
* Reading and learning new skills, often in the dead of night when no one is looking
* Hiding from his past, but slowly beginning to confront and make amends for his mistakes

Guillermo's life has been marked by a series of stolen moments, broken dreams, and shattered relationships. Yet, with Maria's arrival, he finds himself drawn into a new world of possibility and connection. His story is one of redemption, forgiveness, and the power of human connection to heal even the deepest wounds.
