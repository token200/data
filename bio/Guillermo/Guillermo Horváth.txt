Here is a summary of Guillermo Horváth's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Guillermo is an introverted and book-loving individual who finds solace in the written word. He has a deep appreciation for literature and history, which stems from his upbringing under Oldřich's guidance at the bookshop. Despite struggling with anxiety and depression, Guillermo seems to have found a sense of escape and possibility through his love of books.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Guillermo is likely around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, allowing him to move comfortably through the crowded streets of Prague.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a warm brown color that seem to light up with excitement when he talks about literature or discovers new works by authors he admires.

**Interests:** Guillermo's passions include:
	+ Literature, particularly Czech authors and modernist movements
	+ History, especially the cultural and literary history of Czech Republic
	+ Researching and writing papers on his favorite topics
	+ Reading (obviously!), often getting lost in the world of books for hours on end
	+ Learning about new cultures and ideas through literature and other sources

Additionally, Guillermo's love of Kafka is evident, and he may have a particular fondness for exploring the philosophical and psychological themes present in his works.
