**Personality:** Guillermo is a complex and multi-faceted individual. As "The Bull," he exudes confidence, bravery, and an unwavering commitment to justice.

However, as his mild-mannered alter ego, Guillermo is more reserved, preferring the anonymity of everyday life.

**Physical Attributes:** Guillermo stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into those he encounters, conveying an unyielding intensity.

1. **Reading**: He devours books on criminology, psychology, and philosophy, seeking to deepen his understanding of human nature and tactics.
2. **Gym work-out**: Regular exercise helps him maintain a peak physical condition, both mentally and physically.

4. **Collecting intel**: He has a fascination with urban legends, mythologies, and folklore, which often helps him connect seemingly unrelated dots.

Guillermo's interests are closely tied to his pursuit of justice and his ongoing quest for knowledge about the dark underbelly of society.

Overall, Guillermo Petersen is a complex, driven individual who navigates two distinct worlds: that of a mild-mannered accountant by day, and The Bull, a fearless vigilante by night.
