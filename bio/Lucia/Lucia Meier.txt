Here's a summary of Lucia Meier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Lucia is a petite woman with a slender build. Her height is approximately 5'2" (157 cm), which makes her even more elusive and mysterious. Her eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purple in color, which seems to draw people in and captivate their attention. Her hair is dark brown and often falls in loose waves down her back.

**Personality:** Lucia's personality is as enigmatic as her art. Despite being a recluse, she exudes an air of confidence and authority that commands respect. She is fiercely protective of her art and only shares it with those she trusts implicitly. Her introverted nature makes it difficult for people to get close to her, but once you've gained her trust, you'll discover a kindred spirit who is deeply passionate about her craft.

**Interests:** Lucia's passions lie in the realm of art, music, and poetry. She is an avid collector of rare books on philosophy and psychology, which fuel her creative output. Her favorite authors include Edgar Allan Poe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sylvia Plath, whose works resonate with her own introspective nature. Music plays a significant role in her artistic process as well; she often listens to classical music by Chopin or Debussy while working on a new piece.

Lucia is also deeply interested in the concept of the "inner self" and how it relates to creativity. She believes that art is an extension of one's soul, and that true inspiration comes from within. Her studio is filled with symbols, talismans, and personal mementos that represent her inner world, making it a testament to her unique perspective on life.

In short, Lucia Meier is a multifaceted individual whose reclusive nature belies a deep well of creativity, passion, and introspection.
