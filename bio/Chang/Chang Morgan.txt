Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Chang Morgan:

**Personality:** Chang Morgan is a complex and enigmatic figure with a reputation for being untouchable. He exudes quiet confidence, but also has an air of mystery that makes it difficult to pin down his true nature. Despite this, he seems to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by the glint in his eye when he chuckles. He appears to be highly intelligent and calculating, able to think several steps ahead of those around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Chang is tall and lean, with chiseled features that give off an air of quiet confidence. His most distinctive feature is his piercing green eyes, which seem to see right through you. His hair is dark and unkempt, framing his angular face. He has a sharp jawline and high cheekbones, giving him a striking presence.

**Interests:** It's not clear what Chang's interests are, but it can be inferred that he enjoys the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of outsmarting those around him. As a master thief or operative, he likely enjoys the intellectual challenge of planning and executing complex heists. He may also have an interest in art, given the rumors surrounding his past exploits (some claimed he had a talent for forgery).

However, one thing is clear: Chang Morgan is not someone who can be easily trusted or relied upon. His interests seem to center around maintaining control and power, using his intelligence and cunning to keep others at arm's length.

It's also worth noting that, despite being portrayed as an elusive figure, Chang appears to have a dry sense of humor and a tendency to challenge those who try to write his story. He seems to enjoy pushing people's buttons and testing their resolve, making him a formidable opponent in both the world of high-stakes thievery and journalism.
