Here is a summary of Chang Klein's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Chang Klein is a sharp-witted and confident detective with a wry sense of humor. He has a no-nonsense attitude and can come across as aloof or dismissive to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a dry wit and a deep passion for solving puzzles and uncovering the truth. Chang is fiercely independent and values his autonomy, often taking on cases that challenge the conventional wisdom of the authorities.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
Chang has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of walking the streets of Tokyo. His sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones give him a chiseled appearance, accentuated by his short, dark hair.

**Interests:**
In addition to his work as a detective, Chang is an avid enthusiast of Japanese culture, particularly martial arts (he holds a black belt in karate) and traditional tea ceremonies. He has a fondness for fine whiskey and appreciates the complexities of Tokyo's vibrant nightlife scene. In his rare moments of downtime, Chang enjoys reading classical literature (especially Japanese poetry) and playing chess.

When not solving cases or sipping whiskey, Chang is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak louder than any verbal explanation. His love for mystery and puzzle-solving drives him forward, whether it's chasing down leads in the city streets or unraveling the threads of a complex crime scene.
