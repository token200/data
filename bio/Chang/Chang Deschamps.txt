Based on the short story, here is a summary of Chang Deschamps' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chang Deschamps appears to be a complex individual with a mysterious past as a former thief and con artist. He has turned his life around after serving time in prison and now works as a private investigator. Deschamps is likely resourceful, intelligent, and skilled at navigating the underworld of Shanghai. However, he also seems cautious and skeptical, especially when it comes to Lian's motives. His determination to uncover the truth behind the missing girl suggests that he has a strong sense of justice and is willing to take risks to protect those in need.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Deschamps is likely of average height, perhaps around 5'9" (175 cm), considering his age and profession.
* Eye Color: His piercing blue eyes seem to be an unusual feature for someone with a rough past. They may be a sign of his refined or sensitive side, which he has managed to hide behind his tough exterior.
* Build: As a former con artist, Deschamps might have a leaner build, but it's unclear how physically fit he is.

**Interests:** Based on the story, we can infer that Deschamps' interests include:

* Investigating and solving mysteries
* Uncovering hidden truths and secrets
* Helping those in need, particularly those who are vulnerable or exploited
* Understanding the complexities of the human psyche and behavior

However, his involvement with Lian and her underworld connections suggests that he may also have a fascination with the darker side of life, which could be a driving force for his investigations.
