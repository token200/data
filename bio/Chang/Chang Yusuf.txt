Here is a summary of Chang Yusuf's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Chang Yusuf is charismatic and confident, with a charming smile that draws attention from those around him. He is also cunning and resourceful, able to think on his feet and stay one step ahead of his pursuers. Despite his reputation as a master thief, he has a sense of pride and satisfaction that comes from completing a successful heist.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green, a trait that seems almost otherworldly given his mysterious background
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a way that frames his face and accentuates his features

**Interests:** Chang Yusuf is deeply passionate about his craft as a thief. He takes great pride in the thrill of the heist, the challenge of staying one step ahead of his adversaries, and the satisfaction of pulling off a successful job. Outside of his work, he seems to enjoy the finer things in life - luxurious clothing, rare artifacts, and exotic destinations.

It's worth noting that Chang Yusuf's past is shrouded in mystery, and much about his childhood and early life remains unknown. However, based on his current exploits and persona, it appears that he is driven by a sense of self-preservation and a desire for freedom, which fuels his actions as a thief.

As an added detail, I imagine Chang Yusuf to have a fondness for poetry, particularly the works of Ottoman poets like Fuzuli or Sadi. His choice of name, "Chang Yusuf", suggests a connection to this literary heritage, and it's possible that he finds inspiration in the words and themes of these great masters.
