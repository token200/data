He's also an avid collector of rare books and manuscripts, which he often uses to gather information or distract from his true intentions.

**Additional Details:** Chang Bonnet has no known family members, having grown up on the streets with no parental support. As a result, he's learned to rely solely on himself and his wits to survive.

Despite his tough past, Chang Bonnet has a deep sense of vulnerability and empathy, particularly when it comes to those who have been wronged by the system.
