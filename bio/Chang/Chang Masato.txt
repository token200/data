Here is a summary of Chang Masato's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chang Masato appears to be a private investigator with a dry sense of humor and an air of skepticism. He seems like an outcast among his peers, likely due to his worn leather jacket and rough-around-the-edges demeanor. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that he is fiercely determined and driven by a desire for truth and justice. His past experiences have left emotional scars, but they also seem to fuel his determination to uncover the secrets hidden beneath the surface of Tokyo.

**Physical Attributes:** Chang Masato's physical attributes are not fully described in the original text, so I will fill in some details:

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - a lean and athletic build suggests he is comfortable moving around the city.
* Eye Color: Dark brown - a deep, intense color that seems to bore into those he meets.
* Hair: Short and dark, often messy and unkempt.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Chang Masato is clearly drawn to the darker corners of Tokyo. He seems to have a fascination with secrets, lies, and deception - the more complex and puzzling cases, the better. He also appears to be highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and navigate the city's hidden underbelly with ease.

On a personal level, Chang Masato is driven by a desire to uncover the truth about his sister Kiyomi's disappearance five years ago. This obsession seems to fuel his work as a private investigator and drives him to seek out answers at all costs.

It is clear that Chang Masato has a strong sense of justice and will stop at nothing to expose those who hide behind secrets and lies. He appears to be fiercely independent, preferring the company of shadows and alleys over the more polished surfaces of Tokyo's corporate world.
