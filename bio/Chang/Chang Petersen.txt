**Interests:** Chang Petersen has a passion for woodworking, which he discovered while living on the remote Norwegian island where he was shipwrecked. He creates intricate pieces from the island's rich timber, finding beauty in the functionality of his designs. However, after discovering an old book about nature and the sea, his interests shifted towards creating sculptures from driftwood and shells that tell stories of the ocean's power and beauty.

He has a deep respect for nature and its creatures, which drives his art and inspires him to create pieces that reflect this connection.
