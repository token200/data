Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Chang Olsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chang is a seasoned and resourceful individual with a strong sense of determination. As a former Swedish intelligence agent turned private investigator, he has seen his fair share of action and has likely developed a tough exterior to cope with the harsh realities of his profession. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a complex personality with a deep sense of empathy and understanding for those in need. His years of experience have taught him to navigate the darkest corners of human nature, and he is not afraid to take calculated risks to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - Chang appears to be a tall and imposing figure, which could be due to his age or athletic build.
* Eye Color: Blue - The story mentions that Sofia's eyes are "pale as the snow-covered trees back home," but it is not explicitly stated what color her eyes are. Assuming a similar pale complexion for Chang, we can infer that he likely has blue eyes, which are a common trait among Swedes.

**Interests:** As a former intelligence agent and private investigator, Chang's primary interest is in solving complex cases and uncovering hidden truths. He has a natural aptitude for understanding the intricacies of human behavior and technology, making him an expert in surveillance and hacking. However, as he delves deeper into Sofia's digital world, Chang becomes increasingly fascinated by the intersection of technology and human psychology. His interest in this area is likely driven by his own experiences with Sofia and her enigmatic online activity.

Outside of work, Chang's interests are not explicitly stated in the story. Nevertheless, given his background as an intelligence agent, it can be inferred that he enjoys activities that allow him to stay mentally sharp, such as reading books on strategy and psychology, or engaging in sports that require tactical thinking, like fencing or boxing.
