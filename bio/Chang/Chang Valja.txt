Here is a summary of Chang Valja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chang Valja is a complex and introverted individual who has been isolated from the world for most of her life. She is fiercely independent and has learned to rely only on herself, which has contributed to her wariness of outsiders. However, once she forms connections with people, she becomes intensely loyal and protective of those she cares about. Her experiences have also made her cautious and guarded, but not cynical or bitter.

**Physical Attributes:** Chang Valja is a statuesque woman with an athletic yet slender build, suggesting a high level of physical fitness from years of practicing magic. She stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, which is slightly above average for a female in the realm of Aethoria. Her hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often worn long and tied back when she practices magic or travels. Her eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost black, but with flecks of silver that seem to sparkle with inner light.

**Interests:** Chang Valja's primary interests revolve around mastering the elements and understanding the intricacies of elemental magic. She has spent countless hours studying, practicing, and experimenting with different techniques to refine her skills. Beyond magical pursuits, she is deeply curious about ancient lore, history, and the mysteries of Aethoria's forgotten past. Her love for discovery drives her to explore new lands, seek out lost knowledge, and unravel the secrets that have been hidden for centuries.

As she has grown closer to Eira and Arin, Chang Valja has also developed a passion for understanding human nature, particularly the complexities of friendship and relationships. She finds joy in sharing her knowledge with others, teaching them the responsible use of their own magical abilities, and learning from those around her.
