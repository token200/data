Based on the short story, here is a summary of Charlotte Berzins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Charlotte Berzins is known for her striking features and sharp wit. She has a keen eye for detail and is highly discerning when it comes to art. Her column in the local newspaper, "The Art Advocate," suggests that she is a confident and authoritative voice in the art world. However, the story also hints at a more empathetic side, as Charlotte feels a connection with Luna Nightingale and is inspired by their shared passion for social justice.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8"
* Eye Color: Blue (the same blue as the ones mentioned in the short story when describing Charlotte's reaction to seeing the painting)
 
 I have added height but couldn't determine eye color from the original text, so you can consider that a missing detail.
