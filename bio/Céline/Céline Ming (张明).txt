Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the fictional character Céline Ming:

**Personality:** Céline is driven, ambitious, and sharp-witted, traits that have contributed to her success in the financial world. However, beneath her polished exterior lies a complex individual with emotional scars from her parents' divorce. She struggles to connect with others on a deeper level, indicating that she may be introverted or emotionally guarded.

**Physical Attributes:** Céline is likely of Asian descent, given her Chinese name "张明" (Céline Ming). Assuming she is of Chinese origin, let's assume she has darker hair and eyes. Her height might be around 5'7" to 5'9", which would make her stand out in a crowd but still blend in with the fast-paced urban environment.

**Height:** 5'8"

**Eye Color:** Dark brown or black

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Céline has taken up art as a hobby during college. She finds solace and peace in creating art when she's not immersed in her demanding career. Her interests also include exploring new cultures and environments, such as discovering hidden galleries like "Emerging Artists" in Manhattan.

It's worth noting that these details are speculative, as they were not explicitly mentioned in the original story. However, based on the context provided, I've attempted to flesh out Céline's character and create a more well-rounded personality.
