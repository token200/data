Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Céline Liebad:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of green
- Hair Color: Rich, dark blonde with subtle waves
- Skin Tone: Smooth, creamy complexion with a warm undertone

**Personality:**
Céline is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, she appears to be a quiet, introspective person who has been content with her life of reading and history. However, beneath this façade lies a deep-seated passion for performance and a yearning for magic. Céline's past experiences as a performer have left her with a lingering fear of stage fright, but it also instilled in her a sense of creativity and self-expression that she has struggled to rekindle.

As the story progresses, we see Céline's inner strength and resilience emerge. She is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world around her, often finding herself lost in daydreams and imaginative scenarios. Her passion for history is genuine, but it also serves as a reminder of her longing for more - a desire to break free from the monotony of her life and experience something truly magical.

**Interests:**
- History (in particular, forgotten or overlooked eras)
- Reading (old books, particularly those on mythology, folklore, and forgotten sciences)
- Performance art (she was once a performer herself, but now sees it as a distant memory rather than an active pursuit)

Céline's love of reading and history serves as a coping mechanism for her feelings of restlessness. She finds comfort in the pages of old books, where she can escape into another world and temporarily forget about her own desires. However, despite her passion for these interests, Céline feels unfulfilled - as if there is more to life than just dusty manuscripts and flickering candles. Her encounter with the mysterious performer marks a turning point in her journey, as she begins to rediscover her passion for performance and the magic that lies beyond the boundaries of her ordinary world.
