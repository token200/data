Here is a summary of Sun Charron's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sun Charron is a introspective and enigmatic individual who has grown weary of the expectations placed upon her as the 'Sunblaze'. She is detached and has withdrawn from the world, preferring to walk alone in the desert with only her thoughts for company. Despite this, she still possesses a spark of warmth and concern for others, particularly those who are struggling. As she gets to know the young stranger, we see glimpses of her dry sense of humor and subtle amusement.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Golden amber
* Hair: Silver, with a wild tangle that reaches down her back like silk.
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of walking in the desert.
* Skin: Tanned and weathered from spending countless hours under the sun.

**Interests:** Sun Charron's interests are largely centered around harnessing and manipulating solar power. She has a deep connection to the sun and its energy, which drives her abilities as the 'Sunblaze'. As an elder, she is no longer actively seeking to use her powers for the benefit of others, but she still feels a sense of responsibility to those who are struggling. Her interest in helping the young stranger's village and reviving the light of their sun suggests that there may be more to her than meets the eye.

It's worth noting that Sun Charron's personality and interests have evolved over time, from being a celebrated hero to becoming a reclusive figure who is slowly drawn back into the world.
