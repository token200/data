Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Sun Pold:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (172 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes
- Skin Tone: Warm golden brown with a subtle glow, as if kissed by sunlight
- Hair Color: Rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back

**Personality:**
Sun Pold is a gentle soul with a deep love for nature and the healing arts. She possesses a nurturing spirit, which drives her to care for others and help those in need. Despite being kind-hearted, Sun Pold has a stubborn streak and can be fiercely determined when standing up for what she believes in. Her warm smile can disarm even the most skeptical of individuals, making her a beloved figure in Brindlemark.

**Interests:**
- Herbalism and botany
- Healing properties of plants and natural remedies
- Reading and storytelling (Eryndor's tales of adventure have sparked Sun Pold's love for listening to stories)
- Music and singing (though she rarely shares her own musical talents with others)

Sun Pold's connection to Eryndor Thorne has opened up new passions and interests within her. Her determination to understand his dark past will drive her forward, even if it means confronting the shadows of Brindlemark herself.
