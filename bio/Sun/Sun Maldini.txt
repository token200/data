Based on the provided story, I've created a character profile for Sun Maldini:

**Name:** Alessia Maria "Sun" Maldini
**Age:** 25
**Occupation:** Professional Footballer (Midfielder)
**Nationality:** Italian

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Weight: 130 lbs (59 kg)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks, a unique trait inherited from her Mediterranean heritage.
* Hair Color: Dark Brown with subtle hints of auburn, often styled in a short, edgy bob that frames her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:**

Sun is an energetic and fiercely competitive individual, driven by her passion for football. She's a natural-born leader on the pitch, known for her unwavering confidence and unrelenting determination. Off the field, she's humble and grounded, often crediting her teammates and coaches for her success.

Sun has a dry sense of humor, which sometimes catches those around her off guard. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray animals and volunteers at local animal shelters in her free time.
