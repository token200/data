He becomes increasingly drawn to Sophia's words and the idea of belonging to something bigger than himself.

In private moments, Bálint is fascinated by history, mythology, and the supernatural. He devours books on folklore, mythology, and the occult, seeking answers about his family's past and the mysterious forces that may be guiding him towards a new destiny.

As he embarks on this journey of self-discovery, Bálint must confront his troubled past and the demons that have haunted him for so long. Will he find redemption as The Shadow or become something more: a wolf among wolves?
