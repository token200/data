**Personality:** Bálint appears to be a driven and determined individual, willing to take risks and push boundaries to uncover the truth. He seems to have a strong sense of justice, as evident from his enthusiasm for exposing corruption and deceit. However, he also exhibits caution and prudence, as seen in his decision to heed his source's warning to be careful.

However, considering his profession as a journalist and his late-night investigative work, I would imagine him to be a somewhat worn but alert individual.
