Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Bálint Ozola:

**Personality:** Bálint Ozola is a skilled and determined huntress who approaches the unknown with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. She is driven by facts and evidence, yet remains open to the possibility of the supernatural. Her confidence and self-assurance are evident in her ability to navigate the vast forest with ease, while also showing respect for the mysterious forces she encounters.

**Physical Attributes:** Bálint Ozola stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of tracking and hunting. Her dark hair is long and tied back in a ponytail, framing her heart-shaped face and angular features. Her piercing emerald green eyes seem to gleam with an inner light, hinting at a sharp intellect and quick wit. Her worn leather boots and practical clothing suggest a connection to the land and a no-nonsense approach to life.
