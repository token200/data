Here is a summary of Bálint Nowak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bálint is an inquisitive and driven individual with a passion for history. He is curious about the human experience and seeks to understand people beyond dusty texts and photographs. He is likely introverted, preferring to observe and listen rather than being the center of attention. As he develops his relationship with Dr. Szabó, we see Bálint's confidence grow as he finds his voice and shares his ideas.

**Physical Attributes:** Bálint has an unassuming appearance that allows him to blend into the background. He is likely around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with a slender build and a reserved demeanor. His eye color is a deep brown that seems to hold a hint of intensity when he's focused on his work.

**Interests:** Bálint's primary interest is in history, specifically the lives of 19th-century Hungarian nobles. He has spent years researching their stories, but he feels like there's something missing – a connection with the people he's studying that goes beyond mere knowledge. As the story progresses, we see Bálint developing an interest in understanding human relationships and dynamics, particularly through his conversations with Dr. Szabó.

Additional details:

* Bálint has short, dark brown hair that is often neatly trimmed.
* He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.
* Despite being introverted, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when he feels comfortable enough to let his guard down.

These physical attributes and interests are intended to provide a more detailed picture of Bálint's character, while also leaving room for interpretation and development as the story progresses.
