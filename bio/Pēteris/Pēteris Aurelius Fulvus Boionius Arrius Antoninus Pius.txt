Pēteris appears to be introspective, contemplative, and perhaps even melancholic. He is burdened by the weight of his family's legacy and feels overshadowed by his illustrious forebears. However, after encountering the wise old orator, he begins to shift his perspective, embracing a more proactive approach to forging his own path in history.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Eye Color: Deep Blue - A distinctive feature that reflects the character's introspective nature and potential for wisdom.
- Hair: Dark Brown, often worn in a formal style befitting a senator
- Skin Tone: Olive-toned, characteristic of his Mediterranean heritage

**Interests:**
Pēteris is clearly interested in philosophy, politics, and history. As a member of the imperial family, he has been groomed for leadership roles from an early age. The encounter with the wise old orator sparks a newfound interest in self-discovery, personal growth, and creating his own legacy.

Beyond these interests, Pēteris is likely drawn to the arts and architecture, given Rome's rich cultural heritage and his association with Marcus Aurelius, who was known for his patronage of intellectuals and artists. He may also have an appreciation for literature and poetry, as he spends time reflecting on his life and contemplating the meaning of his name.
