Here is a summary of William Kalmurzaev's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, giving off an air of intensity and focus.

**Personality:**

* William Kalmurzaev is known for his unorthodox approach to detective work, which often puts him on the edge of sanity. This suggests that he's a bit of a maverick and can think outside the box.

* His troubled past has likely left emotional scars, but he's learned to channel these feelings into his work as a detective.

**Interests:**

* Kalmurzaev is an avid collector of rare and unique artifacts - which explains why he was so drawn to Viktor Petrov's Faberg√© egg.
