Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of William Tamm's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** William Tamm is a brilliant and reclusive scientist. He is driven by his passion for discovery and is willing to take risks to achieve his goals. Despite his exceptional intelligence, he appears to be somewhat introverted and perhaps even eccentric, as evidenced by the fact that he spends most of his life studying time travel in isolation.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical descriptions provided in the original story, so I will create some based on my interpretation:

* Height: William Tamm is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) to 6'2" (188 cm), with a slender yet athletic build that would be well-suited for someone who spends a lot of time working at a bench or standing in front of complex machinery.
* Eye Color: His eyes are likely a piercing blue, which is often associated with intelligence and intensity. The color could also represent his analytical nature and focus on detail.

**Interests:** As stated in the story, William Tamm's primary interest is time travel. He has spent his entire life studying the mysteries of chronology, and his latest experiment, Chrono-Leap, represents a major breakthrough in this field. His work on time travel encompasses various aspects of physics, engineering, and mathematics, indicating that he is an interdisciplinary thinker with a deep passion for understanding the fundamental laws of the universe.

In addition to his focus on time travel, William Tamm's interest in science is likely broad and all-encompassing. He appears to be driven by a desire to make a difference in the world and leave a lasting legacy. His experience in parallel universes has also given him a unique perspective on the potential applications of his work, suggesting that he is always thinking about the broader implications of his discoveries.

It's worth noting that William Tamm's reclusive nature suggests that he may have limited social connections outside of his scientific community. However, when interacting with others, he appears to be charismatic and confident, as evidenced by his enthusiasm for sharing his work and ideas with a team of scientists in the parallel universe.
