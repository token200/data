Based on the short story, here is a summary of William Smith's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

William is a rugged individual with a wealth of emotions beneath his exterior. He has a tough shell that has protected him from the harsh realities of his profession as a photographer, but his experiences have also made him sensitive and compassionate. Despite having seen the worst of humanity, he is drawn to hope and resilience, which are reflected in his work and his relationship with Sophia.

William is a private person who has struggled to open up to others, but Sophia's kindness and empathy have helped him to see himself in a new light. He is now more willing to share his thoughts and feelings, and to explore his own dreams and desires.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and messy

The story doesn't provide much information about William's physical appearance beyond his rugged exterior, but we can infer that he is a tall and imposing figure. His blue eyes are not mentioned in the original text, so I have assigned them to him as it fits with the contrast between his tough exterior and Sophia's piercing green eyes.

**Interests:**

* Photography: William is an experienced photographer who has spent years capturing the beauty and brutality of human existence through his lens.
* Travel: He has a strong desire to travel and explore different parts of the world, which has led him to work on assignments in various locations, including Eastern Europe.
* Connection with others: Despite his tough exterior, William is drawn to forming connections with others, particularly Sophia. He finds himself opening up to her in ways he never had before.
* Personal growth: As William navigates his relationship with Sophia, he begins to explore his own dreams and desires, which indicates a growing interest in personal growth and self-awareness.

Overall, William's interests reflect his profession as a photographer, his love of travel, and his desire for connection with others. His newfound interest in personal growth suggests that he is on a journey of self-discovery, one that Sophia has helped him to embark on.
