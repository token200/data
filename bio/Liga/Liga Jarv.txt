Here is a summary of Liga Jarv's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liga Jarv is an adventurous and determined individual with an insatiable sense of wanderlust. She is fiercely independent and trusts her instincts, often relying on her intuition to guide her through the treacherous terrain of the desert. Her years as a Dune Runner under Thorne's tutelage have taught her discipline and patience, but she also has a quick wit and sharp mind that allows her to think on her feet.

**Physical Attributes:** Liga Jarv stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build. Her eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, a trait passed down from her nomadic tribe's heritage. Her dark hair is often tied back in a practical braid, revealing a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Interests:** Liga Jarv is passionate about Dune Running and exploring the ancient artifacts hidden within the desert sands. She is deeply connected to her nomadic tribe's legends and traditions, which drive her to uncover and preserve the treasures that lie beneath the surface. Her interest in history, archaeology, and cryptography also plays a significant role in her pursuits as a Dune Runner. In addition, Liga has a deep respect for the natural world and the delicate balance of the desert ecosystem, which motivates her to tread carefully and avoid disrupting the ancient sites she encounters.
