Here's a summary of Liga Rothbauer's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liga is a skilled and deadly assassin with a troubled past. She has undergone a transformation from her younger self, Lena Rothbauer, who grew up on the streets of New Haven. Liga is confident, calculated, and devoid of emotional attachment. Her past experiences have hardened her, making her resistant to emotions and empathetic connections. However, there are hints of curiosity and introspection in her demeanor, suggesting a deeper complexity beneath her tough exterior.

**Physical Attributes:** Liga Rothbauer stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of martial arts training and physical activity. Her hair is a dark, rich brown color that falls just above her shoulders, often pulled back to reveal her sharp jawline and piercing eyes. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to bore into those she meets. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, a symbol of her past life as Lena.

**Interests:** Liga's interests are largely centered around her work as an assassin and mercenary. She has no discernible hobbies or passions outside of her profession. However, there is a sense of curiosity about the world beyond her line of work, which she sometimes indulges in through covert reconnaissance missions or surveillance on her targets. Her job requires her to be constantly vigilant and aware of her surroundings, making her an expert in stealth and strategy.

It's worth noting that Liga's backstory is still somewhat mysterious, leaving room for further exploration and development of her character.
