Here is a summary of Liga Dubois' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liga Dubois is known for her fiery spirit and sharp wit, earning her the nickname "The Enforcer" among her peers. However, despite her tough exterior, she has a softening heart, particularly when it comes to Takashi, the owner of the local ramen shop. She is kind, gentle, and open-hearted, with a deep sense of compassion and empathy. Liga's quick wit and cleverness serve her well in both her street fighting career and personal relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Liga stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with athletic yet toned physique honed from years of training in Kenjutsu. Her eye color is a piercing brown that seems to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or challenges. Her hair is short and spiky, often styled in a messy, street-fighter's look that adds to her intimidating presence on the streets.

**Interests:** Liga Dubois has a passion for Kenjutsu, the ancient art of Japanese sword fighting, which she practices extensively in her free time. She also enjoys spicy food and philosophical debates, which brings her together with Takashi at the ramen shop. In addition to her martial arts pursuits, Liga is an avid observer of human nature and behavior, often seeking out new experiences and connections that allow her to grow as a person.

It's worth noting that Liga's interests may evolve over time, particularly if she were to continue to develop her relationship with Takashi.
