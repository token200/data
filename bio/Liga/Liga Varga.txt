Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Liga Varga's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Liga Varga is a complex and multifaceted individual with a tough exterior. She possesses razor-sharp wit and quick tongue, which she uses to manipulate those around her. However, beneath her formidable presence lies a vulnerable and human side. She has a deep emotional scar from her past, which makes her guarded and secretive about her personal life.

**Physical Attributes:** Liga Varga is described as being "tall" (no specific height mentioned), with an imposing presence. Her eye color is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on the character's personality and background, it can be inferred that she has piercing blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** The story hints at Liga Varga's passion for organized crime and her work as an enforcer in the underground fighting ring. She appears to derive a sense of thrill and satisfaction from these activities, which is evident in her ruthless behavior towards opponents. However, there are no specific interests mentioned in terms of hobbies or leisure activities.

It's worth noting that Liga Varga seems to be deeply invested in maintaining her reputation as a formidable enforcer, so it's possible that she has limited personal interests outside of her work. Additionally, her relationship with Viktor and her growing vulnerability suggest that she may be developing new emotions and connections beyond her tough exterior.
