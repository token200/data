**Physical Attributes:** Liga stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with long, curly brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, but with a hint of green around the edges, giving them an otherworldly sparkle. She has a small tattoo of a sprig of leaves on her left shoulder blade and a silver necklace bearing a tiny crystal pendant that holds sentimental value.

**Personality:** Liga is a passionate and determined individual with a strong sense of conviction and purpose. Her unyielding commitment to environmental causes has earned her respect and admiration from those who know her. She is fiercely intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable, able to navigate complex problems with ease. Liga's quiet confidence and empathy make her an effective communicator, able to bring people together around shared goals.

**Interests:** Liga is deeply rooted in the natural world, with a lifelong fascination for botany, ecology, and conservation. She has spent countless hours studying the habits of various plant and animal species, learning about their habitats, behaviors, and interconnectedness. Her research interests lie at the intersection of sustainable practices, climate change mitigation, and social justice.

In addition to her professional pursuits, Liga is an avid hiker, kayaker, and rock climber, finding solace in the physical act of exploring and appreciating the beauty of nature. She enjoys practicing yoga, listening to folk music, and reading books on philosophy, science fiction, and poetry. When not working or engaging in outdoor activities, Liga can often be found scribbling notes in her journal, sketching plant species, or playing with her adopted rescue cat, Kaja.

Liga's mantra – "Liga Maria Stensson" – has become a guiding force in her life, reminding her of the importance of preserving the natural world and the delicate balance between human existence and environmental sustainability.
