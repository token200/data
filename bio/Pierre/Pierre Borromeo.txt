Here is a summary of Pierre Borromeo's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Pierre stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, often described as having a rich, velvety texture. His dark brown hair is always neatly styled, framing his heart-shaped face. He has a strong jawline and a scattering of light stubble that adds to his rugged charm.

**Personality:** Pierre is a free-spirited individual with an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. He is drawn to the unknown and the unexplained, often finding himself at the edge of conventions and societal expectations. Despite his privileged upbringing, he has always felt suffocated by the weight of his family's wealth and status, yearning for something more meaningful in life.

**Interests:** Pierre is fascinated by history, particularly the secrets and stories hidden within Venice's ancient walls. He is an avid collector of rare artifacts and trinkets, often acquiring them during his adventures with Giovanni. He has a keen eye for detail and is always on the lookout for new discoveries to add to his collection. When not exploring the city or collecting curiosities, Pierre enjoys reading about philosophy, literature, and art, seeking inspiration in the works of great minds.

In addition to these interests, Pierre has developed a passion for navigation and exploration, often taking to the Grand Canal in search of hidden gems and new perspectives on the city. His love for gondolas and waterborne travel is evident in his relaxed demeanor when standing near the canal, as seen at the beginning of our story.

Pierre's journey with Giovanni has also sparked a sense of creativity within him, often leaving him pondering abstract ideas and reflecting on life beyond the confines of his own family's expectations.
