As an artist, he is deeply intuitive and empathetic, able to tap into the emotional resonance of his subjects and convey them through his art. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or reserved to those who don't know him, but once you get to know Pierre, you'll discover a kindred spirit with a passion for the unknown and the unexplained.
