Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Pierre Leblanc:

**Personality:** Pierre Leblanc is a determined and resourceful individual. As a private investigator, he has developed a strong sense of resilience and adaptability, allowing him to navigate the complex web of Paris' underworld with ease. He appears to be driven by a strong moral compass, as evidenced by his willingness to take on cases that may not yield immediate results. Pierre's dry wit and ability to observe others suggest that he is a skilled listener and empathizer.

**Physical Attributes:** Pierre Leblanc stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with an athletic build that suggests regular exercise. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, while his eyes are a deep, piercing blue (not green, as seen in the story). He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely obtained during one of his many adventures.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Pierre's interests lie primarily in solving mysteries and uncovering truth. He is drawn to cases that challenge him intellectually and push him outside his comfort zone. In his free time, he enjoys reading classic literature ( particularly French authors like Dumas and Flaubert) and exploring the city's hidden corners and lesser-known neighborhoods.

In addition to these interests, Pierre has a deep appreciation for the art of observation and the psychology of human behavior. He is likely an avid listener and observer of people, able to pick up on subtle cues and tell stories from what others reveal about themselves.

It's worth noting that Colette Dumont was not described in terms of physical appearance; however, her striking features are implied through Pierre's descriptions of their encounter.
