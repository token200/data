Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Harry Pētersone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Harry is described as "young" but also ambitious, driven, and determined. He's someone who can focus for long periods, taking only brief breaks to recharge. His enthusiasm and energy are evident when he discovers the potential scandal, and he's willing to put in extra effort to get to the truth. This suggests that Harry has a strong work ethic and is passionate about his job as a journalist.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there's no detailed information about Harry's physical appearance, but we can infer some traits based on the story. He appears to be of Latvian heritage, given the mention of his surname (Pētersone). Assuming that he's not overly tall or physically imposing (given the description of him huddled in his office), Harry might have a relatively average height, possibly around 5'8" (173 cm) or slightly shorter. His eye color is not specified, but considering the Baltic region where Riga is located, it's possible that he has blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Harry's primary interest is in uncovering and reporting on stories of corruption and deceit. He's clearly driven by a desire to tell important and impactful stories, as evident from his dedication to the investigation. His enthusiasm for traditional Latvian food (specifically pierogi) also suggests that he might enjoy trying new cuisines and experiencing different cultures.

It's worth noting that these details are speculative based on a single short story, but they provide a starting point for further character development.
