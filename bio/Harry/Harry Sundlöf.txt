Here's a summary of the fictional character Harry Sundlöf:

**Personality:** Harry appears to be introverted and introspective, as he is overwhelmed with nostalgia and emotions when returning to his hometown of Åttna. He seems numb and detached at first, struggling to process the news of his mother's passing. However, as he spends more time with Helga Svensson, a kind and compassionate woman who knew his mother, he begins to feel a sense of peace wash over him.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are described in the short story. However, for the sake of completeness, let's fill in some missing details:

* **Height:** Harry is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build.
* **Eye Color:** His eyes are a deep shade of blue, which seems fitting for a character who has a connection to nature and the outdoors.

**Interests:** Given that Åttna is surrounded by woods, it's likely that Harry grew up enjoying outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or exploring the forest. He may have a passion for nature, conservation, or environmentalism, which could be an underlying interest or motivation for his return to Åttna.

Additional details:

* **Age:** Based on the context of the story, it's possible that Harry is in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s.
* **Background:** As a child, Harry likely grew up with a loving family and close relationships with friends. His return to Åttna suggests that he may have been away from home for education, work, or other life pursuits.

Keep in mind that these details are speculative, as they are not explicitly mentioned in the original short story.
