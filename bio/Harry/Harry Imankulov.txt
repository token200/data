His years as a Spetsnaz operative have honed his skills to be efficient and detached, leaving him with a tendency to keep people at arm's length. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, which often makes it difficult for others to get close to him. Despite this, he has a deep-seated sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn short and neatly trimmed
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of military training
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at

**Interests:**

Harry's interests are centered around his work as a Spetsnaz operative and his subsequent life off the grid. He is skilled in multiple martial arts disciplines, including judo, sambo, and hand-to-hand combat. He is also an expert marksmanship, strategist, and tactician.

When not working on cases, Harry enjoys solitude and quiet contemplation, often spending hours sitting in dimly lit cafes or staring out at the Moscow skyline. He has a fondness for whiskey and cigars, which he rarely shares with anyone but himself.

In terms of personal hobbies, Harry is fascinated by technology and surveillance systems, having spent years studying and using advanced espionage tools during his Spetsnaz days. His experience as a mole within the Russian government also gave him a unique understanding of the inner workings of corrupt organizations, making him an expert in infiltration and deception.
