**Personality:**
Harry Liebad is a quiet and introspective individual who observes life from a distance. However, after meeting his mentor, he has begun to unravel the mysteries within himself and develop a passion for photography, which has led to self-discovery. He appears to be calm and contemplative, with an unassuming presence that allows him to blend into the background.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: Harry is slightly above average height, but his exact stature is not specified.
- Eye Color: His eye color is not mentioned in the story, so I will assume it to be a neutral or earthy tone, consistent with his quiet and introspective nature.

**Interests:**
Harry's main interest is photography, which has become an integral part of his life after meeting his mentor. He is particularly drawn to capturing the world around him through his lens, seeking to understand the stories behind every image. This passion for photography has led him on a journey of self-discovery and exploration.
