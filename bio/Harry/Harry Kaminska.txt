Here is a summary of the fictional character Harry Kaminska:

**Physical Attributes:** Harry Kaminska stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall with piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His jet-black hair is often styled perfectly, adding to his dashing and suave appearance.

**Personality:** Beneath his charming exterior, Harry has a complex web of emotions and motivations. He is driven by a sense of self-preservation and the need to constantly stay one step ahead of his pursuers. However, this fa√ßade also hides a deep-seated guilt and uncertainty about the morality of his actions as a high-stakes thief.

**Interests:** Harry's interests lie in the world of high-stakes thievery, where he can use his wit and cunning to outsmart his targets. He is drawn to artifacts with historical significance, such as the priceless ancient scroll he stole from the museum. Despite his rough exterior, Harry has a fascination with history and the stories behind the artifacts he steals.

It's worth noting that despite being a thief, Harry seems to have a strong sense of justice and may be on a path towards redemption, having met Dr. Rachel Lee who shares an understanding for him.
