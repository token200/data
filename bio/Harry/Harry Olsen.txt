Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Harry Olsen:

**Physical Attributes:** Harry is an unassuming individual with a rugged yet weathered appearance. He stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build that speaks to his nomadic upbringing. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing a face with sharp features - high cheekbones, a straight nose, and piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom.

**Personality:** Harry is an introspective and reserved person, preferring to listen and observe rather than speak first. This allows him to absorb information like a sponge and process it at his own pace. Despite his reserved nature, Harry has an innate sense of curiosity and wonder, driving him to seek out new knowledge and experiences. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else, which sometimes leads him to be aloof or standoffish with others.

**Interests:** Harry's interests revolve around astronomy, ancient history, and the mysteries of the universe. He has a deep fascination with the night sky and spends countless hours gazing at the stars, searching for patterns and connections that others may have missed. His love for the open road is also deeply ingrained, and he finds solace in the freedom to roam and explore new places. Harry's travels often take him to dusty towns and forgotten streets, where he can uncover hidden secrets and piece together the puzzle of his own mysterious past.

In addition to these interests, Harry has a strong appreciation for literature, folklore, and mythology. He is particularly drawn to stories about ancient civilizations and their achievements in astronomy, which resonate with his own experiences as a nomad. Through his conversations with Rachel, he discovered an affinity for mysticism and the esoteric, which further fuels his curiosity and drives him to explore the unknown.
