Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Harry Cooper:

**Personality:** Harry Cooper is a free-spirited individual who longs for excitement and creativity. He has a tendency to feel trapped in his mundane life in Willow Creek, which he overcomes by transforming into "The Ghost," a mysterious prankster who lets loose at night. As The Ghost, he exhibits a carefree and mischievous personality, but also shows a vulnerable side as he struggles with self-doubt and insecurity.

**Physical Attributes:** Harry Cooper is likely in his late teens or early twenties, given the context of the story. He is unknown for his physical attributes, except that one detail is mentioned: "Without any practice or rehearsal, [he] simply... jammed." This suggests that he may not be particularly skilled at playing the harmonica or performing other talents. However, we can make an educated guess about his appearance based on the story. Let's say Harry Cooper stands around 5'8" to 5'10" (173 cm - 178 cm) with a lean build and average weight. His eye color is likely brown, given the common association between the American Midwest setting of Willow Creek and this eye color.

**Interests:** Harry Cooper's interests seem to revolve around creativity, self-expression, and playfulness. As The Ghost, he enjoys playing pranks and causing mischief in Willow Creek, which suggests a love of humor and absurdity. In his personal life, Harry may be interested in music (specifically harmonica), cooking, or other activities that allow him to express himself creatively. His experience at the talent show also highlights his passion for performance and making people laugh.
