Based on the provided 400-word story, I've created a summary for Ebba Jhih-hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)

Ebba Jhih-hao is a charismatic and enigmatic figure, exuding confidence and an air of quiet authority. She is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused on her craft, with a deep understanding of the mystical energies that permeate Zhin'tau's ancient cityscape. Ebba is resourceful, adaptable, and willing to take calculated risks, which serves her well in navigating the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shape the city's magical underworld.

**Interests:**
As an apothecary and mystic, Ebba Jhih-hao has a deep passion for studying the rarest herbs, potions, and magical artifacts. She is particularly drawn to sources of ancient knowledge, forgotten spells, and the secrets hidden within Zhin'tau's mystical energies. Her interests also extend to understanding the workings of the city's portal network, with its many glowing gateways connecting various realms and dimensions.
