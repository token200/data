**Physical Attributes:**
Ebba stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build, typical of her active lifestyle. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back, while her eyes are an striking shade of bright blue that seem to sparkle with curiosity.

Ebba is a firecracker - a dynamic and fearless individual who isn't afraid to speak truth to power or challenge the status quo. Her sharp wit and quick thinking have earned her many admirers in the journalism world, but also made her some formidable foes among those who try to silence her. Despite her tough exterior, Ebba has a compassionate heart and a deep empathy for others, which drives her to uncover stories that need to be told.

**Interests:**
Ebba's passion for investigative reporting is only matched by her love of outdoor activities like hiking and kayaking. She's an avid reader of philosophy and history books, and enjoys attending concerts and festivals when she can. Ebba is also a bit of a foodie, and loves trying out new recipes from around the world - especially traditional Latvian dishes like rupjmaize (rye bread) and zupa (sour soup).
