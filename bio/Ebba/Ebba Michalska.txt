Here's a summary of the fictional character Ebba Michalska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ebba is a master thief and con artist with a reputation for being untouchable. She has a complex and troubled past, marked by tragedy and heartbreak, which has driven her to perfect her craft and seek justice in her own twisted way. Despite her tough exterior, she is deeply emotional and vulnerable, as evident from the twinge of excitement and nervousness she feels before embarking on a heist. Ebba is intelligent, resourceful, and calculating, able to think on her feet and stay one step ahead of her adversaries.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: piercing green, which seems almost otherworldly in the dim light of the museum galleries.
* Hair Color: dark brown, often styled in a sleek bob or pulled back into a ponytail for ease and discretion.
* Skin Tone: porcelain doll-like complexion with a subtle scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.

**Interests:** Ebba's primary interest is thievery and con artistry, which has consumed her life for years. She has an uncanny ability to blend into her surroundings, using disguises, wigs, and accents to assume different identities. Outside of her heists, Ebba appears to have few interests or hobbies, preferring the solitude and anonymity that comes with living on the edge.

However, beneath the surface, Ebba is driven by a deep-seated desire for justice and revenge against those who have wronged her in the past. The theft of her sister's locket represents a personal triumph, one that will allow her to finally lay the ghosts of her childhood to rest.
