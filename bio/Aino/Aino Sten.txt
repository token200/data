**Personality:** Aino is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, she appears to be a driven and determined private investigator who can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and emotional scar tissue from past losses, particularly the death of her younger brother Kalle.

In terms of other interests or hobbies, we don't see much mentioned in this brief summary, but it's possible that Aino is an avid reader or researcher, given her background as a private investigator.
