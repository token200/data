Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aino Bergström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aino appears to be a introspective and emotional person who has a deep connection with her past. She struggles with feelings of not belonging and being an outsider, which suggests that she may have had difficulty finding her place in the world after leaving Ravenswood. However, as she returns to the town, she is able to reconnect with the people and experiences that brought her joy, indicating that she has a capacity for growth and self-reflection.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel

Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the story aside from eye color. For this summary, I have added the height as it seems fitting based on the context of Aino's actions and her ability to walk through the deserted streets without any notable issues.

**Interests:** It is not explicitly stated what Aino's interests are, but based on the narrative, it can be inferred that she has a deep connection with:

* Her past: The story highlights her memories of laughter, tears, and late-night conversations, suggesting that she values her personal history.
* Nature: Aino takes a "deep breath" as she walks through the deserted streets, indicating an appreciation for the natural world around her.
* Family and community: As she reconnects with Mrs. Lindström and the townspeople, it is clear that Aino holds a special place in her heart for these relationships.
* Food: Her enjoyment of the pastries made by Mrs. Lindström suggests that she appreciates good food and cooking.

It's worth noting that these interests are somewhat inferred from the narrative and may not be exhaustive or definitive descriptions of Aino's personality or preferences.
