His hair is dark brown and often neatly combed, framing a chiseled face with sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline. His eyes are a deep, mysterious black, like polished onyx stones that seem to hold a world of secrets within their depths.

**Personality:**
Krzysztof Leblanc exudes an air of quiet intensity and caution, as if he is constantly weighing the risks and consequences of his actions. Despite this, there is a hint of intrigue in his eyes when he's faced with a challenge or puzzle to solve. He is a master manipulator and deceiver, able to think several steps ahead of those around him.

It's worth noting that Krzysztof Leblanc seems to be driven by a sense of duty and loyalty, as evidenced by his willingness to help Pierre retrieve the stolen painting without being asked.
