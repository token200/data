Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mara Corberó, I'll create a new character based on the details provided.

Mara Corberó is a 25-year-old fictional actress and singer. She has short, dark brown hair that falls just above her chin, often styled in a messy bob. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with creativity, making her a standout in any scene. Mara stands at about 5'6" (168 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build.

As for her personality, Mara is a free-spirited and artistic individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She's passionate about social justice and uses her platform to raise awareness for various causes she believes in. Her kindness and empathy make her a beloved figure among her fans and peers alike.

When it comes to interests, Mara is an avid music lover and enjoys singing folk songs that inspire her to speak out against inequality. She's also an accomplished dancer, often incorporating contemporary and ballet moves into her performances. When not working on a project or advocating for social change, Mara can be found exploring the outdoors, hiking in the mountains, or practicing yoga.

Please note that these attributes are fictional and created based on the information provided. If you'd like to provide more context about Mara Corberó, I'd be happy to help further!
