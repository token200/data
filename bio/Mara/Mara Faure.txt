**Personality:** Mara Faure is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who values independence and self-reliance. She has a strong sense of justice and will fiercely stand up for what she believes in. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and is always willing to lend a helping hand.

**Physical Attributes:** Mara Faure stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lithe build.

Her dark brown hair is often worn in a messy bob, and she has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist.
