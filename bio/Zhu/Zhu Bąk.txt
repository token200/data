Based on the story about Zbigniew Bąkowski, I have created a summary about Zhu Bąk with made-up attributes:

Zhu Bąk is a 28-year-old pastry chef with an exceptional talent for creating intricate desserts. He stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with striking green eyes that sparkle when he's working on a new recipe.

Physically, Zhu has short, dark hair and a lean build, honed from years of spending hours in the kitchen perfecting his craft. He often wears a warm smile on his face, which makes him instantly approachable to customers.

As for interests, Zhu is deeply passionate about preserving traditional Polish recipes while experimenting with modern twists. His love for history and culture drives his creativity in the kitchen, as he tries to recreate family heirlooms from his ancestors' homeland. Outside of baking, Zhu enjoys practicing calligraphy, playing chess, and exploring Kraków's winding streets.

Zhu's passion for baking is matched only by his dedication to learning about Polish folk traditions. He is particularly drawn to the intricate designs and patterns found in traditional costumes, which inspire him to incorporate these elements into his pastry creations.

When he's not experimenting with new recipes or working on a special project, Zhu can be found browsing vintage cookbooks at local markets or taking long walks along the Vistula River, lost in thought. His dream is to one day open his own bakery, where customers can come to experience the rich flavors and traditions of Polish cuisine.

As for his height, I've chosen 5'8" (173 cm) as a compromise between average height and Zbigniew's mentioned height of approximately 180 cm.
