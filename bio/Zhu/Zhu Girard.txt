I'd love to create a fictional character for you! Based on the prompt, here's a summary of Zhu Girard:

**Physical Attributes:**
Zhu Girard is a 25-year-old Chinese-Canadian woman with a slender yet athletic build. She stands at about 5'8" (172 cm) tall and has long, straight black hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, a deep blue color that seems to sparkle with mischief. Zhu has a small tattoo of a Chinese character for "Courage" on her left wrist, which she got during a trip to China.

**Personality:**
Zhu is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who lives life on her own terms. She's fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Despite her tough exterior, Zhu has a soft spot for those in need and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Her quick wit and sharp tongue often get her into trouble, but she's never afraid to speak her mind. Zhu is also deeply curious and loves to learn new things, which makes her a great problem-solver.

**Interests:**
Zhu has a passion for photography, music, and martial arts. She loves capturing breathtaking landscapes with her camera and often takes road trips to remote locations to escape the city. When she's not behind the lens, Zhu enjoys playing the guitar and singing in a local band. She's also an expert in traditional Chinese martial arts and practices regularly to stay fit and focused.
