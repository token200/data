I'm excited to create a new character for you. Let's start from scratch.

Meet Zhu Pawlak, a 25-year-old intergalactic smuggler with a charming smile and an adventurous spirit. Here are some key details about Zhu:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright Blue (with a hint of green when looking at high-temperature stars)
* Hair: Short, spiky black hair with silver streaks from a recent injury
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a scattering of freckles on his cheeks and nose

**Personality:**

Zhu is a free-spirited, charismatic individual who lives for the thrill of the chase. As a skilled smuggler, he's always looking for the next big score, whether it's outrunning Imperial patrols or evading rival smugglers. Despite his reckless nature, Zhu has a soft spot for those in need and will often take on jobs that benefit the greater good.

**Interests:**

* Flying: Zhu loves nothing more than taking the helm of his trusty ship, the "Marauder's Revenge." He's an expert pilot with a talent for navigating through asteroid fields.
* Music: When he's not flying or smuggling, Zhu enjoys listening to energetic space-rock music and playing his electric guitar.
* History: Despite his love for adventure, Zhu is fascinated by ancient civilizations and lost technologies. He spends his downtime studying the history of the galaxy and searching for hidden artifacts.

**Backstory:**

Zhu was born on a remote planet on the edge of the galaxy, where he grew up listening to tales of space-faring smugglers and rebels. As soon as he could fly, he joined his father's smuggling operation, quickly proving himself as a skilled pilot and negotiator. After a falling out with his family, Zhu set out on his own, taking on high-stakes jobs and making a name for himself in the underworld.

Feel free to add or modify any of these details to suit your story! I'd love to help you develop Zhu Pawlak's character further if you have any questions or would like to continue writing a story based on him.
