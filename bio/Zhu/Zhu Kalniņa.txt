Based on the provided short story, I've created a summary of the fictional character Zhu Kalniņa:

**Personality:** Zhu Kalniņa is a creative and passionate individual with an unwavering dedication to her art. Her enthusiasm and love for Latvian culture are evident in every brushstroke, and she has a natural ability to bring out the best in those around her. She is also kind-hearted and values the relationships she forms, particularly with Jānis, who becomes a mentor and close friend.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** Zhu stands at 5'6" (168 cm), a slender yet athletic build that allows her to move freely and easily between her studio and the streets of Riga.
- **Eye Color:** Her eyes are an expressive shade of green, with flecks of gold that seem to sparkle when she talks about her art or Latvian traditions.

**Interests:**

* Art: Painting, woodcarving, and sculpture are all passions for Zhu Kalniņa. She is constantly seeking new techniques and inspiration for her next project.
* Woodworking: After learning traditional Latvian woodworking techniques from Jānis, Zhu has become particularly skilled in this craft and often incorporates wooden elements into her artwork.
