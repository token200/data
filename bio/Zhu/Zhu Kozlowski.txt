**Personality:** Zhu Kozlowski is an eccentric and brilliant inventor with a passion for exploring the unknown. He's fiercely intelligent and always thinks outside the box, often leading to innovative breakthroughs in his work. His love for 19th-century Russian literature might make him appear introverted or moody at times, but it's actually a source of inspiration and fuel for his creativity.
