Here is a summary of Elena Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elena Koval is a determined and resourceful individual who has been driven by her desire for justice since her sister's tragic death at the hands of The Phoenix. She is fiercely independent and intensely focused on her mission to bring down the terrorist organization. Her past training as a Spetsnaz operative has instilled in her a strong sense of discipline and strategic thinking, allowing her to navigate complex situations with ease. Despite this, Elena's personal life may remain somewhat of an enigma, as she appears to be willing to put herself in harm's way to achieve her goals.

**Physical Attributes:** Elena Koval is likely a petite woman, possibly around 5'6" (168 cm) tall, which would be a relatively average height for someone from Moscow. Her eye color could be blue or green, with piercing eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. She may have short, dark hair that is often styled in a practical and professional manner.

**Interests:** Elena's primary interest is her mission to infiltrate The Phoenix and bring them down, but it seems that she also has a strong sense of personal justice and revenge against Specter. Outside of her work with Spetsnaz, Elena may have little time for hobbies or leisure activities due to her demanding schedule. However, as someone who is deeply committed to her mission, she likely finds satisfaction in the thrill of the chase and the intellectual challenge of unraveling The Phoenix's secrets.
