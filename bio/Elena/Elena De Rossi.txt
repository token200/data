Here is a summary of Elena De Rossi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elena is a sharp-witted and quick-tongued individual with a tough exterior that hides a heart of gold. She has built a reputation as one of the most organized and detail-oriented people in her industry, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a complex and sensitive person who is still trying to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart after a messy breakup.

**Physical Attributes:** Elena stands at approximately 5'8" with bright hazel eyes that sparkle with warmth and intelligence. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of running errands and attending events.

**Interests:** Elena's interests lie in event planning, gardening, and personal growth. While she excelled at planning high-profile events, she had always struggled to make time for the things that brought her joy - gardening being one of them. Her experience with gardening has reignited a sense of purpose and belonging within her, and she now sees it as an extension of herself. Elena is also passionate about learning, self-improvement, and connecting with others on a deep level.

Some additional details I've added to flesh out Elena's character include:

* She has a love for Italian food and cooking, inherited from her nonna.
* Elena has a dry sense of humor that can catch people off guard.
* She is fiercely loyal to her loved ones and will go to great lengths to support them.
