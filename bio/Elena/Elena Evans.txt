Here is a summary of Elena's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elena is a complex and fiercely independent individual who appears to be a warm and welcoming person on the surface. However, she struggles with feelings of burnout, loneliness, and disconnection from the world around her. She has a hard time asking for help or opening up to others, preferring to handle her problems alone. Despite this, she is deeply passionate about life and has a desire to rediscover herself.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown, often styled in loose waves
* Skin Tone: Fair with a warm glow from spending time outdoors

**Interests:** Elena is passionate about baking and running her own business, "Sweet Treats." She has a love for experimenting with new flavors and techniques. However, she has recently discovered a newfound appreciation for:

* Reading (she joins a book club)
* Yoga
* Nature (long walks in the woods)
* Spending time with loved ones (her friendship with Alex reignites her connection to others)

As Elena begins to rediscover herself outside of "Sweet Treats," it becomes clear that she has a rich inner life and a deep desire for connection, self-care, and personal growth.
