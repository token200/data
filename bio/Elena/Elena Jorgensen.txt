Despite her accomplishments as a botanist and amateur mycologist, she has a troubled past marked by the loss of her parents at a young age. This experience has left an indelible scar on her psyche, making her emotionally guarded and hesitant to open up to others. However, upon reconnecting with her daughter Sophia, Elena shows signs of hope, guilt, regret, and a desire for redemption.

**Interests:** Elena's primary interests lie in botany and mycology, with a deep passion for studying the unique flora and fungi that grow in the surrounding forests. She spends countless hours collecting specimens, examining their delicate details, and learning about their properties. Her love for nature is not limited to her work; she also finds solace in the peaceful surroundings of the forest, often returning to the woods at night to clear her mind and connect with her daughter Sophia.

In addition to her scientific pursuits, Elena values her personal relationships, particularly those with her daughter. She hopes to rebuild their bond and create a new life together, one that doesn't involve past pain but instead fosters healing, forgiveness, and growth.
