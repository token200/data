Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Elena Verdi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elena is a complex and introspective individual. She has struggled with her dual identity and cultural heritage, which has led to feelings of disconnection and limbo. As an adult, she has adopted a detached persona to cope with these emotions, but this has also made it difficult for her to form genuine connections with others. However, upon discovering the jazz music in Trastevere, Elena begins to feel a sense of longing and authenticity that drives her to confront her past and learn to love herself.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are explicitly mentioned in the story. However, based on the Italian-German heritage mentioned, it's possible to make an educated guess:

* Height: Average or slightly above average (Italian women tend to be petite, but there is also a German component that might influence her height)
* Eye Color: Brown eyes, possibly with a warm undertone, reflecting her Italian mother and German father

**Interests:** Based on the story, Elena's interests seem to include:

* Jazz music: The discovery of this genre in Trastevere has a profound impact on Elena, awakening something deep within her.
* Self-discovery and authenticity: As she navigates her cultural heritage and past experiences, Elena becomes increasingly interested in finding a sense of belonging and purpose that is true to herself.

It's worth noting that these interests are not yet fully developed in the story, but they seem to be emerging as a result of Elena's transformative experience.
