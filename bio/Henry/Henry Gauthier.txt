Here is a summary of Henry Gauthier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Henry is a creative genius with a passion for music. He is introverted and prefers to keep to himself, but has a deep-seated desire to connect with others on a profound level. Despite his humility as a librarian, he is a perfectionist and yearns for recognition as a musician.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue
* Hair: Neat brown hair that falls just above his shoulders
* Facial Features: Bespectacled face with high cheekbones and a gentle jawline

**Interests:** Music is Henry's primary passion, and he spends most of his free time playing the guitar and composing songs. He is drawn to music that evokes emotions and tells stories of love, loss, and longing. Outside of music, Henry enjoys reading (particularly classics and literature) and appreciates the peaceful atmosphere of the library.

In addition to these details, I have inferred a few other aspects about Henry's personality:

* He values solitude but craves connection with others.
* He is driven by his creative pursuits and is willing to take risks to achieve his goals.
* He has a rich inner life and values introspection and self-discovery.
