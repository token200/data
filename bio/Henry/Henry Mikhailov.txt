Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Henry Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Henry is a complex individual with a mysterious past. He is haunted by his troubled history as a former spy and assassin, known as "The Ghost." Despite this, he has left his old life behind and seeks solace in the quiet streets of rural France. He is introspective and guarded, allowing only those who get close to see beyond his fa√ßade. Henry is also fiercely independent and private, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Henry stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm), with rugged features chiseled from the granite landscape of his Russian upbringing. His piercing blue eyes, often described as "two icebergs," hold secrets and stories of their own. A faint scar above his left eyebrow serves as a reminder of a past battle fought and won, but at what cost? Henry's physical presence is imposing, yet he moves with a quiet confidence that commands respect.

**Interests:** Henry has a deep appreciation for the world beyond his small town in rural France. He takes long walks through the ancient streets, passing by the 14th-century church, and often visits local markets or quaint cafes to observe life without being noticed. Despite his preference for solitude, Henry finds himself drawn to Sophie's curiosity and sense of adventure. As they spend more time together, he begins to leave notes on the kitchen counter, offering cryptic advice and hinting at the world beyond their small town.

**Additional Details:** Henry's love of mystery and intrigue is evident in his fascination with puzzles and enigmas. He seems to enjoy piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments of information, much like how he has tried to rebuild his life from the scattered pieces of his past.
