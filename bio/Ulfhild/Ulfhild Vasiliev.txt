Here is a summary of Ulfhild Vasiliev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ulfhild is a complex and enigmatic individual with a dark past that has shaped her into a ruthless and calculated assassin. She is driven by a fierce determination to reclaim her birthright: freedom, which she feels was taken from her by the corrupting influence of her noble heritage. Despite this, she is not devoid of emotions; instead, she wears them like armor, protecting herself from vulnerability. Ulfhild's greatest strength lies in her ability to remain patient and composed under pressure, much like a ghost waiting for its next move.

**Physical Attributes:** Ulfhild stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of training and combat. Her piercing sapphire eyes seem to see right through you, instilling an air of unease in those who cross her path. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like the night sky, framing a heart-shaped face with high cheekbones and a determined jawline. A small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist seems to be a subtle symbol of her deadly craft.

**Interests:** Ulfhild is an avid student of strategy, tactics, and the dark arts – particularly those that allow her to manipulate and control others. She has a fascination with the ancient history of Prague and its mystical energies, often using this knowledge to further her own agenda. When she is not actively engaged in her work as an assassin, Ulfhild enjoys sipping fine ales and listening to the city's tavern gossip, always on the lookout for new information or potential targets.

Her interests are largely centered around her own survival, freedom, and the ability to exact revenge on those who wronged her. As she navigates the treacherous world of medieval Prague, Ulfhild remains a constant reminder that nothing is as it seems – not even death itself.
