**Personality:** Ulfhild is a fearless and determined warrior with an insatiable thirst for battle and adventure. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Princess Lin, and will stop at nothing to protect them. His unwavering spirit and unshakeable confidence inspire loyalty in his allies and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies.

**Physical Attributes:** Ulfhild stands at an impressive height of 6'2" (188 cm), with a chiseled physique honed from years of rigorous martial arts training. His piercing eyes are a striking shade of indigo, which seem to gleam with an inner intensity when he focuses on his opponents. His raven-black hair is often tied back in a ponytail, revealing the sharp lines of his jaw and prominent cheekbones.

**Interests:** Ulfhild's passions lie in martial arts, sword fighting, and strategic warfare. He spends hours honing his skills with Dragon's Breath, perfecting techniques that have been passed down through generations of warrior-masters. When not on campaign, he enjoys practicing calligraphy, studying ancient histories, and listening to the tales of wise sages.

It's worth noting that, as a fictional character inspired by the legend of Ulfhild Wei from Chinese mythology, his original name and cultural background were altered to create an Eastern-inspired narrative.
