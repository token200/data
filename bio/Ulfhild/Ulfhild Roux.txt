**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)

Her years of experience as a journalist have honed her instincts, making her highly perceptive and able to read people and situations quickly.

She's fiercely independent and self-motivated, with an unshakeable sense of justice driving her pursuit of the truth. This fire in her belly can sometimes make her come across as confrontational or unyielding to those who don't share her passion for uncovering hidden truths.

Despite this tough exterior, Ulfhild has a vulnerable side that she guards closely. Her past experiences have taught her to trust no one and keep her guard up, making it difficult for her to form close relationships. However, as the story progresses, hints of vulnerability and emotional depth will start to emerge.

**Interests:**

Ulfhild's primary interest is journalism, specifically investigative reporting. She thrives on uncovering secrets and shedding light on dark corners of society. When she's not working, you can find her:

* Hiking or backpacking in remote areas to clear her mind and find inspiration
* Reading history books and documentaries to expand her knowledge on various topics
* Attending underground journalism conferences and networking with fellow reporters

Overall, Ulfhild Roux is a driven, intelligent, and resourceful individual who is not afraid to take risks or challenge the status quo.
