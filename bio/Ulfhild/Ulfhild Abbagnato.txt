**Personality:** Ulfhild is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, she presents herself as a polished and calculating member of the esteemed Abbagnato family, known for their cunning and strategic prowess. However, beneath this facade lies a creative and artistic soul, yearning to express herself through music and performance. Despite her natural talent for combat, Ulfhild has learned to channel her emotions into more refined pursuits, such as playing the instrument, but still retains a sense of restlessness and a desire for freedom.

**Physical Attributes:** Ulfhild stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of martial training. Her piercing green eyes are her most striking feature, with a hint of gold around the iris that seems to sparkle in the right light. Her dark hair is typically pulled back into a tight bun, revealing a small tattoo of a musical note on her left cheekbone - a subtle rebellion against her family's traditional expectations.

Her natural affinity for combat has led her to develop an interest in martial arts and strategy, which she sees as essential tools for navigating the complex web of alliances and rivalries that define her world.

As Ulfhild continues to navigate the intricate landscape of her family's legacy, it remains to be seen how much of herself she will reveal to others - or whether she will ever truly find a way to reconcile her dual passions and identities.
