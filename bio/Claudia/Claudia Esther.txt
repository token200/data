She has a radiant complexion with high cheekbones and full lips that curve into a mischievous smile.

**Interests:** Claudia is an artist at heart, with a deep love for music, dance, and the performing arts. As Vivian LaRue, she's a sultry jazz singer who delights in exploring the city's underbelly through her performances. She's also drawn to people-watching and immersing herself in the lives of others, often adopting their mannerisms and speech patterns. In her downtime, Claudia enjoys getting lost in bookstores, browsing art galleries, or attending underground music events.
