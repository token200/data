Personality:
Florence has a quiet and introspective nature, often preferring solitary moments to social gatherings. However, when working on a project or researching a topic she's passionate about, she becomes fiercely dedicated and intensely focused. This attention to detail allows her to unravel complex historical narratives and uncover hidden secrets. Florence is driven by a strong sense of curiosity and determination, which fuels her pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

Interests:
As a historian specializing in Jewish culture, Florence has a natural affinity for studying the past, particularly the experiences of marginalized communities during World War II. Her work involves sifting through archives, oral histories, and primary sources to piece together the fragmented narratives of survivors. She's deeply interested in preserving the voices of those who lived through unimaginable trauma and is driven by a desire to honor their stories.

Other possible interests:

- Florence may enjoy reading literature from Eastern European Jewish heritage, such as works by S.J. Tartakower or David Ben-Gurion.
- As an historian, she's likely familiar with various languages, including Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, and possibly other Slavic languages.
- Given her connection to the Kazimierz Jewish Cemetery and the historical significance of the area, Florence might be interested in Kraków's local history, folklore, and cultural heritage.

Overall, Florence Szymańska is a dedicated and driven historian who uses her passion for knowledge to uncover the hidden stories of those whose voices have been silenced by time.
