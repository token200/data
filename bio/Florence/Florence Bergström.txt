Here is a summary of Florence Bergström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Florence "Flo" Bergström is a fiercely independent woman with a strong sense of self-confidence. She is kind-hearted but can be feisty when confronted with criticism or negativity. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for those in need, especially the elderly, like Mr. Jenkins. Her wit and sarcasm are well-known in Ravenswood, but they only serve to add to her charm.

**Physical Attributes:** Florence stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with long, curly brown hair that often escapes her bun. Her bright green eyes sparkle with warmth and kindness. She has a small tattoo of a mixing bowl on her left wrist, which she obtained during a impulsive trip to Europe.

**Interests:** Florence is passionate about baking and takes pride in creating delicious treats for the people of Ravenswood. She loves experimenting with new recipes and flavors, often incorporating locally sourced ingredients into her creations. Outside of the bakery, Flo enjoys taking long walks along the nearby river, practicing yoga, and reading classic literature. She also has a secret passion for painting and dreams of one day opening an art studio in the town.

Florence's interests are closely tied to her love of community and connection with others. As she spends more time helping Mr. Jenkins and other townspeople, she finds joy in bringing people together through food and shared experiences. Her bakery becomes a hub for social gatherings, fundraisers, and impromptu conversations that fill the gaps between everyday life.
