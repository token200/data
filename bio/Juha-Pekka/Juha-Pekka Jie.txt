Here's a summary of Juha-Pekka Jie's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Juha-Pekka Jie appears to be a diligent and introspective detective. He is deeply committed to solving cases and understanding the intricacies of human behavior. His experience with harsh winters in Helsinki seems to have made him more perceptive and observant. Despite his passion for his work, there are hints of self-doubt and uncertainty about his own cultural heritage.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the description of Jie trudging through the snow-covered streets, it can be inferred that he is:

* Of average height, likely between 5'9" to 6'1" (175 cm to 185 cm), allowing him to move comfortably in crowded spaces.
* Has a rugged yet athletic build, suitable for braving the harsh Finnish winters.
* Has piercing blue eyes, which are a common eye color among Finns. However, since Jie's partner, Liisa, describes his eyes as not being mentioned in the file, it's possible that they could be another eye color altogether.

**Interests:** Based on the story, we can infer some of Jie's interests:

* Scandinavian art: He is clearly fascinated by this subject and has a good understanding of its cultural significance.
* Finnish culture and history: As a detective specializing in cases involving collectors with a passion for Scandinavian art, it's likely that he has a deep appreciation for Finland's past.
* Mystery-solving: Jie seems to be thoroughly engrossed in solving the case, suggesting that he finds this aspect of his work incredibly stimulating.

Additionally, we can make some educated guesses about Jie's interests outside of his work:

* He may enjoy spending time outdoors, particularly during the winter months, taking advantage of Helsinki's natural beauty.
* As a Finnish native, he likely has a strong sense of community and connection to the local culture.
* Given his introspective nature, he might be an avid reader or researcher, possibly exploring topics related to Scandinavian art, history, or philosophy.
