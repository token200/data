She has wild, curly brown hair that often escapes her attempts to tame it, and wears thick-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose. Her style is casual and eclectic, reflecting her busy lifestyle as a scientist.

**Personality:** Małgorzata Lin is a brilliant and introverted individual who prefers the company of her research to that of people. Despite this, she has a deep sense of passion and dedication to her work, which drives her to push boundaries and challenge conventional thinking. Her personality is refreshingly grounded, despite her sudden rise to fame, and she remains humble and unassuming in the face of accolades.

**Interests:** Małgorzata Lin's primary interest is in understanding the mysteries of the universe, particularly in relation to black holes. She has a deep fascination with the behavior of celestial bodies and their impact on our understanding of space and time. Outside of science, she enjoys quiet walks alone, reading literature and philosophy, and sipping coffee at her favorite café.

It's worth noting that Małgorzata Lin is not depicted as having any notable interests outside of her scientific work in the original story.
