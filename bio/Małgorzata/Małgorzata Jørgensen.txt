Her hair is dark brown and often styled in loose waves. She has a slender build, which allows her to move effortlessly between the city's galleries and studios.

**Interests:** Małgorzata is deeply passionate about art, with a particular focus on capturing the vibrant spirit of Copenhagen. She spends countless hours sketching the city's iconic architecture and listening to street performers. Her love of art was initially suppressed by her parents' desire for her to pursue more "practical" pursuits, but she eventually found her true calling when she discovered Søren's gallery in Vesterbro. Today, Małgorzata dedicates herself to creating bold and expressive paintings that showcase the beauty of Copenhagen.

As a result of her artistic journey, Małgorzata has also developed an appreciation for music, which complements her love of art and the city's eclectic energy.
