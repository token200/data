Based on the character development in the provided story, I've created a summary for Małgorzata Sten:

Physical Attributes:
Małgorzata Sten stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her striking features include piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you, and raven-black hair that frames her heart-shaped face. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, adding to her mysterious allure.

Personality:
Małgorzata Sten is a sharp-witted and intelligent detective with an unyielding determination to solve cases. Her years of experience have honed her instincts, allowing her to read people and situations with ease. She is fiercely independent and has a dry sense of humor, often using sarcasm as a defense mechanism to keep people at bay. Despite this, she has a compassionate side, particularly when it comes to families affected by crime.

Interests:
In her rare moments of downtime, Małgorzata Sten enjoys reading classic literature, sipping coffee in quaint cafes, and exploring the lesser-known corners of Stockholm. She is also an avid collector of antique watches, with a particular fondness for vintage Swiss timepieces. Her love for puzzles and brain teasers keeps her mind sharp, and she often uses these skills to unravel complex mysteries.

I've replaced the surname "Sten" with Małgorzata, which means "great warrior princess" in Polish, fitting for a strong and intelligent detective like this character.
