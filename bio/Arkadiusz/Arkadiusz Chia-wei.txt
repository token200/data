**Personality:** Arkadiusz is a complex and multifaceted individual with a strong sense of identity. He is fiercely determined and courageous, willing to take risks to protect his heritage and fight for what he believes in. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for the old traditions and customs that connect him to his Taiwanese mother's culture, and he is also deeply rooted in his Polish father's discipline and stoicism. As a result, Arkadiusz possesses a unique blend of courage, adaptability, and determination.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright hazel with golden flecks, reflecting his mixed Asian heritage
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a messy, spiky style that accentuates his angular features
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent cheekbones, and piercing hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with intensity

**Interests:** Arkadiusz is passionate about martial arts, particularly tai chi and Wing Chun. He sees these disciplines as a way to balance his Polish father's discipline with his Taiwanese mother's emphasis on harmony and balance. When not training or fighting for his heritage, he enjoys exploring the city streets of Krakow and Taipei, taking in the sights and sounds of both cultures.

Additionally, Arkadiusz has a deep love for traditional music and dance, particularly the folk traditions of Poland and Taiwan. He often listens to old records by Polish composer Witold Lutos≈Çawski or Taiwanese musician Tu An-Shen while training, finding inspiration in their unique melodies and rhythms.
