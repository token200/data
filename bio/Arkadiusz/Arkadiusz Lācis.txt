Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Arkadiusz Lācis's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arkadiusz Lācis appears to be a complex individual with a mix of traits. On one hand, he has a reputation for being cunning and skilled as a master thief, earning him the nickname "The Ghost of Moscow." This suggests that he is intelligent, resourceful, and confident in his abilities. However, his hesitation and questioning about the cost of his actions imply that he may also be introspective, calculating, and potentially haunted by his past experiences.

Additionally, Lācis seems to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by his raised eyebrow and "hint of mischief" in his eyes when planning the heist. This suggests that he has a playful side, but one that is still guarded and calculated.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Lācis's height is not specified, but based on the luxurious penthouse apartment he inhabits, it is likely that he is of average to above-average height, possibly around 5'10" (178 cm) or taller.
* Eye Color: His eye color is also not explicitly mentioned, but given his Russian background and affinity for sophistication, it's possible that he has piercing blue eyes or dark brown eyes with a hint of grey.

**Interests:** Lācis's interests appear to be centered around high-stakes thievery, rare artifacts, and outsmarting his adversaries. He is drawn to the thrill of the chase and seems to have an affinity for masterpieces like Fabergé eggs. However, this interest comes with a cost, as evidenced by his hesitations about previous jobs.

He also has a fascination with art, history, and perhaps even luxury living (given his penthouse apartment). Lācis's past experience with the KGB suggests that he may have had interests in espionage, politics, or international relations.

It is worth noting that Lācis seems to be an individual who walks the line between risk-taking and caution. He has a calculated approach, weighing the pros and cons before making his next move. This duality suggests that he values freedom and control over his own destiny, which may drive his pursuit of rare artifacts and outwitting those who seek to exploit him.
