**Personality:** Arkadiusz del Toro is a complex and mysterious individual. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which stems from his troubled past as a member of an elite Polish special forces unit. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, often masking his true emotions beneath a stoic exterior. Arkadiusz is driven by a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to take risks when protecting those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:** Arkadiusz stands at 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with an athletic build honed from years of combat training. His piercing green eyes are his most striking feature, with a sharp, intelligent glint that misses nothing. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, while his chiseled features - including a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones - give him an air of rugged masculinity.

**Interests:** Arkadiusz's interests are centered around his work as an operative, although he has shown a deep appreciation for history and archaeology. He is fascinated by the secrets and mysteries hidden within ancient artifacts, and his experience in Eastern Europe has given him a unique perspective on the region's rich cultural heritage. When not on a mission, Arkadiusz enjoys exploring urban landscapes and sipping whiskey, often lost in thought as he contemplates the complexities of the world around him.

As an operative, Arkadiusz is drawn to high-stakes missions that require his particular set of skills - stealth, strategy, and combat expertise. He has a strong sense of loyalty to those who have earned his trust, particularly Marcus Thompson, and will go to great lengths to protect them.
