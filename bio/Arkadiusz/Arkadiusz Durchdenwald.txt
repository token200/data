He is an avid observer of human behavior and has a keen eye for detail, which allows him to notice patterns and connections that others may miss. In his free time, he enjoys long walks through the city, listening to jazz music, and reading about philosophy and psychology.

**Background:** As a retired accountant from Warsaw, Dutch spent years working for the Polish government, developing his analytical skills and building a network of contacts in the underworld. His expertise as an accountant also gave him access to information that others didn't have, making him a valuable asset in the investigation.

**Skills:** Dutch is a master of pattern recognition, able to connect seemingly unrelated dots and spot inconsistencies that others may overlook. He is also an expert at gathering intelligence and interviewing witnesses without raising suspicion.
