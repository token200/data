Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Arkadiusz Bergstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arkadiusz Bergstrom is a man of mystery with an air of quiet confidence. He commands attention without demanding it, suggesting that he has a calm and collected demeanor that can be unsettling to those who don't know him. His ability to build a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld implies that he is a master manipulator, able to blend into different environments and adopt various personas.

**Physical Attributes:** Arkadiusz Bergstrom's physical appearance is not fully described in the story, but we can make some educated guesses based on his profession. As a historian and mercenary, he likely spends most of his time indoors, where he may have had less opportunity to develop a robust physique. However, as a ruthless mercenary, he might be fit enough to handle himself in combat situations.

Assuming the story's 19th-century Scandinavian folk music preference is indicative of Arkadiusz Bergstrom's personal taste, we can infer that his cultural background and upbringing may have influenced his physical appearance. He might have fair skin, blue or green eyes (common in Scandinavian cultures), and a slightly rugged or weathered complexion from spending time outdoors.

For the sake of completeness, let's assign Arkadiusz Bergstrom a height of around 5'11" (180 cm) to 6'1" (185 cm), which would make him slightly above average height for a European male. His eye color could be blue or green, with darker hair that frames his face.

**Interests:** As a historian, Arkadiusz Bergstrom likely has a deep appreciation for ancient texts, manuscripts, and other historical artifacts. He might be particularly interested in Scandinavian history, folklore, and mythology, given his affinity for 19th-century Scandinavian folk music.

As a mercenary, Arkadiusz Bergstrom's interests may shift towards more practical pursuits, such as strategy, tactics, and deception. He would likely have an interest in learning about various forms of espionage, surveillance techniques, and other methods used by spies and assassins.

In his free time, Arkadiusz Bergstrom might enjoy listening to 19th-century Scandinavian folk music or reading historical texts by candlelight, much like he did in his apartment.
