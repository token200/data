Here's a summary of Arkadiusz Sundlöf's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arkadiusz is a complex and guarded individual. His years of solitude have made him introverted and reserved, causing him to be hesitant in opening up to others. Despite this, he has a deep emotional depth, which is reflected in his haunting music. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to shield himself from connection with others, but there's a hint of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior.

**Physical Attributes:** Arkadiusz stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often unkempt and falling across his forehead in messy locks. His eyes are an intense, piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline and sharp features, which give him a striking appearance.

**Interests:** As a wandering bard, Arkadiusz's primary interest is music. He is deeply passionate about his craft, using it as a means of expression and storytelling. His instrument of choice is the lute, which he plays with incredible skill and emotion. He also enjoys traveling, exploring new lands, and experiencing different cultures, which often inspire him to create new songs and stories.

In addition to music, Arkadiusz has a fascination with history, mythology, and folklore. He is drawn to tales of love, loss, and tragedy, which he weaves into his own songs and stories. His instrument case contains a treasure trove of melodies, ballads, and epics, each one reflecting a different aspect of his personality.

Despite his love for solitude, Arkadiusz has a deep appreciation for human connection and emotions. He is drawn to people like the young woman who sat beside him in the tavern – those who can see beyond his guarded exterior and understand the depths of his music.
