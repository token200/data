**Interests:**
Giorgia is a creative force to be reckoned with, with a deep love for art, music, and literature. She spends her days scribbling in her journal, reading the works of her favorite authors, or practicing her own writing. At night, she's often found attending impromptu concerts, poetry readings, or late-night conversations with like-minded souls. Her creativity is her greatest strength, but it also presents its challenges, as she struggles to balance her artistic expression with the demands of a more practical life.
