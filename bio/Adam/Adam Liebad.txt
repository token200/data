He is a former hitman turned mercenary, which suggests he has experience in high-stakes operations and may have had to make difficult choices to survive in his line of work. His skills are unparalleled, but this implies that he may be haunted by past mistakes or traumas. Adam seems pragmatic and calculating, weighing the risks and potential rewards of a job before making a decision.
