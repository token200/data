Here's a summary of Adam Dupuis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Adam is a complex individual with a mix of vulnerability and determination. As the son of a wealthy shipping magnate, he was expected to take over the family business, but after a near-fatal accident, he had to reevaluate his priorities. He's haunted by the memory of his mother's passing when he was a child, which has left emotional scars. Adam is quiet and introspective, often relying on solitude to clear his mind and recharge. However, when it comes to Emily, he opens up and shows a more vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a hint of green around the edges
* Other notable features: Adam has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow from his sailing accident. His hair is dark brown and usually kept neat and tidy.

**Interests:** 

* Sailing and fishing (Adam used to spend hours doing these activities as a teenager, but had to put them on hold due to the accident)
* Music: Adam plays the guitar and enjoys listening to folk music, which often helps him process his emotions
* Philosophy and self-discovery: As someone who's struggled with his identity and purpose, Adam is drawn to introspection and seeking meaning in life

Adam's interests reflect his love for nature, solitude, and creativity. He's also deeply invested in finding his true path and overcoming the expectations placed upon him by his family.

It's worth noting that while Adam has a strong sense of duty towards his family business, he's not yet fully committed to it. This inner conflict makes him more nuanced and relatable, as he grapples with the tension between his responsibilities and his own desires.
