I'll choose the first option to create a summary for Adam Bērziņš. Here's a short summary:

Adam Bērziņš is a 25-year-old Latvian artist with an unconventional sense of style and creativity. He stands at 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with an athletic build that often comes in handy when exploring the city's rooftops or navigating through crowded streets. His eyes are an arresting shade of bright blue, almost sky-blue, which seem to sparkle with inspiration whenever he's working on a new piece.

As a painter, Adam is fiercely passionate and constantly seeking new ways to express himself. He spends most of his days wandering the streets of Riga, taking in the city's vibrant atmosphere and sketching out ideas that often come to life in his studio at night. His art pieces are a unique blend of traditional Latvian folk motifs with modern street art elements, which has gained him a growing following among locals and visitors alike.

When he's not painting, Adam can be found sipping coffee at local cafes or practicing yoga to maintain his flexibility and balance – essential skills for navigating the city's uneven streets. He dreams of one day showcasing his work in galleries across Europe and making a name for himself as a rising star in the Latvian art scene.
