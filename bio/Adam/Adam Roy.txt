Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Adam Roy. However, I can still help create a profile for this character by making some assumptions based on common traits found in characters with similar names.

Let's assume that Adam Roy is a main character from a young adult science fiction novel. Here's a possible summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Adam Roy is a brilliant and resourceful 17-year-old who has grown up on the streets of a dystopian city. He's fiercely independent and determined to uncover the truth about his missing parents, who were scientists working on a top-secret project. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect his friends and family.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, thanks to years of living on the streets and engaging in street fighting

**Interests:** Adam is passionate about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. He's particularly skilled at hacking and coding, which he uses to gather information and stay one step ahead of his enemies. In his free time, he enjoys tinkering with gadgets and machines, often sneaking into abandoned buildings to scavenge for parts.

Feel free to modify or discard any of these attributes as you see fit! If you'd like to create a new story featuring Adam Roy, I'd be happy to help craft an entertaining tale. What kind of story would you like it to be?
