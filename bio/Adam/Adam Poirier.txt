Here is a summary of Adam Poirier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Adam is 5'11" (180 cm) tall with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his brooding intensity. His eyes are a piercing blue that seem to see right through you. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which he got while exploring abandoned buildings.

**Personality:**
Adam is a curious and adventurous individual with a fascination for the darker side of life. He's drawn to the unknown and the supernatural, often feeling more alive when he's investigating abandoned buildings or exploring creepy locations. Despite this fascination, Adam has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, once you get to know him, he reveals a deep empathy and understanding for others.

**Interests:**
Adam is an avid photographer and writer, using his skills to capture the eerie beauty of abandoned buildings and explore the darker corners of society. He's particularly interested in urban exploration, the supernatural, and the paranormal. When not working on his freelance writing projects, Adam can be found researching new locations for his photography projects or pouring over dusty tomes in local libraries and thrift stores.

**Hobbies:**
Adam enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and exploring abandoned buildings (as you might have guessed). He's also an avid fan of true crime podcasts and horror movies, often finding inspiration for his writing from these sources. When he's not working or exploring, Adam likes to curl up with a good book and a cup of black coffee, lost in the world of his own making.

**Quirks:**
Adam has a habit of talking to himself when he's nervous or deep in thought, often muttering phrases like "Get out while you still can" (in reference to the infamous mansion whisper). He's also a bit of a hoarder, collecting strange trinkets and oddities from his photography adventures. Despite this, Adam is always impeccably dressed, often favoring dark jeans, leather jackets, and chunky boots that add to his edgy aesthetic.
