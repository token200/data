Based on the short story, I've created a new fictional character profile for Kristīne Young:

**Physical Attributes:**
Kristīne is a 25-year-old woman with an athletic yet slender build. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall and has long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait she inherited from her mother. She often wears her hair tied up in a ponytail and favors comfortable clothing suitable for her freelance writing lifestyle.

**Personality:**
Kristīne is a curious and determined individual with an insatiable thirst for knowledge about the paranormal. Her fascination with the supernatural drives her to investigate even the most unlikely of places, as seen in her nocturnal exploration of the abandoned asylum. Despite feeling scared or uneasy at times, Kristīne remains resolute and focused on uncovering the truth. She's a bit introverted but has a strong sense of adventure and is not afraid to take risks.

**Interests:**
Kristīne is passionate about writing, research, and investigation. Her interests extend beyond ghost hunting to various fields of study, including parapsychology, cryptography, and folklore. In her free time, she enjoys reading books on history, mythology, and the supernatural. She's also an avid fan of horror movies and loves listening to paranormal-themed podcasts while working on her writing projects.

**Other Details:**
Kristīne is a self-taught writer with a degree in English literature from a local university. She works freelance as a writer, producing articles for various online publications and websites that focus on true crime, ghost stories, and paranormal topics. Her love of ghost hunting has led her to develop some unique skills, including proficiency in using EMF meters and digital audio recorders, which she uses to capture evidence of paranormal activity.

I hope this character profile captures the essence of Kristīne Young from the short story!
