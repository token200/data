Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Tamas Webb:

**Personality:** Tamas Webb is a man with an air of quiet confidence, hinting at a mysterious past. He exudes a sense of caution and warning, suggesting that he's a force to be reckoned with. However, despite his formidable background as a former intelligence operative, he comes across as grounded and down-to-earth, preferring the quiet life as a freelance consultant.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown, cut short and neatly styled
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a high level of physical fitness

It's not mentioned in the original story what Tamas' face looks like beyond his piercing green eyes, so I've made some assumptions:

* Face Shape: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a determined expression
* Skin Tone: Tanned, with a hint of ruggedness from spending time outdoors
* Facial Hair: Clean-shaven, with a subtle stubble that hints at his mature age

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Tamas Webb is interested in:

* Freelance consulting work, possibly involving covert operations or intelligence gathering
* A quiet life and avoiding unnecessary risks
* Meeting new people, particularly women with a strong sense of purpose (as seen with Emily)
* Discovering hidden gems, such as the old caf√© "The Whispering Walls"
* Possibly reconnecting with his past or seeking redemption

However, it's also clear that Tamas Webb is drawn to Emily and their chance encounter sparks something new within him.
