**Additional Details:**

Tamas Briedis has an impressive right hand, slightly larger than his left due to a childhood injury that led him to practice with his non-dominant hand for a time. This unique adaptation has actually improved his coordination and overall dexterity as a pianist.

As a child, he was known for his precocious talent, often performing small pieces in front of family gatherings or at local talent shows. His parents, though initially concerned about the demands of a musical career, eventually became his biggest supporters.

Tamas Briedis's Steinway piano is an antique model that has been lovingly maintained and customized by him to suit his playing style. It's said that he can play this instrument for hours without feeling any fatigue or strain, as if the music becomes an integral part of his very being.
