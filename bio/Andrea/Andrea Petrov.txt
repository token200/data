**Personality:**

Andrea is a curious and determined individual, driven by a passion for uncovering hidden truths and unraveling mysteries. She has a introspective nature, often lost in thought as she ponders the complexities of history and human experience. Despite this introspection, Andrea is not averse to taking risks or facing her fears head-on when it comes to pursuing her goals. Her dry wit and quick intelligence make her a compelling conversationalist, but also sometimes lead her to be perceived as aloof or standoffish by those who don't know her.

**Interests:**

* History (particularly Venetian history)
* Archaeology
* Local legends and folklore
* Ancient languages (including Latin, Italian, and Greek)
* Astronomy and mathematics (as embodied in Arianna della Torre's life story)
* Research and scholarship (especially when it comes to uncovering new knowledge or challenging existing narratives)

As a historian, Andrea is drawn to the stories behind Venice's iconic landmarks, its hidden secrets, and the whispers of a past that refuses to stay buried. Her research has led her to become increasingly fascinated by the life and legacy of Arianna della Torre, an enigmatic woman from 14th century Venice who was said to have been an outcast among her family for her unconventional love of astronomy and mathematics.
