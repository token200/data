**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)

**Personality:**

* Zheng is a free-spirited individual who values independence and spontaneity. He's always up for an adventure and isn't afraid to take risks.
* Despite his carefree nature, Zheng has a compassionate heart and is fiercely loyal to those he cares about.
* He's quick-witted and can often be found cracking jokes or making witty remarks, which can sometimes get him into trouble.

**Interests:**

Zheng was born in Poland but grew up moving between cities due to his parents' work. This nomadic upbringing has made him adaptable and resilient, with a strong sense of self-reliance. He currently resides in Berlin, where he's building a life as a musician and exploring the city's vibrant art and food scenes.
