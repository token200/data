Here is a short summary of Zheng Liebad's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Zheng Liebad stands at an impressive height of 6 feet 5 inches (196 cm), with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His raven-black hair is tied back in a ponytail, revealing a strong jawline and a nose that has been broken at least once, giving him a rugged and battle-hardened appearance. He wears his armor with pride, adorned with the emblem of his clan: a golden dragon coiled around a crimson sword.

**Personality:**
Zheng Liebad is a fiercely dedicated and just individual, driven by a strong sense of duty to protect the innocent and fight against injustice. His bravery in battle is matched only by his unwavering compassion for those who have been wronged. Despite his fearsome reputation, he has a humble heart and a deep connection to the land and its people.

**Interests:**
Zheng Liebad's interests are largely centered around his duties as a warrior and a protector of the innocent. However, before his warrior days, he was once a humble farmer who tended to his family's fields under the watchful eye of the mountains. This experience instilled in him a deep love for nature and a strong connection to the cycles of life and death. He also has a fascination with the ancient traditions and customs of his clan, which are reflected in the emblem on his armor: the golden dragon coiled around a crimson sword.

It's worth noting that few details about Zheng Liebad's personal interests or hobbies beyond farming were mentioned in the original story, so some of these details have been inferred based on the context.
