I'd be happy to create a character profile for Zheng Jensen.

**Physical Attributes:**
Zheng is 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build. He has short, dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp facial features. His piercing green eyes seem to sparkle with mischief, hinting at his adventurous spirit. Zheng has a small tattoo of a dragon on his left shoulder blade, a symbol he obtained during his travels.

**Personality:**
Zheng is a free-spirited individual who lives life on his own terms. He's fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. This trait can sometimes make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but beneath his tough exterior lies a compassionate heart and a strong sense of justice.

Zheng is also deeply curious, with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and experience. He's always been drawn to the unknown, and has spent years exploring the world, learning new languages, and immersing himself in different cultures.

**Interests:**
Zheng is passionate about photography, music, and poetry. He loves capturing the beauty of the world through his lens, whether it's the breathtaking landscapes he's encountered on his travels or the intimate moments he's shared with friends and strangers alike.

As a musician, Zheng plays the guitar with a raw intensity that belies his introspective nature. His music is a reflection of his wanderlust and love of life, often incorporating elements of folk, rock, and world music into his compositions.

When it comes to poetry, Zheng has always been drawn to the spoken word scene. He finds solace in the rhythm and cadence of language, using words to express emotions and ideas that might be difficult to put into written form.

**Background:**
Zheng hails from a small town in rural China, where he grew up surrounded by the rolling hills and verdant forests of his childhood. As a young man, he became restless, feeling confined by the expectations of those around him. He set out on a journey of self-discovery, traveling extensively throughout Asia and Europe before eventually settling in a bustling city.

Now, at 25 years old, Zheng is determined to make his mark on the world through his art, whether it's through photography, music, or poetry. His life is a canvas waiting for him to create, and he's eager to see what adventures lie ahead.
