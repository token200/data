Despite this, he has a compassionate heart and will go out of his way to help those in need. Zheng is highly intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and solve complex problems with ease.

**Interests:**
Zheng Toffoli's passions include cryptography, ancient history, and alchemy. He spends most of his free time studying the works of forgotten alchemists, deciphering cryptic texts, or experimenting with new recipes for magical potions. When he's not indulging in these intellectual pursuits, Zheng can be found exploring hidden corners of the world, searching for rare artifacts, or competing in underground puzzle-solving tournaments.
