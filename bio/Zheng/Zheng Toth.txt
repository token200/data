Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Zheng Toth:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing indigo, often described as an unsettling shade of blue that seems almost otherworldly
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, unkempt manner that adds to his enigmatic aura
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique honed from years of martial arts training

**Personality:**

* Intelligent and analytical, with an insatiable curiosity that drives him to uncover the truth
* Resourceful and adaptable, able to think on his feet and navigate complex situations with ease
* Guarded and introspective, with a tendency to keep people at arm's length due to past experiences
* Strong sense of justice and a deep commitment to using his skills for the greater good

**Interests:**

* Alchemy and the study of ancient texts, particularly those related to mysticism and the occult
* Martial arts, particularly Tai Chi and qigong, which he practices as a means of maintaining balance and focus
* The art of detective work and puzzle-solving, which he enjoys as a intellectual challenge
* Music, specifically traditional Chinese instruments like the pipa and erhu, which he finds calming and meditative

**Other Details:**

* Zheng Toth is a non-smoker and has a rare medical condition that makes him highly sensitive to toxins and pollutants.
* He is an expert in multiple languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and Japanese.
* Despite his tough exterior, Zheng has a soft spot for stray animals and often takes in lost or injured creatures as "students" under his care.

Feel free to modify or discard any of these details as you see fit. If you'd like me to generate a new story based on this character profile, I'm here to help!
