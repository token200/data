Since there is no information about the character Zheng Välja, I will create a fictional summary based on general characteristics. Please note that this is an assumption and might not align with the actual character from your story.

Zheng Välja appears to be in his mid-twenties, standing at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall with a lean yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a short, messy manner, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost appearing blue in certain lighting conditions.

As for personality, Zheng Välja seems to be introverted and observant, preferring to listen rather than speak. He has a dry sense of humor, which he uses to deflect from serious conversations. Despite this, those close to him know that he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect his friends.

In terms of interests, Zheng Välja appears to be well-versed in history, particularly the cultural and political nuances of ancient civilizations. He is an avid reader, often spending hours pouring over dusty tomes in local libraries. When not studying, he enjoys long walks in the countryside, taking in the sights and sounds of nature.

Again, please note that these attributes are purely speculative, based on a lack of information about the character Zheng Välja from your story.
