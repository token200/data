I think there's been a misunderstanding! Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Jansons, I'd love to create one for you.

Let's assume Zheng Jansons is a 25-year-old protagonist from a science fiction novel. Here's a brief summary of their personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Name:** Zheng Jianson (Zheng is his first name, and Jianson is his last name)

**Background:** Zheng hails from a small, coastal town in China, where he grew up surrounded by the ocean and learned to appreciate its beauty. He's always been fascinated by marine biology and the mysteries of the deep sea.
