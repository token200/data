Since Zheng Krūmiņa is not a real character, I will create a fictional profile for him.

**Physical Attributes:**
Zheng Krūmiņa stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often sticking up in every direction. His eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which can be both captivating and intimidating to those who meet him. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Zheng Krūmiņa is a complex and intriguing individual. On the surface, he appears confident and charismatic, with a quick wit and sharp tongue that can disarm even the most skeptical of individuals. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply introspective and emotionally guarded person who struggles to open up to others. He has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

**Interests:**
Zheng Krūmiņa is passionate about martial arts, particularly the ancient art of Kung Fu. He is a skilled practitioner and spends countless hours training and perfecting his techniques. In addition to his love for combat sports, he also has a fascination with philosophy and psychology, often finding himself lost in books on existentialism and neuroscience.
