I'm happy to create a fictional character profile for Zheng Koch! Since there's no existing context or information about this character, I'll take creative liberties to craft a unique personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Physical Attributes:**
Zheng Koch is of Asian descent with a slender yet athletic build. He stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an average weight for his height. His short, dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, spiky fashion, while his bright hazel eyes seem to sparkle with curiosity. His facial features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a small nose.

**Personality:**
Zheng Koch is a free-spirited individual who values independence and self-reliance. He's fiercely loyal to those he cares about but has a hard time opening up to new people due to past experiences. Despite this, he possesses a quick wit, sharp intellect, and exceptional problem-solving skills. Zheng is naturally curious and enjoys exploring uncharted territories, both physically and intellectually.

**Interests:**
Zheng Koch is an avid fan of geocaching (treasure hunting using GPS coordinates), rock climbing, and martial arts. He's also an accomplished pianist with a passion for classical music. In his free time, he loves to read historical fiction novels, particularly those centered around Asian cultures and mythology.

**Additional Details:**
Zheng Koch grew up in a small town surrounded by mountains and forests. As a child, he spent countless hours exploring the woods, collecting leaves and rocks, and listening to the stories of his grandmother, who was an expert in traditional medicine. These experiences instilled in him a deep respect for nature and a desire to learn more about the world around him.

Now that I've created Zheng Koch's character profile, I'm excited to help you develop a story featuring this intriguing individual! If you'd like, I can suggest some story ideas or prompts to get us started.
