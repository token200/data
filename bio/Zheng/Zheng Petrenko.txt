Based on the character profile provided, I will create a fictional character description for Zheng Petrenko:

**Physical Attributes:**
Zheng Petrenko stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, a rare and striking color that seems almost otherworldly in the dim light of the Carpathian Mountains. Her dark hair is often tied back in a messy bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.

**Personality:**
Zheng Petrenko is a fiercely determined and independent individual, driven by an insatiable curiosity about her family's past. She possesses a sharp mind and a quick wit, honed from years of investigating complex stories in local newspapers and online publications. Her background as a freelance journalist has taught her to navigate the gray areas between truth and rumor with ease. Despite her tough exterior, Zheng has a compassionate side, which she only reveals to those closest to her.

**Interests:**
Zheng Petrenko is deeply passionate about unraveling mysteries and uncovering hidden truths. Her interest in journalism is rivaled only by her fascination with folklore, mythology, and the supernatural. As she delves deeper into the world of Transylvanian legends, Zheng becomes increasingly enthralled by the stories of witchcraft, curses, and forbidden love that seem to be woven into the fabric of her family's history.

**Habits:**
Zheng Petrenko is often seen carrying a well-worn camera slung around her neck, capturing every moment of her investigation. She has a fondness for traditional Romanian clothing, particularly the intricately embroidered blouses worn by local women, and can often be found sipping strong coffee at rural taverns, striking up conversations with strangers about their lives and stories.

**Quirks:**
Zheng Petrenko has an uncanny ability to sense the presence of others when she's alone, as if her intuition is trying to guide her toward some hidden truth. She also possesses a peculiar habit of muttering fragments of Romanian folklore phrases under her breath, which she believes helps her focus her thoughts and connect with the world around her.

With these character traits in mind, Zheng Petrenko emerges as a complex, multifaceted individual driven by a burning desire to uncover the secrets of her family's past and confront the darkness that has haunted them for so long.
