Here is a summary of the fictional character Inoue Harris:

**Physical Attributes:**
Inoue Harris stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) tall. His hair is dark brown and often styled neatly, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep brown, often hidden behind wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose.

**Personality:**
Harris's reserved demeanor can be deceiving; beneath his unassuming exterior lies a sharp mind and a quick wit. As the head of the Intergalactic Union's research division, he exudes confidence in his work, but his passion for music reveals a more introverted side to his personality.

**Interests:**
In addition to his love for music (he's particularly fond of Earth genres such as rock and hip-hop), Harris is an avid enthusiast of scientific discovery and exploration. He finds solace in the vastness of space, often spending hours lost in thought, contemplating the mysteries of the universe.

When not working or investigating new phenomena, Harris enjoys belting out his favorite tunes on his holophone player - much to the amusement (or confusion) of those around him.
