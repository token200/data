**Personality:** Inoue Koval is an enigmatic figure with a mysterious persona. He has grown disillusioned with the rigid code of conduct that governed his military life, indicating a strong desire for individuality and self-expression. As he navigates his new path as an artist, he begins to shed his old skin and reveal a more authentic, creative person. This suggests that he is open to change, willing to take risks, and passionate about expressing himself truthfully.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no detailed information is provided in the short story about Inoue Koval's physical appearance. However, I can make an educated guess based on his background as a former member of Japan's elite Special Forces unit. It's likely that he has a strong build and stands around 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with piercing brown or gray eyes (as is common in Japanese culture). His dark hair could be styled neatly, reflecting his military past.

**Interests:** Inoue Koval's primary interest lies in art, specifically painting. He discovers a love for bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors, using these techniques to express himself in ways he never thought possible. This newfound passion is encouraged by Akira, the leader of the underground art collective, who sees the potential for creativity and self-discovery in him.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Inoue Koval may also be interested in exploring themes related to identity, spirituality, or personal growth, as hinted at by his journey from a life of discipline to one of creative expression.
