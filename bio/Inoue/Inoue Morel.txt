These moments of serendipity allow her to tap into the world's collective energy, which she then translates into her art.

Despite her seemingly reserved nature, Inoue has a deep sense of humor and can be playful when those around her are able to crack her enigmatic facade. Her wit is dry and observational, often leaving onlookers puzzled and intrigued by her unspoken thoughts and observations.
