Here is a summary of Inoue Kovács' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Inoue Kovács is known for his unyielding dedication to his craft, but also remains humble and kind. He is a natural leader who takes great joy in seeing his students progress and grow. Despite his reputation as a formidable opponent, he is always willing to offer words of encouragement and advice when needed. His fierce determination and passion for Judo are inspiring, and he has a strong sense of pride and satisfaction in sharing his knowledge with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Inoue Kovács stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of intense physical conditioning. His eyes are a piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets, conveying a sense of intensity and focus. His dark hair is often worn in a simple style, framing his weathered face and emphasizing his strong jawline.

**Interests:** Inoue Kovács' primary interest is Judo, the martial art he has dedicated his life to mastering. He sees it as more than just a physical discipline – it's a way of life that teaches mental discipline and self-control. Outside of Judo, he values simplicity and humility, preferring quiet evenings spent reflecting on his practice rather than indulging in flashy luxuries.

It is worth noting that there are no specific interests mentioned in the original short story beyond Judo. Therefore, I've kept the interests relatively minimal and focused on his primary passion.
