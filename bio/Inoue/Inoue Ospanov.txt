Ospanov is a master manipulator, always staying one step ahead of those around him. He possesses a quick wit, a sharp tongue, and an unnerving ability to read people's emotions. His calm demeanor belies a fierce determination and unyielding independence, making him a formidable opponent in both the cat-and-mouse game with Kabanov and in his dealings with others.
