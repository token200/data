She is confident in her art and unapologetic about her mixed heritage, often incorporating traditional Japanese and Mexican symbols into her work. Despite her passion for her craft, she can be introverted and reserved at times, preferring to spend hours alone in her studio lost in thought. However, when she does open up, her enthusiasm is infectious, and her kindness and empathy make her a beloved figure in the art community.

She is particularly drawn to the works of Japanese artists like Hokusai and Hiroshige, as well as Mexican muralists like Diego Rivera.

She is also an avid reader, devouring books on art history, philosophy, and social justice to fuel her creativity and inspire her work.
