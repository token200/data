Based on the inspiration from Martina Navratilova's story, I've created a fictional character profile for Mats Navratilova:

**Name:** Mats Navratilova

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue
- Hair Color: Dark brown
- Skin Tone: Olive with a warm glow from spending time outdoors

**Personality:**
Mats is an ambitious and determined individual, often described as fierce and passionate. She has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to speak her mind when she believes it's necessary. Mats values honesty, hard work, and loyalty above all else, making her a loyal friend and partner.

**Interests:**
- Tennis (of course!)
- Hiking and exploring nature
- Cooking and trying new recipes
- Reading about history and philosophy
- Volunteering for social causes, particularly those supporting the LGBTQ+ community

As a fictional character, Mats Navratilova would likely be an avid tennis player with a strong competitive spirit. Her athletic prowess on the court would be matched by her adventurous spirit off it. While she shares some similarities with Martina Navratilova's drive and determination, Mats has her own unique personality traits that set her apart as a fictional character.
