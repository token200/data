He has a gentle demeanor, allowing him to build trust with the villagers he meets on his travels. His eyes light up when discussing mythical creatures and ancient gods, revealing a deep enthusiasm for the subject matter.

Mats is also a listener, preferring to absorb stories rather than being the center of attention. This allows him to form strong connections with the people he meets, who appreciate his genuine interest in their tales.
