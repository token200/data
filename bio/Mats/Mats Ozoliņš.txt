Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a character profile for Mats Ozoliņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mats Ozoliņš stands at about 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with creativity. His hair is dark brown and unruly, often falling across his forehead in loose waves. He has a strong jawline and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose, giving him a charmingly rugged appearance.

**Personality:**
Mats is a free-spirited and imaginative individual with a deep connection to nature. He's curious, passionate, and always eager to explore the world around him. His creativity knows no bounds, and he's constantly seeking new ways to express himself through art. Mats has a playful sense of humor and enjoys making people smile. Despite his artistic temperament, he's surprisingly practical and resourceful, often finding innovative solutions to problems.

**Interests:**
Mats is an avid naturalist, spending hours studying the flora and fauna of the forest surrounding his home. He's particularly fascinated by the intricate patterns found in nature – from the swirling shapes of leaves to the geometric structures of rocks. He loves to collect unusual materials for his art, such as driftwood, feathers, and other organic textures that inspire him.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Mats enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and practicing yoga. He's also a bit of a bookworm, devouring volumes on philosophy, botany, and the natural world. When he's not creating art or exploring the outdoors, you can find Mats curled up with a good book or sipping tea in his cozy studio.

This character profile is just a starting point, and I'm happy to add or modify attributes to suit your specific needs!
