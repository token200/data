Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mats Young's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Mats Young stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost black, but with an iridescent sheen that hints at the secrets they hold. His dark hair is always slightly unkempt, framing his face with a mysterious intensity. Mats has a small tattoo of a lyre on his left wrist and wears a silver watch with a broken chain.

**Personality:** Mats is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. He exudes an aura of quiet confidence and intensity, making those around him feel both drawn to and intimidated by him. Despite his reserved nature, he has a deep passion for art, music, and storytelling, which drives him to explore new places and connect with people.

**Interests:** Mats is a creative soul who finds solace in art, music, and writing (he can still sketch and create intricate patterns with his finger). He has a fascination with the human experience and the interconnectedness of all things. Mats is drawn to the harmony and discord between people, places, and cultures, which he believes are the building blocks of life's greatest symphonies.

As someone who has lost his voice, Mats has developed new ways to express himself through art, storytelling, and observation. He is particularly interested in exploring the hidden histories and secret corners of towns and cities, where stories and legends come alive. Through Lena, he finds a kindred spirit who shares his passion for creativity and connection, and together they create something new and beautiful.

Mats' ultimate goal is to find a place where art and music merge into one eternal symphony, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy dissolve, and the universe reveals its hidden harmonies.
