Based on the short story about Piotr DiCaprio, I've created a fictional character profile for Piotr DiCaprio:

**Physical Attributes:** Piotr DiCaprio stands at 6'1" with an athletic build. He has piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you, and his dark brown hair is always perfectly messy. His smile can light up a room, and his sharp jawline gives him a strong, confident presence.

**Personality:** Piotr DiCaprio is a free-spirited and adventurous person who lives life on his own terms. He's passionate about his craft as a chef and is always looking for new inspiration to create innovative dishes. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

**Interests:** Piotr DiCaprio is an avid foodie who loves exploring different cuisines and cooking techniques. He's particularly fascinated by French cuisine and has a deep appreciation for the history and culture behind each dish. In his free time, he enjoys practicing yoga, hiking through the French countryside, and attending culinary events to stay up-to-date on the latest trends.

Note: Since I couldn't find any information about Pietro DiCaprio in the DC Comics universe, I created a fictional character profile for Piotr DiCaprio that doesn't share any similarities with Leonardo DiCaprio's Pietro DiCaprio.
