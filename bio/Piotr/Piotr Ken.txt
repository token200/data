Here is a summary of Piotr Ken's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Piotr Ken is a brilliant and resourceful individual with a passion for puzzle-solving. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as somewhat gruff or reserved to those who don't know him. However, once you get to know him, he reveals himself to be fiercely loyal and dedicated to uncovering the truth. His years as a retired detective have also given him a level of introspection and self-awareness, allowing him to approach problems with a unique perspective.

**Physical Attributes:** Piotr Ken is a tall man in his 60s, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). He has graying brown hair that's starting to thin on top, which he often combs over to the side. His eyes are a piercing blue, with deep lines etched into their corners from years of focus and intensity. His face is weathered from years of dealing with the stresses of his job, but his smile still lights up his entire visage.

**Interests:** Piotr Ken's primary interest is solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. As a retired detective, he has spent most of his career honing his skills in this area, and now devotes himself to staying mentally sharp through the study of various puzzles and brain teasers. He is also deeply interested in history, particularly the cases he worked on during his time as a detective. In his free time, Piotr enjoys reading about cryptography and coding theory, which helps him stay ahead of the curve when it comes to complex problems.

Despite being retired, Piotr still finds himself drawn to the thrill of the chase, whether it's an old case or a new mystery that needs solving. His experience as a detective has given him a unique perspective on human nature and behavior, allowing him to approach cases with a level of insight that others may not possess.

With Dr. Lee's enigmatic letter stirring up his interest once again, Piotr is now faced with the challenge of revisiting old wounds and confronting a case he thought was closed. Will his years of experience and expertise be enough to help him crack the mystery, or will this new case prove too much for even a seasoned detective?
