Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Piotr Jansons:

**Physical Attributes:** Piotr Jansons is a tall, imposing figure. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His dark hair is often neatly styled, and his piercing blue eyes are a sharp contrast to the green of Maria's eyes, which he is deeply drawn to.

**Personality:** Piotr is a complex individual, driven by a sense of duty and loyalty. As a former Russian spy turned double agent, he has been conditioned to follow orders without question. However, his feelings for Maria have softened him, making him more empathetic and compassionate. He struggles with his dual identity, torn between his allegiance to the Soviet Union and his growing love for Maria.

**Interests:** Piotr's interests lie in classical music and poetry, which he shares with Maria. His passion for these art forms provides a creative outlet for him and allows him to express emotions that he cannot easily convey as a spy. He is also highly intelligent and resourceful, skills honed from his years of espionage.

**Additional Details:** Piotr's experience as a Russian spy has given him exceptional language skills, particularly in English, which Maria taught him. He is fluent in several languages, including Russian, German, French, and Spanish. Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation allows it.

As Piotr navigates his complicated past and present, these attributes will continue to shape his interactions with Maria and the world around him.
