Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Piotr Alsbach:

**Personality:** Piotr Alsbach is an unorthodox detective with a knack for uncovering hidden truths. He has a confident and determined demeanor, which allows him to approach cases with ease and tenacity. Despite his ability to appear and disappear like a specter, he is not someone to be underestimated - he is fiercely driven by a sense of justice and will stop at nothing to solve a case.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a wiry physique

**Interests:** Piotr Alsbach is deeply interested in solving puzzles and uncovering hidden secrets. He has a fascination with the darker corners of human nature and enjoys delving into the depths of human psychology to understand his clients' motivations and behaviors.

He also appears to have an appreciation for literature and poetry, often finding inspiration in the works of old writers and philosophers. Additionally, he is drawn to the thrill of the chase, and has a passion for investigation that drives him to push boundaries and challenge himself with each new case.

In his downtime, Piotr Alsbach enjoys walking through the city's narrow alleys at night, observing people and buildings from a distance, and pondering the mysteries of the world around him. He is a solitary figure who finds contentment in the quiet moments of reflection, rather than seeking out grand adventures or social thrills.

It's worth noting that Piotr Alsbach has an affinity for being seen as an outsider or an enigma by others - this adds to his "Ghost" persona and allows him to move undetected through the shadows.
