Here is a summary of Piotr Koskinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Piotr Koskinen is a man of few words but strong convictions. He is resourceful, determined, and fiercely independent, having spent years living in hiding to evade the authorities. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and a deep desire for human connection. His past experiences have left him wary of trust, making it challenging for him to open up to new people.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes, a trait inherited from his Russian heritage
* Hair: Short, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy manner

**Interests:** As a former soldier and manual laborer, Piotr has a strong connection to the physical world. He enjoys working with his hands, finding solace in the routine of everyday tasks like gardening or fixing things around the house. Despite his rugged past, he is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, politics, and philosophy to understand the world better. In his free time, Piotr appreciates the beauty of nature, often taking long walks along the waterfront to clear his mind.

It's worth noting that while Leena's piercing blue eyes are mentioned in the story, there is no mention of Piotr having a strong affinity for her eye color or finding it attractive. However, given their growing connection and romantic interest in each other, it's possible that his physical attraction to Leena could develop over time.
