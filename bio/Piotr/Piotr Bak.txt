Here's a summary of the fictional character Piotr Bak:

**Physical Attributes:** Piotr Bak is a tall and slender individual, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). He has piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you, but also hold a deep kindness and warmth. His dark hair is often neatly trimmed, framing his angular face with clean lines. He sports a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds a touch of ruggedness to his otherwise gentle features.

**Personality:** Piotr Bak is a complex and introverted person who has built walls around himself to protect from the pain of his past. However, as he opens up to Kasia, his reserved nature slowly gives way to a dry wit, sharp intellect, and a deep sense of empathy. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about, often putting their needs before his own. Despite his tough exterior, Piotr Bak has a soft spot for children, animals, and underdogs, which makes him an instant magnet for Kasia's compassion.

**Interests:** As a former street dweller turned baker, Piotr Bak is deeply passionate about food, particularly traditional Polish recipes that evoke nostalgia and warmth. He finds solace in the simplicity of baking, where he can lose himself in the rhythms of mixing, kneading, and creating something from scratch. In his free time, Piotr Bak enjoys listening to classical music, reading literature by Cyprian Kamil Norwid, and taking long walks under the stars.

**Background:** Growing up on the streets, Piotr Bak learned to rely only on himself, with no family, friends, or a stable home life. This experience hardened him, but also taught him resilience, resourcefulness, and the value of community. Years later, he discovered his talent for baking and used it as a way to earn a living and build connections in small-town Poland. Despite his efforts to keep to himself, Piotr Bak's past experiences have left emotional scars, which Kasia gently begins to heal through her kindness and friendship.
