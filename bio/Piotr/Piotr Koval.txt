He is a voracious learner, devouring books and seeking out ancient records that might hold clues to his mysterious heritage. He is also a skilled strategist and tactician, often using his intelligence and physical prowess to outmaneuver his enemies. Despite his tough exterior, Piotr has a deep appreciation for art, music, and literature, which he finds solace in when the world around him becomes too much to bear.

**Additional Details:** Piotr's past is marked by tragedy and loss, and he still struggles with PTSD-like symptoms as a result of his early experiences on the streets of Moscow. He has a deep-seated distrust of institutions and authority figures, which often puts him at odds with those who are supposed to be helping him uncover the truth about himself.

Overall, Piotr Koval is a complex and intriguing character, driven by a fierce determination to uncover the secrets of his past and understand who he truly is.
