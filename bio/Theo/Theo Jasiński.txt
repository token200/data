**Personality:** Theo Jasiński is a complex and driven individual. As a former MI6 agent turned private investigator, he has developed a strong sense of determination and resourcefulness.

Despite his tough exterior, Theo has a deep emotional vulnerability, particularly when it comes to his family and personal relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Theo stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build, likely honed from years of physical activity during his MI6 days.

He may also be an avid reader of non-fiction books on psychology, philosophy, or sociology, which would help him better understand human behavior and motivations.

In terms of hobbies, it's possible that Theo enjoys activities that allow him to stay physically active, such as hiking, boxing, or martial arts. These interests would serve as a counterbalance to his intense mental focus on solving cases. Overall, Theo Jasiński is a multi-faceted individual with a rich inner life and a drive that propels him forward in the face of adversity.
