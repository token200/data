Physical Attributes:
Theo Piątek is a woman in her mid-30s. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build. Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which some find unusual but also captivating. Her hair is dark brown and often tied back in a ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose.

Despite her reclusive nature, she possesses an insatiable curiosity about the universe and its secrets. Theo is driven by a sense of wonder and discovery, which often leads her to push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom.

Theo's perfectionism can be intimidating to those who know her, as she has high standards for herself and others. However, this trait also fuels her creativity and innovative thinking, making her one of the most brilliant minds in her field. She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't take the time to get to know her.

Theo's passion for physics and mathematics is matched only by her love for astronomy and astrophysics. She spends countless hours studying the mysteries of dark matter, black holes, and the universe's origins. Her work often takes her down rabbit holes of theoretical calculations and abstract concepts, but she finds this process intellectually stimulating.

In addition to her scientific pursuits, Theo enjoys hiking in remote areas, reading classic literature, and practicing yoga to maintain a balance between her mind and body. She is an avid listener of classical music and finds solace in the works of Polish composers like Frédéric Chopin.

Overall, Theo Piątek is a complex and captivating individual who defies categorization. Her drive for discovery, creativity, and perfection make her an inspiring figure to those who know her, even if she remains elusive to the outside world.
