**Personality:** Theo Yang is described as a "quiet soul," indicating that she may be introverted or reserved. However, this quiet nature belies a strong passion for music and a deep desire to create her own unique sound. She is driven by a sense of liberation when performing, suggesting that music gives her the confidence and freedom she craves.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no detailed description of Theo's physical appearance in the provided text. However, considering her age and background as Momo's younger sister, it can be inferred that she is likely in her late teens or early twenties.

Assuming a typical Korean pop idol appearance, let's estimate that:

* Height: 5'4" (163 cm) - This height is relatively slender, which may suit a K-pop artist with an androgynous or edgy style.
* Eye Color: Dark brown or black - These colors are common among Koreans and may be more fitting for an introverted, creative person like Theo.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, music is Theo's primary passion. She writes songs, experiments with sounds, and pours her heart and soul into every lyric and melody. Her interest in music is evident throughout the text, and it seems to bring her a sense of fulfillment and purpose.
