Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Theo Petrov:

**Personality:** Theo is known as the master tinkerer among his friends, but few know about his true passion for restoring antique clockwork devices. He is a creative and meticulous individual who can coax life out of discarded machinery. His gentle and patient nature allows him to bring beauty and functionality to intricate timepieces. Theo is also someone with a deep sense of nostalgia, fondly reminiscing about his grandfather's workshop and the stories he shared.

**Physical Attributes:** Theo has unkempt hair and worn jeans, giving off an air of being a bit disheveled but in a charming way. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. His eye color is hazel, which complements his weathered skin tone from spending hours working on projects.

**Interests:** Theo's primary interest lies in restoring and maintaining antique clockwork devices, particularly intricate timepieces. He has an immense fascination for the mechanical movements of gears, springs, and other components that come together to create beautiful works of art. His love for clockwork mechanisms drives him to scrounge flea markets, antique shops, and estate sales for rare pieces.

Theo's passion is not limited to just restoring clocks; he also finds inspiration in watching his grandfather repair timepieces as a child. The rhythmic ticking of gears and springs had captivated him, which sparked an interest that has grown over the years into an extraordinary talent.

Outside of clockwork restoration, Theo values storytelling, particularly sharing tales about his grandfather's workshop and clockwork dreams from the past.
