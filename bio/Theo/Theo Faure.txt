**Personality:**
Theo Faure is an enigmatic and introverted person, with a personality as complex as the characters he creates. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms and expectations in his writing. This rebellious streak stems from his own troubled childhood and a deep-seated need for control over his life. Despite his reserved nature, Theo has an unshakeable passion for storytelling and a willingness to take risks that can be both inspiring and intimidating.

While he craves the validation that comes with being a published author, he also finds it stifling to be constantly in the public eye. This duality makes him intensely private, often preferring the company of his writing to social interactions. His creativity is fueled by darkness, both literal (the setting sun outside) and metaphorical (his own emotional turmoil).
