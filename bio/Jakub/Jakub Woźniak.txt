**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Jakub's primary interest is uncovering the truth and telling compelling stories. He seems to have a particular passion for investigating corruption and shedding light on shady dealings within the city's elite. When not working on a story, he likely enjoys sipping coffee in dimly lit cafés like this one, listening to jazz music and absorbing the atmosphere.

It's worth noting that Jakub's background and interests are not fully fleshed out in this short passage, so some of these details can be inferred or added based on his actions and behavior throughout the story.
