Based on the inspiration from Federico Ferugno's life, I've created a fictional character profile for Jakub Ferragni:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, reminiscent of the Italian sky
* Hair Color: Dark brown, with subtle hints of auburn that add warmth to his features
* Skin Tone: Smooth and fair, with a hint of olive undertones from his Milanese heritage

**Personality:**

* Jakub is a visionary with an infectious passion for innovation. He sees the world through the lens of textiles, always searching for ways to push boundaries and create something new.
* His creative energy is contagious, drawing people to him like a magnet. Those who meet him can't help but be drawn into his enthusiasm and excitement for life.
* Despite his success, Jakub remains humble and true to his roots. He believes in empowering others to follow their dreams, just as he did.

**Interests:**

* Textile design and production
* Fashion, of course!
* Exploring the artistic potential of materials and techniques
* Traveling to discover new sources for inspiration and innovative methods
* Collecting rare fabrics and artifacts from his journeys

Jakub's love for textiles is evident in every aspect of his life. He lives for creating something beautiful, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and inspiring others to do the same.
