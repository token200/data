**Occupation:** Antique Book Restorer and Collector

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue with flecks of green, reminiscent of a clear summer sky.
- Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, textured manner that suits his laid-back yet intellectual persona.

Jérôme values knowledge above all else, often becoming so absorbed in his work that time seems to stand still around him. He has a deep respect for the past, believing that understanding its intricacies is essential to forging a better future. His passion for restoration drives him to meticulously preserve every detail of the artifacts he touches, striving to reveal their hidden stories.

Despite his focus on work, Jérôme has a soft spot for art and music – the sounds of old records, violin melodies, or the silent beauty of watercolors are all capable of stirring his soul. In quieter moments, when surrounded by books, maps, or dusty relics, he can become lost in daydreams of far-off lands, lost civilizations, and ancient mysteries waiting to be unraveled.

**Interests:** Jérôme's primary interests lie within the realm of antiquities, particularly rare book restoration, where he spends his days uncovering forgotten stories hidden within yellowed pages. He is also an avid collector of artifacts from all corners of the world, from pre-Columbian pottery to ancient scrolls from forgotten libraries.

In addition to his professional pursuits, Jérôme has a deep fascination with cryptography and codes, often spending his free time deciphering encrypted messages and studying historical ciphers. His love for history extends beyond books to the tangible artifacts themselves – museum visits are a staple of his leisure activities, where he seeks to understand the stories behind the relics.
