**Background:**

As a native of Montevideo, Uruguay, Jérôme grew up with a deep appreciation for art, culture, and the city's rich history. His early life was marked by a sense of restlessness and wanderlust, which eventually led him to become an art thief, earning him the nickname "The Ghost." Over the years, he has honed his skills and developed a reputation for being elusive and untouchable.

Despite his tough exterior, Jérôme has a soft spot for art and culture, and is always on the lookout for new and exciting experiences. His passion for adventure drives him to take risks and push boundaries, often finding himself in precarious situations. However, his sense of loyalty and trustworthiness can be tested, making it difficult for others to get close to him.
