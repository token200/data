Based on the short story, here is a summary of Jérôme White's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jérôme White appears to be a complex individual with multiple personas. On the surface, he is a sophisticated and refined businessman known for his impeccable taste in tailored suits and luxurious cars. However, when it comes to his true passion - underground art - he becomes a man of mystery and intrigue. He is drawn to the beauty of creation and is not afraid to explore the unknown.

Despite his polished exterior, Jérôme seems to be deeply curious about people and their secrets. When he meets Lena, he is immediately drawn to her intelligence, wit, and infectious laughter, but also senses that there may be more to her than meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide detailed physical attributes for Jérôme, so I must rely on inference. However, based on his description as a "successful businessman" with an impeccable taste in tailored suits, it is likely that he has a slender build and stands at around 6 feet tall (183 cm). His eye color is unknown.

**Interests:** As hinted at in the story, Jérôme's true passion is underground art. He spends his nights attending avant-garde performances and admiring provocative installations at an exclusive art club. He is drawn to the beauty of creation and finds solace in the world of art. This passion allows him to escape the high-stakes business world and connect with like-minded individuals who share his love for creativity.

In terms of other interests, Jérôme appears to be interested in philosophy and politics, as evidenced by his engaging conversations with Lena about these topics. He is also drawn to surrealist art, which suggests a more artistic and free-thinking side to his personality.
