**Personality:**
Jérôme Korolev is a complex and enigmatic individual. On the surface, he appears to be charismatic and confident, with an air of mystery that draws people in. However, beneath this façade lies a person driven by curiosity and a desire for puzzle-solving. Jérôme is intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to new situations quickly. He is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries.

Despite his tough exterior, Jérôme has a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity. He struggles with feelings of loyalty and trust, particularly when it comes to those he considers close friends or allies. This inner turmoil can sometimes make him come across as aloof or detached to others, but in reality, he is deeply passionate about the puzzles and codes that drive his work.

**Interests:**
Jérôme Korolev has a profound love for puzzles and codes, which drove him to study the works of great cryptographers. He is fascinated by cryptography, ciphers, and codes, and spends countless hours deciphering complex messages and cracking encrypted files. This passion has become an integral part of his identity, driving him to take risks and push himself to the limits of what is possible.

In addition to puzzles, Jérôme has a fascination with history, particularly the art of espionage and counter-intelligence. He is drawn to the shadowy world of spies and saboteurs, where he feels a sense of belonging among those who operate on the periphery of society.

When not solving puzzles or studying codes, Jérôme enjoys exploring the city's underbelly – from seedy bars to hidden alleyways, he knows them all. He is drawn to the energy of the city at night, when the neon lights and dark alleys come alive with the rhythm of the underworld.
