Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jérôme Krūmiņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jérôme appears to be an intensely focused and driven individual. He prides himself on his attention to detail and razor-sharp mind, suggesting that he values intellectual rigor and precision. However, this focus can also make him somewhat rigid, as evidenced by his initial frustration with his current project. Despite this, Jérôme's curiosity and enthusiasm for new discoveries are clear, indicating a sense of wonder and awe.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide explicit details about Jérôme's physical appearance. However, I will fill in some gaps based on common associations with the character type. Jérôme is likely to be a slender, bespectacled individual with unruly brown hair (a nod to his introspective and analytical nature). His height might be around 5'10" (178 cm), which would make him tall enough to command attention but not so imposing that he overshadows others. As for eye color, I imagine them to be a deep shade of brown or hazel, reflecting his intense focus on intellectual pursuits.

**Interests:** Jérôme's interests seem to revolve around mathematics, particularly fractal geometry and optimization algorithms. His passion for understanding the fundamental laws of the universe suggests that he has a broad appreciation for theoretical physics and cosmology. However, it is also clear that he values discovery and research above all else, often spending hours pouring over papers and running simulations in pursuit of new knowledge.

Additional interests might include:

* Reading widely on topics related to mathematics, physics, and philosophy
* Participating in academic conferences and seminars to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in his field
* Engaging in theoretical discussions with colleagues and friends about the implications of his research
* Exploring connections between mathematics and other disciplines, such as computer science or engineering
