Jérôme has spent years honing his skills, becoming adept at reading people and situations with uncanny ease. He moves through life like a ghost, always aware but never visible on the surface level. His years of working in the spy agency have made him intensely loyal to those he trusts, though this loyalty can be unwavering in its dedication.

- Solitude: Despite his strong sense of loyalty, Jérôme appreciates the value of solitude. He seems content to spend time alone, thinking and observing from the shadows.

His past is shrouded in mystery, and few people know much about his life before joining the spy agency. This lack of transparency has contributed to the air of intrigue that surrounds him, making even the most well-connected individuals wary of approaching him too closely.
