Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jérôme Nowakowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jérôme is a creative and passionate individual who finds solace in his art. Despite struggling with anxiety and self-doubt, he is driven by a strong sense of purpose and determination to share his work with the world. He is introverted and hesitant to put himself out there, but once he finds someone who believes in him, he becomes more confident and open.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes were mentioned in the original story, so I will make some assumptions:

* Height: Jérôme is likely of average height for his age, around 5'9" (175 cm).
* Eye Color: His eye color could be a deep brown or green, reflecting his artistic and introspective personality.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Jérôme's primary interest is painting. He spends most of his time creating art, lost in his own world of colors and emotions. He also values solitude and alone time, often spending hours in his studio apartment surrounded by canvases, paints, and brushes.
