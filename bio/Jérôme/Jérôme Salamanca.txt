**Physical Attributes:** Jérôme Salamanca is a tall and imposing figure, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean yet muscular build. His sharp jawline and piercing gaze command respect, making him a formidable presence in any setting. His eye color is an intense brown that seems to bore into those he meets.
