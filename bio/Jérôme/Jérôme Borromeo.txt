Here is a short summary about Jérôme Borromeo:

Jérôme Borromeo is a charismatic and enigmatic master thief and forger with an unmatched ability to navigate the city's underworld. Physically, he stands at 5'11" (180 cm) tall, with piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with mischief and jet-black hair that frames his chiseled features. He has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of evading capture and pushing himself to the limits.

Jérôme's interests lie in the world of art and antiquities, where he can combine his passion for deception with his expertise as a forger. When not planning and executing daring heists, he enjoys indulging in high-stakes poker games and exploring the city's hidden corners. Despite his charming demeanor, Jérôme is fiercely independent and has few genuine relationships outside of his work with Pierre, his trusted sidekick.

Jérôme's fascination with the art of deception drives him to continually push himself to new heights, always staying one step ahead of his adversaries. His cryptic messages and clever disguises have become legendary among crime lords, who seek his expertise in exchange for substantial sums of money and the thrill of outsmarting their enemies. Those who dare to cross Jérôme, however, will find themselves facing a formidable foe with an unyielding passion for the art of deception.
