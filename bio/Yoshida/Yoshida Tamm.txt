**Physical Attributes:** Yoshida Tamm stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build honed from years of training and combat. Her raven-black hair falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail to keep it out of her face while she works. Her piercing emerald eyes seem to gleam with an inner light, as if shining with an intensity that can see right through deception.

Beyond these interests lies a deeper curiosity about the social dynamics of feudal Japan, often fueling her missions by examining the intricacies of power structures and class divisions. When not on a mission, Tamm can be found lost in thought, pondering the ethics of her actions or contemplating new ways to improve her skills.
