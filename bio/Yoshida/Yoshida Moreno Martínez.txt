Her hair is dark brown and styled in loose waves, often adorned with subtle silver accessories that reflect her affinity for luxury and sophistication. Her eyes are an striking shade of emerald green, a trait she inherited from her maternal grandfather.

**Personality:** Yoshida is known for her razor-sharp wit, quick tongue, and sharp intellect, earning her the nickname "La Diabla" (The Devil) among friends and colleagues. She exudes confidence, poise, and a sense of self-assurance that commands attention and respect in any room she enters. Her piercing green eyes seem to see right through people, making them uncomfortable with her unflinching candor. Beneath her polished exterior lies a sharp mind, a quick wit, and a dry sense of humor that can leave even the most seasoned adversaries reeling.

**Interests:** Yoshida's true passion lies in collecting antique taxidermy pieces, which she has been preserving and showcasing for years.
