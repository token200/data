**Additional Details:**
Dace is likely in her mid-to-late 30s, with a no-nonsense approach to life. She exudes confidence and a sense of authority, which can sometimes be intimidating to those who underestimate her. Her background as a freelance journalist has given her an extensive network of contacts and informants, making her a formidable investigator.

While Dace's primary drive is to expose corruption and truth, her love for storytelling hints at a more creative side to her personality. She may have a dry sense of humor and enjoy witty banter, often using humor as a tool to disarm those around her.

Dace's affinity for Krakow's hidden corners and residents suggests that she has developed a deep connection with the city and its people over time. This attachment may also be linked to her passion for storytelling, which seeks to preserve and celebrate the stories of others.

The mention of lilacs in the story implies that Dace has a soft spot for nature and beauty, perhaps hinting at a more sentimental side to her personality.
