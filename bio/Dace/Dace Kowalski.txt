Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dace Kowalski:

**Personality:** Dace is a complex individual with a troubled past. He exhibits signs of emotional detachment, which is likely a coping mechanism for his experiences as a member of the Shadowhand Clan. However, he also displays vulnerability and sensitivity, particularly when interacting with Jack, who seems to be one of the few people who can offer him genuine support and understanding.

Dace's sense of self-worth is tied to his past actions, which may contribute to his feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about his future. Despite this, he has taken a significant step towards redemption by leaving the Shadowhand Clan, demonstrating that he is capable of change and growth.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Other notable physical characteristics: Dace's features are not explicitly described in the provided story, but it can be inferred that he has a lean and possibly athletic build, given his ability to move quickly through crowded streets.

**Interests:** 

* Music: The melody of the Shadowhand Clan's anthem serves as a poignant reminder of Dace's past for him. This suggests that music may hold emotional significance for him.
* Alcohol: Dace orders whiskey on multiple occasions during the story, indicating that he enjoys drinking or at least finds it comforting in his current state.

While there is limited information about Dace's interests beyond these two examples, his feelings towards music and alcohol hint at a potentially more introspective and emotionally expressive side of his personality.
