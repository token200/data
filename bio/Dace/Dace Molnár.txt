**Physical Attributes:** Dace stands at an imposing height of around 6'2" (188 cm), with a lean yet muscular build that speaks to his background in special forces. His eyes are an piercing shade of blue, almost icy in intensity, which seems to bore into those he looks at. His hair is dark brown, often neatly trimmed to keep it out of his face.

**Personality:** Dace is a man shrouded in mystery, with a quiet confidence and unyielding sense of justice that makes him a formidable presence. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, which led him to leave the military and start anew in Ashwood.

**Interests:** Dace's interests seem to revolve around justice, protection, and defense. He is deeply invested in safeguarding the people of Ashwood and uncovering any wrongdoing or corruption that threatens their safety. His background as a special forces operative has honed his skills in combat and tactics, which he now uses to navigate the complexities of small-town life.

Beyond these interests, little is revealed about Dace's personal passions or hobbies. However, it's possible that his experiences in the military have given him a deep appreciation for discipline, loyalty, and camaraderie – traits that he may be looking to reestablish in his new life in Ashwood.

As an outsider, Dace seems to be driven by a sense of restlessness and a desire to prove himself. He is drawn to situations where he can make a difference, often taking on challenges without hesitation or fear. His determination is rooted in a strong moral compass, which guides him toward protecting those who cannot defend themselves.

Overall, Dace Molnár appears to be a complex individual with a rich inner life, driven by a deep sense of purpose and justice.
