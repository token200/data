Based on the provided story about Martina Navratilova, I've created a fictional character profile for Dace Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
Dace Navratilova stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with a lean and athletic build. Her eyes are an striking shade of bright blue, reminiscent of the Czech Republic's clear skies. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a ponytail or bobbed to accentuate her sharp jawline. She has a small tattoo of a tennis racket on her left shoulder blade.

**Personality:**
Dace is a fearless and confident individual who embodies the same unapologetic attitude that made Martina Navratilova a legend on the court. Dace is fiercely independent, always speaking her mind and standing up for what she believes in, even if it means challenging the status quo. She's charismatic and has an infectious laugh, making those around her feel at ease.

**Interests:**
Dace is passionate about tennis, of course! However, she's also a skilled photographer, capturing stunning images of the Czech Republic's landscapes and cityscapes. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to stay centered and focused. Dace is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. She's particularly drawn to stories about strong women who have made a difference in their communities.

While I created this character profile inspired by Martina Navratilova's story, please note that the original character, Martina, is a well-established tennis legend with her own distinct personality, physical attributes, and interests.
