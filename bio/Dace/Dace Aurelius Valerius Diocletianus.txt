Here is a summary of Dace Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dace Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus is a complex, intense individual with an unwavering passion for power and conquest. He is resolute in his determination to reclaim Rome's lost territories from the Marcomannic Horde, even if it means sacrificing his own soul. His conviction borders on fanaticism, driving him to push boundaries and test limits. This fire within him also fuels a sense of paranoia, making him increasingly reclusive and isolated from the world.

Despite this, Diocletianus is not entirely one-dimensional; he exhibits flashes of vulnerability when faced with those who challenge his authority or ignite a spark of recognition in his inner self. When interacting with Elara, the young priestess, he reveals hints of humanity beneath his imposing exterior.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** 6'4" (193 cm), an imposing figure that commands attention
- **Eye Color:** Piercing blue, almost grey-blue, reflecting a cold intensity that misses nothing

**Interests:** Diocletianus is deeply invested in:

1. **Power and Conquest**: The pursuit of power drives him to expand Rome's borders and reclaim lost territories.
2. **Military Campaigns**: He finds solace in strategic planning and execution of military campaigns, often obsessing over the finer details.
3. **Strategy and Tactics**: Diocletianus is a master strategist, always seeking innovative ways to outmaneuver his foes.

Despite his singular focus on conquest, there are hints that he may have interests outside of power itself. For instance, Elara's presence suggests a desire for human connection or spiritual fulfillment that the Emperor may not acknowledge. This ambiguity makes Diocletianus a more nuanced character, full of contradictions and hidden depths.
