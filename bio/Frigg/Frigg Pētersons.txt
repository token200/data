Here is a summary of the fictional character Frigg Pētersons:

**Physical Attributes:** Frigg stands at approximately 5'7" (170 cm) with a slender build. Her curly brown hair, which has lost some of its luster since moving to the city, frames her heart-shaped face. Her bright blue eyes, though slightly tired from late nights spent studying, sparkle with curiosity and enthusiasm.

**Personality:** Frigg is an inquisitive and driven individual with a passion for learning. She is fiercely independent and values knowledge as an end in itself, rather than just a means to achieve a goal. Despite her academic focus, she has a playful side, enjoying quiet moments with friends over plates of rye bread or sharing laughter-filled conversations about complex theories. Frigg's curiosity for the unknown is sparked by her childhood stories and fueled by her late-night discussions with Elvīna.

**Interests:** Frigg is deeply interested in mathematics, particularly quantum mechanics and chaos theory. She has a fascination with abstract concepts and enjoys exploring their connections to other fields. Her grandfather Jānis' tales of sea monsters and mythical creatures ignited a sense of wonder within her, and she continues to draw inspiration from these stories. In addition to academia, Frigg values meaningful relationships and enjoys sharing experiences with close friends like Elvīna.
