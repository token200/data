**Personality:** Frigg is a fiercely independent and determined individual with a sharp mind and quick wit. She has a strong sense of justice and is willing to take risks to uncover the truth, even if it means facing threats and backlash from powerful individuals. Her confidence and conviction make her a compelling and effective journalist, but also sometimes put her at odds with those in power.

**Physical Attributes:** Frigg stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build that allows her to navigate the crowded streets of Almaty with ease.

Her short, dark hair is often styled in a neat and professional manner, reflecting her commitment to her work.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Frigg's primary interest lies in uncovering the truth and shedding light on systemic corruption. However, outside of her professional life, she enjoys:

* Hiking in the nearby Tian Shan mountains, where she can escape the chaos of the city and connect with nature
* Reading classic Kazakh literature and poetry, which provides a sense of cultural heritage and connection to her roots
* Cooking traditional Kazakh dishes at home, using ingredients sourced from local markets and farmers' stalls

Frigg's love of adventure and willingness to take risks also make her an avid traveler, often venturing into unfamiliar territories in search of new stories and experiences.
