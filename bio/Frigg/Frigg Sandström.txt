Here is a summary of Frigg Sandström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Frigg is a fearless and adventurous individual with a strong sense of determination. She is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world around her and a desire to explore its secrets. Despite her bold nature, she also has a compassionate side, stemming from her upbringing in the small fishing village of Kälarne. This upbringing instilled in her a love for her native Sweden and its people, as well as a strong sense of duty and responsibility.

**Physical Attributes:** Frigg is a striking figure with long blonde hair that often appears wild and untamed. Her piercing blue eyes are a distinctive feature, seeming to gleam with an inner light even on the stormiest of days. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, a height that belies her athletic build and rugged outdoor lifestyle.

**Interests:** Frigg's primary interests lie in exploration, navigation, and the ocean. As a skilled sailor and explorer, she has spent countless hours charting courses through treacherous waters and discovering hidden coves and secret islands. Her passion for the sea is rivaled only by her love of adventure and discovery. Additionally, she has a deep connection to her native Sweden and its people, which drives her sense of duty and responsibility.

It's worth noting that some details about Frigg's physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the original story (e.g., her eye color was described as "piercing blue", but not the exact shade), so I've taken some creative liberties to flesh out her character.
