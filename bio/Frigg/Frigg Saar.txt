Here is a summary of the fictional character Frigg Saar's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Frigg Saar appears to be a creative and introspective individual with a deep appreciation for tradition and innovation. She has a calm and peaceful demeanor, as evident from her visit to the Happo-en Garden, where she feels "a sense of peace wash over [her]". This suggests that she values serenity and mental clarity in her life. As a freelance graphic designer, Frigg may be an independent and self-motivated person who is not afraid to take risks and explore new ideas.

**Physical Attributes:** Frigg Saar's physical attributes are not extensively described in the story, but we can make some educated guesses based on her profession and interests. She likely has a slender build and stands at around 5'6" (168 cm) with a subtle elegance that allows her to blend into the surroundings of Tokyo's Shinjuku district.

Her eye color is described as not being explicitly mentioned in the story, so we can assume it's a neutral shade such as brown or gray. Her hair is likely long and straight, possibly with subtle Japanese-inspired designs or styles, reflecting her appreciation for traditional culture.

**Interests:** Frigg Saar has two main areas of interest: graphic design and traditional Japanese tea ceremonies (Chanoyu). As a freelance designer, she is drawn to creating stunning visuals that captivate audiences worldwide. Her profession allows her to express her creativity and experiment with innovative techniques, but it's clear that there's more to her artistic expression than meets the eye.

Her interest in Chanoyu stems from its spiritual and cultural significance, which resonates deeply with Frigg's own creative spirit. She finds meaning in the ancient traditions surrounding tea ceremonies and is eager to incorporate these elements into her graphic design work, creating pieces that blend tradition and innovation.

With her newfound understanding of traditional Japanese culture, Frigg Saar feels inspired to explore new ideas and push the boundaries of her art, fostering a fusion of old and new that reflects her unique perspective on the world.
