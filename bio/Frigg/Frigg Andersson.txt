Here's a summary of Frigg Andersson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Frigg stands at 5'8" with an athletic build, honed from years of exploring the harsh Swedish wilderness. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up under a worn woolen hat to protect it from the elements. Her eyes are a piercing blue, a trait she inherited from her father, and seem to hold a depth of understanding that belies her youthful appearance. A smattering of freckles across her cheeks adds to her rugged charm.

**Personality:**
Frigg is a resilient and resourceful young woman who has grown up in one of the most remote corners of Sweden. She's fiercely independent, having learned to rely on herself from a young age after witnessing the struggles of her family in the harsh, unforgiving landscape. Her determination and courage in the face of uncertainty are traits she's developed over time, honed by countless hours spent exploring the wilderness and facing its challenges head-on.

**Interests:**
Frigg is passionate about the natural world and has a deep respect for the power and mystery that lies beneath it. She's an expert tracker and knows every inch of the frozen landscapes around her village, having spent countless hours honing her skills as a hunter. Her love of nature is not just practical but also spiritual, with a sense that there's something more to this world than meets the eye.

As someone who has grown up with stories of eerie occurrences on the lake and whispers carried on the wind, Frigg has always felt drawn to the unexplained and the unknown. She's curious about the secrets that lie beneath the surface of this frozen world, and her encounter with Jonas only deepens her resolve to uncover them.

Frigg is also fiercely loyal to her family and community, having grown up in a close-knit village where everyone knows each other's stories. Her sense of duty and responsibility to those she cares about drives much of her actions, and she'll stop at nothing to protect them from harm.
