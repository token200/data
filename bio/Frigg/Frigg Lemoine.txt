Here is a summary of the fictional character Frigg Lemoine:

**Physical Attributes:** Frigg is likely in her mid-to-late 30s, with a slender yet athletic build that speaks to her profession as a private investigator. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an unkempt mane of dark brown hair and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. Her features are sharp and angular, giving her an otherworldly appearance.

**Personality:** Frigg is a master manipulator, as aptly described by her reputation as "The Spider." She has an uncanny ability to read people, often leaving them sensing that they're being watched or manipulated. Despite this, she's not inherently cruel or malicious – rather, she's driven by curiosity and a need to unravel the complex web of secrets and lies that surrounds her cases.

Frigg is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to operate outside the boundaries of conventional morality and authority. This independence can sometimes make it difficult for others to trust her, but those who know her well understand that she's driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth, no matter how dark or disturbing.

**Interests:** Frigg is deeply interested in the darker corners of human nature and the secrets that people keep hidden. She has a fascination with the mysteries of the past and the way that history can inform our understanding of the present.

As a private investigator, Frigg's interests lie in tracking down clues, interviewing suspects, and piecing together seemingly unrelated facts to form a larger picture. Her expertise is in reading people, recognizing patterns and behaviors, and using this insight to guide her investigations.

Beyond her professional pursuits, Frigg has a personal interest in exploring the gray areas of morality and the ethics of operating outside the law. She's not afraid to push boundaries or challenge authority when she believes that justice requires it.

Despite her tough exterior, Frigg has a vulnerable side – one that she only reveals to those closest to her. Her own demons and personal history drive much of her motivation, fueling her quest for truth and justice in the darkest corners of society.
