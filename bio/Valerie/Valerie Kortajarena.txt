Based on the inspiration from María Kortajarena, an Argentine actress and model, I will create a fictional character profile for Valerie Kortajarena. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Valerie Kortajarena is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with striking features. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, while her eyes are an expressive shade of hazel that seems to change with every mood. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors on the Argentine coast.

**Personality:**
Valerie is a vibrant and charismatic individual who exudes confidence and self-assurance. She is fiercely independent, always willing to take risks and challenge conventions. Despite her bold exterior, she has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards those around her. Valerie's passion for life is contagious, and she inspires others with her infectious energy and warmth.

**Interests:**
Valerie has a deep love for the arts, music, and literature. She is an avid reader of Argentine poetry and fiction, and her favorite authors include Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. When not indulging in books, Valerie can be found practicing yoga or playing the guitar to express herself creatively.

I hope this character profile meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further requests or need additional assistance.
