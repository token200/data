I'd be happy to help create a fictional character based on your request. Since there's no real person named Finn Saldana, I'll choose David Tennant as the inspiration.

Here's a summary of Finn Saldana's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair: Dark brown with hints of auburn
* Build: Lean and athletic

**Personality:**

Finn Saldana is a charismatic and confident individual. He's a natural-born leader, always taking charge and inspiring those around him to follow his lead. Despite his bold nature, he has a compassionate side and is fiercely loyal to his friends and loved ones.

As an actor, Finn brings a sense of vulnerability and depth to his roles, making him relatable and endearing to audiences. He's also known for his quick wit and dry humor, often catching those around him off guard with a well-timed joke or sarcastic comment.

**Interests:**

When not acting, Finn enjoys playing music (he's an avid guitarist and singer-songwriter). He's passionate about environmental causes and is involved in several charitable organizations that focus on sustainable living and conservation. In his free time, he loves to travel and explore new cultures, often incorporating historical facts and anecdotes into his conversations.

I hope this summary fits your request! Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes or if you have any other questions.
