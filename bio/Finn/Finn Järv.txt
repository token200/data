Here is a summary of Finn Järv's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Finn Järv stands at approximately 6 feet (183 cm) tall with an athletic build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, exuding an air of quiet confidence that commands attention. His chiseled features and sharp jawline give him a strong, handsome appearance.

**Personality:** Finn is a creative and introspective individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He has a deep emotional depth and is unafraid to express himself through music. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, preferring to connect with his fans on a personal level rather than seeking to maintain an air of celebrity.

**Interests:** Finn's primary interest is music, which has been his passion since childhood. He is an accomplished guitarist and songwriter who pours his emotions into every note. In addition to music, Finn values independence and self-expression, often feeling like an outsider among the more affluent members of his family. This sense of restlessness drives him to explore his own path in life and stay true to himself.

It's worth noting that there are no details about Finn's weight or hair color provided in the original text, so I had to make assumptions based on common characteristics associated with individuals who are often portrayed as handsome and charismatic.
