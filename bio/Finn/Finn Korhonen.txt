Here is a summary of the fictional character Finn Korhonen:

Physical Attributes: Finn stands at 6'2" with an athletic yet rugged build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in loose strands. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost grey, which seems to hold a perpetual wisdom. He has a thick beard that frames his face, adding to his outdoorsy appearance.

Personality: Finn is a complex individual with multiple layers. On the surface, he appears tough and rugged, often donning flannel shirts and jeans, but beneath this exterior lies a sensitive soul who is deeply passionate about poetry and old books. He has a strong sense of justice and is fiercely protective of the natural world, which is reflected in his work as a park ranger.

Interests: Finn's love for nature runs deep, and he finds solace in the wilderness, particularly during his nighttime writing sessions by the campfire. His favorite authors include ancient Finnish poets like Elias LÃ¶nnrot, who inspired him to explore his own creative side through poetry. He is also an avid reader of history books, which helps him understand the land's rich cultural heritage.

Background: Finn grew up in a small town on the edge of Lake Superior, surrounded by the natural beauty that would shape his life and interests. His Finnish parents instilled in him a deep appreciation for the land, its people, and their ancestors' struggles. The loss of his younger sister serves as a reminder of his vulnerabilities, but also sparks his desire to find connection with others and heal through shared experiences.

As he embarks on this new journey with Lily, Finn finds himself re-evaluating his life, confronting his insecurities, and opening up to the possibility of finding love and healing.
