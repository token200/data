**Personality:** Finn is a driven and ambitious individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and has a keen mind that allows him to analyze complex information quickly.

However, his intense focus on his work can sometimes make him come across as introverted or aloof to those who don't know him.

**Physical Attributes:** Finn stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he interviews. His dark brown hair is often mussed and unkempt, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that belies his sharp intellect. He has a lean build from years of neglecting his physical health in favor of long hours spent researching and writing.

**Interests:** Finn is passionate about uncovering the truth and exposing corruption, particularly in government and corporate circles. In his free time, he enjoys reading books on history, economics, and politics, which fuel his interest in investigative journalism.

Despite his dedication to his work, Finn is not above having fun and enjoying social events when he can. However, these opportunities are few and far between, as his focus on his investigation usually takes priority. His colleagues appreciate his tireless work ethic and praise him for his commitment to truth-telling, even if it means putting in long hours away from the spotlight.
