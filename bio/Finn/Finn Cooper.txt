Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Finn Cooper:

**Name:** Finn Cooper

**Age:** 17 years old (as mentioned in the story)

**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm) - A slender yet athletic build, allowing her to navigate the rugged terrain of the Amazon rainforest with ease.

**Eye Color:** Hazel - A bright, sparkling brown that seems to shine with excitement whenever Finn is exploring or adventuring.

**Personality:** Determined, adventurous, and passionate about nature. Finn has an unquenchable thirst for exploration and a heart full of determination, which drives her to push beyond her limits and explore the unknown. She's also fiercely independent and values her friendships above all else, as evident from her close bond with Alex.

**Interests:** Wildlife conservation, exploration, photography (as seen in the story where she captures a photo of the capuchin monkeys), video games (shared passion with Alex).

The profile creates a vivid image of Finn Cooper as a young, spirited, and adventurous individual who embodies the qualities of determination, friendship, and love for nature.
