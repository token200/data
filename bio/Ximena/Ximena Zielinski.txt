Ximena Zielinski stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that often falls in loose waves down her back, and her eyes are a striking shade of emerald green. Her features are sharp and expressive, with high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile.

**Personality:**
Ximena Zielinski is a force to be reckoned with - confident, passionate, and unapologetic about her artistic vision. She is fiercely individualistic and refuses to compromise on her creative values, which can sometimes make her come across as intense or confrontational to those who don't understand her process. Despite this, she has a soft spot for young artists and is willing to share her expertise and insights with those who are hungry to learn.

**Interests:**
Ximena's interests revolve around art, philosophy, and creativity in all its forms. She is an avid reader of modernist literature and contemporary philosophy, which informs much of her artistic practice. In her free time, she enjoys exploring the city, attending concerts, and experimenting with new techniques in the studio. Ximena is also a passionate advocate for social justice and uses her platform to amplify marginalized voices and promote diversity in the art world.

**Creative Practice:**
As a painter and sculptor, Ximena Zielinski is known for her bold, vibrant works that explore themes of energy, movement, and transformation. Her studio is a hub of creative activity, with canvases in various stages of completion and materials scattered everywhere. She is constantly experimenting with new techniques, mediums, and ideas, which can sometimes result in unexpected breakthroughs or discoveries.

**Quirks:**
Ximena has a few quirks that are evident to those who know her well. She has a habit of talking to herself when she's working on a piece - often using phrases like "yes, yes, yes" or "no, no, no" as she navigates the creative process. She is also a bit of a neat freak, despite the chaos that seems to pervade her studio. Ximena has a weakness for old books and vinyl records, which can sometimes distract her from the task at hand (although she would never admit it).
