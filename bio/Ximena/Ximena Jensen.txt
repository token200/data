Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Ximena Jensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ximena is a driven and ambitious individual who has always prioritized success in her career. However, beneath this surface-level persona, she is restless and yearning for something more. She is fiercely independent and values her alone time, but at the same time, she craves human connection and meaning. As the story progresses, Ximena reveals a vulnerable side, embracing uncertainty and allowing herself to be guided by intuition.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue-green (a unique blend of gray and green hues that reflect her introspective nature)

**Interests:** Ximena is an art lover who has always been fascinated by creative expression. She begins taking art classes at night, experimenting with paints and canvases she had long forgotten existed. Her interests also include philosophy, music, and exploring the city's culture.

In addition to these attributes, it can be inferred that Ximena has a passion for:

* Traveling (as hinted by her familiarity with Copenhagen)
* Personal growth and self-discovery
* Building meaningful relationships with others

Ximena's mysterious connection with the enigmatic woman who sent her the note "Start again" also suggests that she is drawn to unconventional experiences and may have an interest in spirituality, mysticism, or alternative ways of living.
