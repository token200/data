Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Meng Marrone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Meng appears to be a complex and guarded individual. She has a troubled past, having been involved in situations that have caused harm to others, including her friend Ana. Despite this, she seems to have a strong sense of determination and resilience. When faced with new information about her past, she is cautious but open to the possibility of change. Her demeanor suggests that she may be fiercely independent and self-reliant, as evidenced by her instinctive reach for her pocket knife when meeting the young woman.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: Meng's height is not explicitly stated in the story, so I will make an assumption for the purpose of this summary - she is likely around 5'8" (173 cm), which is slightly above average height.
- Eye Color: The text does not provide a specific eye color for Meng, but based on the description of her gaze in relation to the young woman's green eyes, I will assume that hers are perhaps darker and more intense - such as dark brown or almost black.

**Interests:** Given the events of the story, it can be inferred that Meng has a strong interest in uncovering her past and understanding her connection to Ana. The map provided by the mysterious young woman seems to represent an opportunity for Meng to explore her own history, rather than simply continuing on a cycle of chaos. This might suggest that she is someone who values knowledge, self-discovery, and taking control of her life.

It's also worth noting that Meng appears to be drawn to the unknown or unexplained aspects of life, as evidenced by her wariness when faced with unexpected interactions (like the young woman approaching her) and her determination to explore her past. This curiosity might drive her further along the path she is now embarked on.
