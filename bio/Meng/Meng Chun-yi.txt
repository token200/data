He has spent years honing his craft in the seedy underbelly of Shanghai's nightlife, where he has built a reputation for being able to steal anything, no matter how secure. Despite his success, he is a calculating individual who assesses situations carefully before acting. However, when faced with an opponent like Ling, he begins to show a more nuanced side, revealing a respect and admiration for her intelligence and determination.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green

**Interests:** The Fox has an insatiable curiosity about the world around him, particularly when it comes to art, luxury, and innovation. He is fascinated by the rarest and most valuable items, which drives his career as a thief. In addition to his love of high-stakes heists, he also has a passion for observing human behavior, studying people's habits and motivations to stay one step ahead of his marks.

As The Fox begins to see the world in a different light after his encounter with Ling, he becomes more interested in the art of detection and problem-solving. He starts to view himself not just as a thief, but as a student of human psychology and behavior.
