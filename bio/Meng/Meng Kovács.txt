Based on the short story provided, I will create a fictional character profile for Meng Kovács:

**Name:** Meng Kovács

**Age:** Late 30s (estimated)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often unkempt and worn long
* Face Shape: Oval with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of intense study and research

**Personality:**

Meng is an intensely driven individual, consumed by his passion for understanding the mysteries of the universe. He is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. Despite this, he has a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to connect with others on a intellectual level.

As someone who has spent years pouring over data and conducting research, Meng has developed a dry wit and sarcasm that serves as a defense mechanism against the skepticism and criticism he often faces in his field. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a kindred spirit who is genuinely committed to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos.

**Interests:**

* Astrophysics
* Black hole behavior
* Fast radio bursts (FRBs)
* Theoretical physics
* Reading scientific literature and philosophy
* Long walks under the stars

Meng's fascination with FRBs has become an all-consuming force in his life, driving him to dedicate countless hours to understanding this phenomenon. He is known to spend entire days poring over data and scribbling notes by hand, fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge.

Outside of academia, Meng is relatively introverted and prefers the quiet solitude of the night sky to social gatherings or large crowds. When he does venture out, it's often to clear his head or reflect on his research, rather than engage in small talk or socializing.

Overall, Meng Kovács is a complex and enigmatic individual, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe and its secrets.
