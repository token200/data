Meng has a lean, athletic build honed from years of piloting his ship through treacherous asteroid fields and hostile alien territories.

**Interests:** Meng's primary interest is navigating the galaxy and evading detection as a space smuggler. He's skilled at using his knowledge of machinery and technology to repair and upgrade his ship, the "Moonlit Serenade."
