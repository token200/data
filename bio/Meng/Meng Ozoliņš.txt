Based on the fictional story about Meng Olsen, I've created a character profile for Meng Ozoliņš. Please note that this is an entirely new character with no relation to the original story.

**Name:** Meng Ozoliņš
**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s
**Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)
**Eye Color:** Piercing blue, reminiscent of a clear Baltic Sea

**Personality:** Meng Ozoliņš is a charismatic and confident individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging traditional norms and expectations. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect the vulnerable.

Meng is a natural leader, inspiring loyalty and devotion from those around him. His quick wit and sharp intellect make him an effective strategist, able to think on his feet and outmaneuver his opponents. He is fiercely competitive, but his motivations are driven by a desire to do what's right rather than personal gain.

**Interests:** Meng Ozoliņš has a deep passion for philosophy, particularly Eastern thought and mysticism. He is an avid reader of ancient texts and loves to explore the intersection of spirituality and martial arts. When he's not training or fighting, he enjoys practicing calligraphy and playing the traditional Baltic folk instrument, the lute.

Meng also has a secret love for baking, which may seem like an unusual interest for someone of his stature. However, he finds solace in creating intricate pastries and cakes that bring joy to those around him. His baked goods are legendary among his friends and allies, who often seek out his creations after a long battle or hard day.

Overall, Meng Ozoliņš is a complex and dynamic individual with a rich inner life and a passion for justice, wisdom, and baking.
