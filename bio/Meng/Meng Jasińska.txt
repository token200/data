Since I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Meng Jasińska, I will create a new character based on the inspiration provided by Mei Meng's story.

Name: Maya Željić

Physical Attributes:
Maya is of Eastern European descent, with long, dark brown hair and piercing blue-green eyes. She stands at 5'8" (172 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone due to her love of spending time outdoors.

Personality:
Maya is a creative and determined individual who embodies the same passion for art that Mei Meng exhibits. She is fiercely independent and values self-expression above all else. Maya's strong sense of justice drives her to use her talents to raise awareness about social and environmental causes she cares deeply about.

Interests:
Maya is an avid artist, calligrapher, and nature lover. She finds solace in the intricate patterns of leaves and branches, which inspire many of her works. Maya is also a talented writer and poet, often using her words to express the beauty and complexity of the world around her. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga, hiking, and exploring local art communities.

Background:
Maya grew up in a family of artists and musicians, where creativity was highly valued. Her parents encouraged her to explore her passions, leading to a lifelong love affair with calligraphy, writing, and the natural world. Maya's unique style is influenced by her Eastern European heritage and her fascination with ancient art forms.

As Maya navigates her career as an artist and advocate, she finds herself drawn to projects that combine her love of nature, art, and social justice. Whether creating public installations or collaborating with local organizations, Maya Željić is a force to be reckoned with – passionate, creative, and dedicated to making a positive impact on the world around her.
