Based on the initial prompt, I will choose option 3: Write about an existing character. Since there is no information available on Meng Majewski, I will use this opportunity to create a new character.

Here's a summary of Meng Majewski:

**Physical Attributes:** Meng Majewski is of East Asian descent with dark brown hair and piercing emerald green eyes. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, which is slightly above average height for her ethnicity. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone due to frequent exposure to the sun.

**Personality:** Meng Majewski is a free-spirited individual who embodies a mix of adventure and determination. She is fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. Despite this, she has a compassionate side that often surfaces in times of crisis or when dealing with those in need. Her quick wit and sharp intellect make her a formidable opponent in any intellectual debate.

**Interests:** Meng Majewski is an avid explorer who loves discovering hidden gems and uncovering secrets lost to time. She is passionate about archaeology, history, and anthropology, often going to great lengths to study the cultures and civilizations of bygone eras. In her free time, she enjoys practicing martial arts, reading classical literature, and traveling to remote locations in search of new experiences.
