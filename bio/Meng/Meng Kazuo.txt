Here's a summary of Meng Kazuo's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Meng Kazuo is portrayed as a skilled, intelligent, and resourceful individual with a strong sense of determination. She has built a reputation as one of the most elusive thieves in Taipei due to her sharp mind and quick reflexes. Her past experiences have made her street-smart, and she has developed a tough exterior that helps her navigate the challenges of her line of work.

However, Meng Kazuo also seems to harbor a troubled past, suggesting that there may be underlying vulnerabilities or emotional scars that drive her actions. Her desire for independence and autonomy is evident in her determination to keep her abilities secret from everyone except Phoenix, indicating a strong sense of self-preservation and control.

**Physical Attributes:** The physical attributes mentioned are:

- Height: Not specified
- Eye Color: Not explicitly stated, but based on the Asian context, it could be brown or possibly other shades commonly found in East Asia.

The story does not provide much detail about her height, as it is more focused on her skills and movements rather than descriptive physical appearance. However, assuming she's a typical Taiwanese woman, one might expect an average height of 5'2" to 5'4" (1.57 m - 1.63 m), but this is speculative.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Meng Kazuo has a strong interest in:

- Thievery and the art of stealing: This is her primary occupation, and she seems to take great pride in her skills and expertise.
- Outsmarting opponents: The museum's security systems are no match for her cunning and patience, indicating a deep understanding of tactics and strategy.
- Personal freedom and autonomy: As mentioned earlier, Meng Kazuo is determined to keep her abilities secret from everyone except Phoenix, suggesting she values independence and control over her life.

It can be inferred that these interests likely stem from her troubled past, where survival on the streets required adaptability and cunning.
