Based on the story provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Meng Jankowski:

**Name:** Meng Jankowski (First Name: Alexandra)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (172 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Body Type: Slender and Athletic, with a quiet confidence that belies her sharp intellect

**Personality:** Meng is an intensely curious and driven individual, with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of determination, which motivates her to push beyond the boundaries of what is thought possible. Despite her many accomplishments, she remains humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. Meng's passion for discovery often leads her to be seen as a perfectionist by others, but this drive only fuels her creative problem-solving skills.

**Interests:** Meng's main interests lie in astrophysics and cosmology, where she is currently working on several groundbreaking projects that aim to unlock the secrets of black holes. She enjoys stargazing, reading scientific papers, and engaging in philosophical debates with her colleagues. In her free time, Meng also appreciates long walks, listening to classical music, and practicing yoga to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

**Additional Details:** Meng's Polish heritage is evident in her surname "Jankowski," which she proudly wears as a symbol of her cultural roots. She often incorporates traditional folk dances into her celebrations, much to the surprise of her colleagues, who are more accustomed to modern Western culture.
