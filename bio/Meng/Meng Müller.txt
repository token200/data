Here is a summary of Meng Müller's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Meng Müller is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He has an air of calm authority that commands attention without demanding it. Despite being a master of his craft, he prefers to keep a low profile, which suggests that he may be introverted or private. However, when he performs on stage, he loses himself in the music and allows his true talent to shine through.

**Physical Attributes:** Meng is tall, with an unspecified height (let's assume 6'2" as a reasonable estimate). His eye color is not specified, but given the description of the woman's piercing green eyes, it's possible that Meng has bright blue or grey eyes. His hair is not mentioned, but it's likely that he has dark brown or black hair, which is common for people of East Asian descent (given his name and cultural background).

**Interests:** As a virtuoso violinist, Meng's primary interest is music, particularly classical music from the Baroque and Classical periods. He spends most of his time practicing and perfecting his craft, as well as studying the works of great composers like Bach, Mozart, and Chopin.

In addition to music, Meng seems to be interested in history and culture, as hinted at by the dusty tomes on music theory and faded concert posters from long-forgotten performances. He may also appreciate avant-garde art and experimental music, given his acceptance of the unknown composition that was rediscovered for him.

Overall, Meng Müller appears to be a creative, introspective person with a deep passion for music and a desire to explore new sounds and styles.
