**Personality:** Mason Kovacs is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past that has shaped him into a strong yet vulnerable person. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or guarded to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a deep well of emotions and a strong desire for connection and healing. Mason is fiercely independent and has a tendency to self-sabotage, but with the guidance of Ruby, he begins to confront his demons and develop emotional resilience.

**Physical Attributes:** Mason Kovacs stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing blue eyes are often described as intense and expressive, with a hint of sadness that suggests a deep well of inner pain. His dark hair is often unkempt or worn in a messy style, framing his chiseled features and sharp jawline.

**Interests:** Mason's interests lie at the intersection of art, history, and psychology. As an antique restorer, he has developed a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the craftsmanship and stories behind old objects. He is also fascinated by the human psyche and enjoys learning about various philosophical and spiritual traditions. On his days off, Mason can be found wandering through museums or art galleries, taking photographs, or practicing yoga to find inner balance.

With Ruby's guidance, Mason has discovered a newfound passion for antique restoration and has become an expert in his field. His interests now also include sharing his knowledge with others and helping people heal from their own troubled pasts, just as Ruby helped him heal his own wounds.
