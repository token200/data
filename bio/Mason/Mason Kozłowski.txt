Here's a summary of Mason Koz≈Çowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Mason is a ruggedly handsome man with a commanding presence. He stands at around 6'2" tall, which adds to his intimidating stature. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or vulnerabilities. His dark hair is often mussed, giving him a rough-around-the-edges appearance that belies the complexity of his character.

**Personality:** Mason is a complex and guarded individual with a deep sense of loyalty and justice. His years of service in the military have left emotional scars, but they also fuel his determination to protect those who can't defend themselves. Despite his tough exterior, he has a heart of gold and a strong moral compass that guides him in his work as a private investigator.

**Interests:** Mason's primary interest is in justice and protecting vulnerable individuals. His work as a private investigator allows him to use his skills to help those in need, while also seeking revenge against the syndicate responsible for the disappearance of Sophia's brother. Outside of work, Mason likely enjoys activities that allow him to clear his mind and relax, such as reading or listening to music.

It's worth noting that Mason's backstory suggests he may have a deep emotional scar from the loss of his wife in combat, but this has driven him to channel his grief into his work as a private investigator.
