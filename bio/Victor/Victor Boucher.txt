Here's a summary of Victor Boucher's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Victor Boucher stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of combat training and mercenary work. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he encounters, giving off an air of intensity and authority. His dark brown hair is often slicked back, revealing a prominent jawline and sharp facial features that speak to his rugged past. He has a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rough-around-the-edges charm.

**Personality:**
Victor Boucher is a confident and calculating individual with a keen sense of strategy and tactics. He's a natural-born leader, with an unwavering commitment to justice and a reputation for getting the job done no matter the cost. His years as a mercenary have left emotional scars, but they've also honed his instincts and fostered a deep-seated need for respect and control. Victor is fiercely independent, preferring to work alone rather than as part of a team, which can make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

**Interests:**
Outside of his bounty hunting work, Victor Boucher has a fascination with the underworld, often studying the tactics and strategies employed by the city's most notorious crime lords. He's particularly interested in psychology, analyzing the motivations and behaviors of his prey to better understand their thought processes. Victor also has a taste for fine whiskey and enjoys sipping on it after a long hunt or successful capture. When he's not tracking down fugitives, he can often be found reading about history, philosophy, or the latest trends in forensic science.

It's worth noting that while Victor Boucher is confident and self-assured, there are hints of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior. He may struggle with the moral implications of his work, and occasionally question whether the ends justify the means. Despite this, he remains committed to his code of honor and will stop at nothing to bring justice to those who have evaded capture for too long.
