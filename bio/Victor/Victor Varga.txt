He has spent years perfecting his craft and has earned a feared and respected name as Nightshade. However, beneath his tough exterior, Varga seems to be driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire for connection. Despite his rough past, he shows a hint of vulnerability when interacting with Sophia, suggesting that there may be more to him than meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Victor Varga is described as being dressed in a tailored black tuxedo, which suggests that he values fashion and style. He stands at an unmentioned height but appears confident and commanding in his appearance. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a deep intensity, giving away his mysterious nature.
