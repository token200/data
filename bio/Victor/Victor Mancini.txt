However, deep down, he still holds onto a glimmer of hope for redemption, suggesting that he is not entirely lost to his darker impulses.

**Physical Attributes:** Victor Mancini stands at 6'2" with an athletic build, likely honed through years of intense physical training as a hitman. His eye color is a piercing blue, which may have become even more intense due to the stress and trauma he has endured. His facial features are sharp and chiseled, suggesting a strong jawline and piercing gaze that commands respect.

**Interests:** As a former surgeon, Victor Mancini's interests lie in precision and efficiency. He is drawn to the art of surgical manipulation and may have brought this skillset over into his work as a hitman.

Outside of his professional life, Victor's interests are largely unknown, but it is likely that he has few personal connections or hobbies due to his isolated lifestyle.
