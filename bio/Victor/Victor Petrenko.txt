His piercing blue eyes are a hallmark of his charismatic presence, able to charm even the most skeptical of individuals.

**Personality:** Victor is a master manipulator with a quick wit and silver tongue. He exudes confidence and charisma, effortlessly weaving a web of deceit that can deceive even the most astute observers. Despite his polished exterior, however, he has a vulnerable side that few people have glimpsed beneath the surface. He struggles with loneliness and emotional connection, often using his charm as a shield to keep others at bay.
