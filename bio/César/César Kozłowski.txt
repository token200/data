Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character César Kozłowski:

**Personality:**
César is a brilliant and reclusive physicist who is intensely focused on solving the mysterious phenomenon known as "The Echo Effect." He is driven, passionate, and utterly obsessed with his work, often to the point of neglecting other aspects of his life. Despite his intensity, César has a sense of humor and can appreciate a good joke or teasing from his trusty sidekick, Rachel. However, he also appears to be somewhat isolated and uncomfortable with social interactions, preferring the company of his thoughts and equations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Wild grey
* Hair Style: Disheveled and sticking out in every direction

César's wild grey hair gives him a perpetually disheveled appearance that belies his sharp mind. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential contributions to his research.

**Interests:**
César is intensely interested in solving the mystery of "The Echo Effect," a phenomenon that has been plaguing him for months. He spends most of his time studying equations, building devices, and experimenting with different variables in an attempt to understand why certain particles repeat themselves in a seemingly random pattern.

He is also deeply invested in his work, often becoming completely absorbed in his research to the point where he neglects other aspects of his life. Despite this, César's trusty sidekick, Rachel, has come to recognize and appreciate his unique strengths and abilities, and together they form a formidable team determined to unlock the secrets of The Echo Effect.

It is worth noting that César's interests are centered around scientific inquiry and discovery, particularly in the field of physics. His reclusive nature and intense focus on his work suggest that he may be someone who is most at home when surrounded by equations, data, and theoretical models, rather than in social situations or other environments.
