Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of César Sten:

**Personality:** César is a complex individual with a rugged exterior. As a retired hitman, he has seen and done things that would be traumatic for most people, leaving him with emotional scars and a toughened worldview. Despite this, he still has a dry sense of humor and a wry wit, as evident in his banter with the bartender. He is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, unwilling to play by others' rules or take orders from anyone. This independence stems from years of doing things his own way, even if it meant going against authority or risking his own life.

**Physical Attributes:** César is a man in his late 50s, with a worn and weathered appearance that reflects his years of dealing with the darker side of human nature. He stands at around 6 feet tall, with a lean yet imposing build that commands respect. His hair has thinned significantly, but he still maintains a distinctive shock of gray hair at the crown, adding to his rugged allure. His eyes are a deep brown, almost like coal, and they seem to hold a world of experience and wisdom within them.

**Interests:** As a retired hitman, César's interests revolve around the darker aspects of human nature. He is drawn to people with troubled pasts or those who operate on the fringes of society. He has an affinity for whiskey and a fondness for watching sports, particularly boxing matches, which he finds both cathartic and thrilling. Above all, however, César is driven by his curiosity about people and their motivations. He loves to observe human behavior, study people's reactions, and analyze the underlying dynamics of any situation.

Despite his rough exterior, César has a deep sense of loyalty and honor, which he developed over years of working as a hitman. He takes on jobs that align with his own moral code, even if it means going against the interests of those who pay him. For him, there's no greater thrill than taking on a job that tests his skills and pushes him to his limits.

It's worth noting that César is not someone to be underestimated. Beneath his gruff exterior lies a sophisticated and calculating mind, honed over years of dealing with high-stakes situations and ruthless adversaries.
