In his downtime, Vivaan enjoys sipping whiskey at underground bars in Rio, indulging in the sounds of sultry jazz music, and reading up on everything from art history to cryptography. His interests also extend to cryptic puzzles and codes, which he occasionally uses to test his own skills or solve problems outside of his line of work.

It is clear that Vivaan Luis Borges is a man of many talents, driven by an insatiable curiosity and desire for excitement.
