Here is a summary of Vivaan Salemi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Vivaan Salemi stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing brown eyes are his most distinctive feature, framed by dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy fashion. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Vivaan is a driven and ambitious individual with a quick wit and sharp instincts. As a journalist, he is fiercely curious and determined to uncover the truth behind every story. Despite his tough exterior, Vivaan has a compassionate side and is drawn to people who have been misunderstood or overlooked by society. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to get to the heart of the matter.

**Interests:**
Vivaan's interests lie at the intersection of art, culture, and social justice. As a journalist, he is passionate about shedding light on the stories that need to be told, from the marginalized voices of Mumbai's underbelly to the hidden histories of its ancient cities. He has a deep love for music, particularly Indian classical, and is an avid fan of contemporary art movements. When not chasing leads or conducting interviews, Vivaan can often be found sipping chai at a local cafe or exploring the city's streets in search of new experiences.

Despite his rough-around-the-edges exterior, Vivaan has a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes. His encounter with The Phoenix sets him on a path of self-discovery, forcing him to confront his own biases and assumptions about identity, art, and the human condition.
