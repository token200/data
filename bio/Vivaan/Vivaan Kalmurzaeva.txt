Based on the short story, here is a summary of Vivaan Kalmurzaeva's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Vivaan is an enigmatic figure with a complex and multifaceted personality. On stage, she exudes raw energy and vulnerability, drawing listeners in with her mesmerizing voice. However, off-stage, she appears guarded and detached, like a ghostly figure whose past and motivations are lost to the shadows. She seems to know exactly how to push people's buttons, making them crave more, and has a deep understanding of human psychology that allows her to manipulate those around her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she performs for
* Hair: Dark brown, often styled in a sleek and edgy manner

**Interests:** Vivaan is deeply passionate about music and the art of performance. She seems to have an innate connection to the urban music scene and has built a reputation as one of its most captivating performers. Her interests also extend to exploring the darker corners of human nature, which she seems to tap into through her music.

While Kaida's description suggests that Vivaan's true persona is not so different from her stage presence, some details about her personality remain shrouded in mystery, leaving it unclear what lies beneath the surface. Despite this, one thing is certain: The Siren is a force to be reckoned with, both on and off-stage.
