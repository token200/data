Here is a summary of Nathalie Volkov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Nathalie stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build, likely developed from her years as a ballerina. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a neat bob that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are piercing green, with a sharp, intelligent glint that misses nothing.

**Personality:** Nathalie is a complex and introspective person, shaped by her tumultuous past and her struggles to find meaning and purpose. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which served her well during her dance career. However, this independence also led to a deep-seated fear of vulnerability and intimacy, making it difficult for her to open up to others. Despite this, Nathalie has a compassionate and empathetic side, particularly when it comes to helping others find solace in the bakery.

**Interests:** Nathalie's passions are deeply rooted in her love of baking and creating something beautiful with her hands. She is an avid researcher, constantly seeking out new recipes and techniques to perfect her craft. Her dream of opening a cozy bakery in Ravenswood is not just about creating a business â€“ it's also about finding a sense of belonging and purpose. In addition to baking, Nathalie enjoys spending time outdoors, exploring the surrounding countryside and watching the sunset over the rolling hills.

Outside of her passion for baking, Nathalie has an introspective nature, often lost in thought as she contemplates life's big questions. She is drawn to the mystical and mysterious aspects of Ravenswood, finding comfort in its eerie atmosphere and whispered secrets.
