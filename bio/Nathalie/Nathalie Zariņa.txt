Here is a summary of Nathalie Zari≈Üa's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Nathalie is a determined and analytical detective with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and has a tendency to come across as aloof or standoffish due to her past experiences. However, she is also deeply driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring closure to those affected by crime.

**Physical Attributes:** Nathalie appears to be in her mid-to-late 30s, with an athletic build that suggests she spends time outdoors. Her height is around 5'9" (175 cm), which allows her to move with ease through crowded spaces. Her eyes are a piercing brown, fringed by thick eyelashes that seem to darken when she's concentrating.

**Interests:** Nathalie is deeply passionate about solving crimes and uncovering the truth. She has a keen mind for observation and analysis, which serves her well in her work as a detective. Outside of work, Nathalie enjoys long walks through nature, possibly reflecting on her past experiences and what drives her to seek justice.

**Additional Details:** Based on the story, it seems that Nathalie may have a creative side, perhaps related to art or design (she is familiar with Andris' sketchbook style). This skill may be linked to her fascination with the case and her efforts to understand the motivations behind it.
