**Personality:** Nathalie Ławniczak is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician with an intense passion for understanding fractals. Despite her significant contributions to mathematics, she has always felt like an outsider, which has driven her to explore the hidden patterns of the universe in her work. She is highly introverted and rarely leaves her apartment or speaks to anyone outside of her immediate circle, but when she does interact with others, such as Kasia, she reveals a brilliant and inspiring presence.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Nathalie's fascination with fractals is both intellectual curiosity and a deeply personal quest for understanding. Her work allows her to explore the intricate patterns of the universe in a way that feels both familiar and strange.

In addition to mathematics, it appears that Nathalie enjoys:

* Reading (specifically, books on geometry and mathematics)
* Exploring the mysteries of the universe
* Collaborating with others who share her passion for discovery

It's worth noting that these attributes are inferred from the short story and may not be comprehensive or entirely accurate.
