He also seems to be open-minded and willing to listen, as evidenced by his attentive gaze on the musicians at the café. Additionally, Sebastian's willingness to leave out personal motivations suggests that he may have a more guarded side to his personality.

* History, particularly ancient civilizations and lost cultures
* Mystery and secrets (which draws him to the mysterious island of Kallabergs)
