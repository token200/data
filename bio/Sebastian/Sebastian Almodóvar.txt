Here is a summary of the fictional character Sebastian Almod√≥var:

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastian stands at 6'2" with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are piercing emerald green, a striking feature that seems to gleam in the dim light. A sprinkle of stubble adds to his rugged demeanor.

**Personality:** Sebastian exudes an air of mystery and intrigue, making him both captivating and intimidating. He is a private individual who keeps his emotions and thoughts closely guarded, preferring silence over open discussion. Despite this, he possesses a dry wit and can be surprisingly witty when the mood strikes him. There's an undercurrent of warmth and kindness beneath his reserved exterior, which hints at a more vulnerable side that few have been privileged to witness.

**Interests:** Sebastian seems to appreciate the finer things in life, often indulging in art, nature, and solitude. The intricate tattoo on his forearm suggests a connection to the natural world, perhaps hinting at an affinity for botany or entomology. Music is another area where he might find solace, although this is purely speculative.

**Background:** Unfortunately, Sebastian's past remains shrouded in mystery, with only whispers and speculation circulating about his life before arriving in San Miguel. It's clear that he prefers it that way, however, as evidenced by the creaky door of his old mansion, which seems to have been designed to repel outsiders rather than welcome them.

**Quirks:** Sebastian has a fondness for observing life from afar, often sitting in the gardens of his estate, watching the world go by. He's an avid reader and may spend hours lost in the pages of classic literature or philosophy texts. On stormy nights like the one that brought Sofia to his doorstep, he might find himself drawn to the melancholy atmosphere, feeling a sense of kinship with the turmoil that rages outside.

**Strengths:** Sebastian's reserve can be both an asset and a liability, allowing him to observe and learn from those around him without being easily swayed or manipulated. His dry wit and wry humor can be disarming, making even the most skeptical individuals feel at ease in his presence.

**Weaknesses:** Sebastian's aversion to open discussion might make it difficult for him to form close relationships or connect with others on a deep level. His past remains a closely guarded secret, which may weigh heavily on him and limit his ability to trust others.
