Here's a summary of the fictional character Sebastian Ozols:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sebastian Ozols stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an unassuming build. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which seem to hold a profound intensity in their depths. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly and with minimal maintenance, framing his angular face.

**Personality:**
Sebastian appears to be a quiet and introspective individual who values solitude and has built walls around himself. Despite this, he has an innate curiosity that is stirred by the presence of others, particularly those who appreciate the finer things in life like music. He seems gentle yet guarded, with a slow-burning intensity that hints at a deeper emotional landscape beneath his reserved demeanor.

**Interests:**
Sebastian's interests are closely tied to his love for solitude and contemplation. He finds solace by watching the river flow and observing the world around him, often lost in thought as he tries to make sense of life's complexities. Music plays a pivotal role in bringing people together and creating meaningful connections â€“ an interest that was reignited through his encounter with Lily.

While there is no explicit information on Sebastian's interests outside music or solitude, it can be inferred that his affinity for quiet observation might also include reading (which could help him explore life beyond his town) and, possibly, more esoteric pursuits to satisfy the inner depth-seeker in him.
