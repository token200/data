He is fiercely independent and has a dry sense of humor that he uses to deflect from his own vulnerabilities.

**Background:** Sebastian's background is shrouded in mystery, but it is evident that he comes from a humble or troubled home. His parents are divorced, and he has a complicated relationship with his estranged father, who is rumored to have been involved in some shady dealings. Despite this, Sebastian seems determined to forge his own path and prove himself as a capable detective.

**Quirks:** Sebastian has an uncanny ability to remember even the smallest details of a case, which often proves invaluable in solving it. He also has a habit of tapping his pen on the desk when he's deep in thought or concentrating on a complex puzzle. Despite his analytical nature, he is not afraid to show emotion and can be quite empathetic with those around him.
