Here's a summary of the fictional character Sebastian Marrone:

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastian is a tall and lean individual, with an unkempt mop of dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead. His eyes are a deep, piercing green, almost like emeralds in the dim light. He has a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones, giving him a ruggedly handsome appearance that's weathered from years of hard living.

**Personality:** Sebastian is a brooding and introspective person, often struggling to open up to others due to past traumas and emotional baggage. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a penchant for taking risks and pushing boundaries. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is deeply empathetic towards those who are struggling. However, this vulnerability often gets lost under a layer of sarcasm and self-deprecation.

**Interests:** Sebastian's interests revolve around music, art, and writing. He's an avid reader of literary fiction and poetry, and spends his free time scribbling in a worn leather journal that's been passed down through generations of his family. Music is also a huge passion of his - he plays the guitar and writes songs in his spare moments. In addition to these creative pursuits, Sebastian enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, trying out new whiskey recipes, and indulging in late-night conversations with strangers.

**Additional Details:** Sebastian has a fondness for worn-out leather jackets, which he sees as a symbol of freedom and rebellion. He often wears faded band t-shirts and ripped jeans that are held together by threads and prayers. His style is eclectic and unkempt, reflecting his artistic temperament and free-spirited nature.
