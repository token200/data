Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Sebastian Lewandowska:

**Personality:** Sebastian is a brilliant and reclusive scientist with an intense focus on his work. He has a reserved nature, but is also known for his unconventional methods and ability to think outside the box. Despite his reserved exterior, he is deeply interested in understanding human behavior and psychology, which is reflected in his ability to read people and ask insightful questions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often unkempt and messy
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Sebastian's interests extend beyond neuroscience to include:

* Understanding human behavior and psychology
* Studying the mysteries of the brain and its many complexities
* Reading extensively on philosophy, sociology, and anthropology
* Conducting unconventional experiments and research methods
* Collecting rare books and papers related to his field of study

As a person, Sebastian is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the human condition. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused, but also has a vulnerable side that he only reveals to those close to him.

It's worth noting that these physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, so I've filled in some gaps while still staying true to the character's essence.
