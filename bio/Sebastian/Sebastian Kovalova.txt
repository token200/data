Here is a summary of Sebastian Kovalova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sebastian Kovalova is a charismatic and resourceful individual with a sharp mind and quick wit. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as wry or sarcastic to those who don't know him. Despite his tough exterior, he has a strong sense of justice and is driven by a desire to uncover the truth. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having spent years working outside the mainstream.

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastian stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from his days in special forces. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up or searching for hidden secrets. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that can be both endearing and intimidating.

**Interests:** Sebastian has a wide range of interests, reflecting his varied experiences as a CIA operative and freelance journalist. He is an avid reader and researcher, with a particular fondness for history, politics, and international relations. He is also skilled in multiple languages, including Czech, Russian, and German, which he acquired during his time working undercover.

In addition to his professional pursuits, Sebastian enjoys whiskey (to the point of being quite an aficionado) and has a taste for fine art and music. He is also a bit of a thrill-seeker, always looking for the next big story or adventure that will push him out of his comfort zone.

As a result of his past experiences, Sebastian has a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about, but is also wary of trusting others too easily. This ambivalence makes him a complex and nuanced character, capable of both great kindness and calculated ruthlessness when necessary.
