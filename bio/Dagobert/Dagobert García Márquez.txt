Despite this, Dagobert has a sense of adventure and is willing to take risks when presented with unexpected opportunities. He is also open-minded and receptive to new experiences, as evidenced by his ability to navigate complex puzzles and unlock hidden realities.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Dagobert is likely a middle-aged individual, possibly in his 40s or 50s. His height is not specified, but he appears to be slender and perhaps a bit hunched over due to spending extended periods of time studying at his desk.

Dagobert's eye color is not mentioned, but it is likely that he has dark eyes, given the influence Luna had on him during their encounter.
