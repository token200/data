**Background:**

Éric's Russian heritage and family history have instilled in him a deep appreciation for tradition and cultural identity. His parents, both artists themselves, encouraged his early artistic endeavors, but Éric felt stifled by their expectations to create "Russian art" that adhered to traditional forms. Seeking inspiration from the avant-garde movements of France, he eventually broke away from his family's roots and forged a new path as an independent artist.
