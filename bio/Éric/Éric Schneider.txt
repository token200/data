**Personality:** Éric is a complex individual who appears driven by his work as an astrophysicist. On the surface, he comes across as aloof and absent-minded, often neglecting those around him in pursuit of his research goals. However, beneath this facade lies a multifaceted person with a deep sense of wonder and curiosity. He is passionate about his work and has a strong connection to the universe, which fuels his desire to understand its mysteries.

As he opens up to Sophia, Éric reveals a more vulnerable side, showing a sense of longing for human connection and meaning beyond his professional success. With Sophia's help, he begins to reevaluate his priorities, finding balance between his work and personal life, and developing a renewed sense of purpose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Éric is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, a height that suggests a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: His eyes are bright blue, reflecting his passion for the stars and his intense focus on his work. The brightness of his blue eyes also hints at a sharp mind and quick wit.

**Interests:** Éric's love for astrophysics is rivaled only by his affection for jazz music. He finds solace in the improvisational nature of jazz, which resonates with his own creative approach to research and problem-solving. As he gazes up at the stars with Sophia, he feels a sense of harmony between his love of music and his work in understanding the universe.

Éric also shares a deep appreciation for stargazing and the memories of his childhood spent gazing up at the night sky with his grandfather. This connection to nature and the past serves as a reminder of the importance of human connection and relationships, which Éric had previously neglected in his pursuit of success.
