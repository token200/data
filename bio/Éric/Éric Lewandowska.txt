Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Éric Lewandowska:

**Physical Attributes:** Éric Lewandowska stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. Her striking features include almond-shaped eyes that are an piercing shade of indigo, a trait passed down from her Polish heritage. Her raven-black hair falls in loose waves down her back, often framing her heart-shaped face and chiseled cheekbones. Her full lips curve into an enigmatic smile, hinting at the mysteries within.

**Personality:** Éric Lewandowska is known for her fierce independence, a quality that drives her creative vision. She exudes a quiet confidence, which belies the intensity of her emotions. Those who know her admire her unwavering commitment to her art and her unshakeable sense of self. Her reserved nature can be intimidating, but it also inspires reverence from those around her.

**Interests:** Éric's artistic journey is fueled by her fascination with life itself. She draws inspiration from the intricate dance between people and their surroundings. When not painting, she finds solace in observing the world around her, studying the play of light and shadow on human faces. Her interests also include reading literary classics, particularly the works of Edgar Allan Poe, which seem to mirror the themes present in her art.

**Other Quirks:** Éric has a habit of collecting antique bottles of perfume from various parts of Europe, each one representing a memory or experience that has shaped her artistic vision. She is often found lost in thought, contemplative moments spent on the banks of the Seine or in her Parisian studio, surrounded by canvases and half-finished paintings.

Éric Lewandowska's life is as beautiful as her paintings – a complex tapestry woven from threads of mystery, artistry, and quiet reserve.
