Growing up without his father and struggling with the dark side of life have shaped him into a resilient and determined individual. Despite this, he's still deeply connected to his mother's optimism and values, which keeps him grounded.

**Physical Attributes:** Étienne stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to see right through you. He has a scattering of scars on his face and arms from past encounters, which he's earned over the years.

**Interests:** Étienne is drawn to the darker side of life, fascinated by crime, violence, and corruption. As a result, he spends most of his time investigating and uncovering the truth behind Malmö's underworld. He's also deeply passionate about baking, a skill he learned from his mother, which provides him with a sense of comfort and normalcy in an otherwise chaotic world.

Overall, Étienne is a unique blend of grit and heart, driven by a desire to make a difference in the world and bring justice to those who need it.
