Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Étienne Li's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Étienne Li is a complex individual with a calm and collected demeanor that often hides his true emotions. He has a strong sense of determination and conviction, which drives him to uncover the truth, no matter how old the wounds become. His past experiences have left emotional scars, particularly the unsolved disappearance of his younger sister Adèle, but he continues to be driven by justice.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Étienne Li stands at around 6'1" (185 cm), with a lean yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost piercing in their intensity.
* Hair Color and Style: Étienne's hair is dark brown, often worn neatly combed to the side. He has a subtle scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** As a brilliant detective, Étienne Li is intensely curious about human nature and the intricacies of human behavior. His passion for justice and uncovering the truth is rivaled only by his love for classical literature, particularly the works of Proust and Baudelaire. He enjoys sipping coffee at quaint Parisian cafés, observing the city's rhythms and watching people go about their daily lives.

Étienne Li's interests also include martial arts and fencing, which he practices to maintain physical fitness and mental focus. Despite his busy schedule as a detective, he finds solace in reading and writing poetry late into the night, often at a secluded riverside spot where he can clear his mind.

Overall, Étienne Li is a man of contrasts: a ghostly figure haunting the fringes of society, yet driven by an insatiable pursuit of truth; a logical thinker with a deep emotional wellspring, fueled by tragedy and loss.
