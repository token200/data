Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Étienne Muti:

**Physical Attributes:** Étienne stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of practicing fencing. His hair is dark brown, often unkempt, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to sparkle with intensity when he's in the midst of battle.

**Personality:** Étienne is a fiercely independent individual who has learned to rely on himself from a young age. Growing up on the streets of Marseille has made him resourceful and adaptable, with a quick mind and sharp instincts. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is driven by a sense of justice. Étienne's passion for fencing is matched only by his curiosity about people and the world around him.

**Interests:** Fencing, of course, is Étienne's primary interest. He loves the thrill of competition, the rush of adrenaline when facing off against a worthy opponent, and the satisfaction of mastering a new technique. However, as he gets to know Colette, he becomes fascinated by the art of observation and deduction – trying to uncover secrets and understand the motivations of those around him. Étienne is also drawn to philosophy, particularly existentialism, which resonates with his own experiences on the streets.

Étienne's interests go beyond mere sport; they're a reflection of his deep-seated desire for meaning and connection in life. As he navigates the complexities of fencing and human relationships, Étienne finds himself constantly seeking answers to fundamental questions about existence, identity, and purpose.
