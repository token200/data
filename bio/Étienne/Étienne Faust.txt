Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Étienne Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Étienne is a complex and enigmatic individual with a brooding exterior. He has an intense sense of melancholy that seems to haunt him, which is likely rooted in his troubled past. Despite this, he is a deeply passionate and creative person who values deep connections with others. As he opens up to Sophie, it becomes clear that he is searching for redemption and a sense of belonging.

**Physical Attributes:** Étienne has striking blue eyes and raven-black hair. Unfortunately, no information about his height is provided in the story, so I will assume an average adult male height of around 5'10" (178 cm).

**Interests:**

* Art: Étienne is a talented painter who was once deeply passionate about art.
* Literature: He has a love for literature and values deep conversations with others about the complexities of life, art, and philosophy.

It's worth noting that the story does not provide many details about Étienne's physical appearance beyond his eyes and hair color. As such, I have had to make some assumptions about his height, which may or may not be accurate.

Additionally, while we don't know much about Étienne's social background (beyond the rumors of him being a former soldier or aristocrat), it is clear that he has a deep love for art and literature. His passion for these subjects drives much of his creativity and serves as an outlet for his emotions.

Overall, Étienne Faust seems to be a complex and multifaceted individual with a rich inner life and a deep desire for connection and redemption.
