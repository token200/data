* Face: Strong jawline, piercing eyes, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (from a childhood accident)
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, with a wiry build developed from years of physical labor

**Interests:** Étienne Välja is a man of stories, drawn to tales of adventure, loss, and redemption. He finds solace in the company of others who have known hardship and pain, sharing their experiences like a traveling salesman peddling his wares. His interests include:

* Collecting stories and sharing them with those willing to listen
* Sailing and the sea (having spent years on the Black Sea, where he developed his sailing skills)
