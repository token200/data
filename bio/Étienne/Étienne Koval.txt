**Physical Attributes:** Étienne stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet athletic build, likely developed from his years as a Resistance fighter. His hair is dark brown and slightly unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his rugged charm. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, hinting at the intensity and depth of his emotions.

**Personality:** Étienne exudes an air of quiet introspection, as if he is constantly evaluating his surroundings and weighing the consequences of his actions. This sense of reserve is rooted in his experiences during the war, where he was forced to make difficult decisions and confront unimaginable horrors. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to challenge the status quo when he believes it needs to be challenged.

**Interests:** Étienne's interests are deeply rooted in his past as a Resistance fighter and his experiences during the war. He is fascinated by history, particularly the secrets and conspiracies that lie beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary events. He also has a strong sense of loyalty and duty to those he cares about, particularly his fellow fighters and his friends Pierre and Colette. On a more personal level, Étienne seems drawn to the unknown and the unexplained, often finding himself on the periphery of mystery and intrigue.

**Background:** As mentioned in the short story, Étienne is a former French Resistance fighter who fought against the Nazis during World War II. He has since returned to his small village in the French countryside, where he tries to live a quiet life. However, his past continues to haunt him, and he finds himself drawn into a new mystery that threatens to upend everything he thought he knew about his world.

Overall, Étienne Koval is a complex and nuanced character with a rich backstory and a deep sense of introspection and curiosity. His experiences during the war have left an indelible mark on him, shaping his personality and worldview in profound ways.
