**Personality:** Étienne Meinstein is a driven and meticulous individual with an unyielding passion for his craft. He is fiercely dedicated to creating masterpieces that exceed expectations, and his dedication is matched only by his humility.

**Interests:** Étienne Meinstein's primary interests lie within the realm of horology (the study of timekeeping devices) and clockmaking. He is fascinated by the intricate mechanisms and precision-crafted gears that go into creating these timepieces, often finding himself lost in thought as he ponders the intricacies of clockwork design. When not working on his own projects or collaborating with colleagues, Étienne Meinstein enjoys taking long walks outside to clear his mind, observing the passage of time as it ebbs and flows around him.
