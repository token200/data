Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Étienne Novák:

**Personality:** Étienne appears to be a nostalgic and introspective person who values his connections with others and the places he holds dear. He seems to be someone who cherishes his childhood friendships and is willing to take time off from his life to reconnect with old friends. He also seems to be creative, as evidenced by his ability to find solace in the magic of Ravenswood.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the passage, we can infer that Étienne is a tall person, likely between 6'0" to 6'2", as he is described as "stepping off the train and onto the worn platform". His eye color is not explicitly mentioned, but his eyes are said to have scanned the station with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation, suggesting that they may be expressive and perceptive.

**Interests:** Étienne's interests seem to include reconnecting with old friends and revisiting places from his past. He appears to be someone who values the magic of Ravenswood and is drawn to its history and community. As a writer himself (although not explicitly stated), he likely has an interest in literature, storytelling, and creative expression.

It's worth noting that Étienne's character is largely inferred through his interactions with Léon and the environment of Ravenswood. We don't know much about his personal life or motivations beyond this initial visit to reconnect with his friend.
