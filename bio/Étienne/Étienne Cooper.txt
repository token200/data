Here is a summary of Étienne Cooper's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Étienne is an enigmatic figure with a razor-sharp mind and a tendency to remain aloof. He has a dry sense of humor and seems to approach interactions with caution, as if observing his surroundings rather than being fully present in them. Despite this reserved nature, he exudes an air of authority and intelligence that commands attention.

**Physical Attributes:** Étienne stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, suggesting a life of physical activity and mental stimulation. His striking feature is his piercing blue eyes, which seem to see right through those he meets. His hair is dark and unkempt, framing his angular face, and he often wears wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose.

**Interests:** Étienne appears to be a collector and enthusiast of dusty artifacts, peculiar objects, and strange contraptions. He has a deep fascination with ancient texts and seems to spend most of his time studying and analyzing these sources. His interest in codes and ciphers is evident, as he effortlessly decodes the enigmatic messages within the ancient tome that Léa discovers. Additionally, Étienne's connection to other realms or unseen dimensions suggests that he has an intuitive understanding of mystical and metaphysical concepts.

It is worth noting that Étienne's past is shrouded in mystery, making it impossible to discern more information about his background, motivations, or long-term goals. However, through his interactions with Léa, we can begin to piece together the intricate mechanisms of his mind and uncover the hidden patterns that govern his actions.
