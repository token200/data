**Physical Attributes:** Caroline is likely a woman in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build, suggesting she's physically fit from years of exercise and possibly even some background in martial arts or self-defense. Her eye color is brown, a warm and earthy shade that contrasts with her cool, analytical demeanor.

**Interests:** Caroline is passionate about solving mysteries and bringing justice to victims. She has a deep respect for the law and a strong sense of duty to use her skills to make a positive impact on society. In her free time, she likely enjoys reading, particularly true crime novels and biographies that explore the human condition. She may also be interested in science fiction, history, or philosophy, given her analytical mind.

**Additional Traits:** Caroline is resourceful and adaptable, able to think on her feet and adjust her approach as needed. She's a good communicator and has strong relationships with her colleagues, particularly her partner Detective Mike Harris.
