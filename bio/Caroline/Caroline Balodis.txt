**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of golden flecks
* Hair: Dark hair that gets whipped into a frenzy in windy conditions

**Personality:**
Caroline is a introspective and emotional person who wears her heart on her sleeve. She has a deep connection to the natural world, particularly the lake and its surroundings, which holds sentimental value for her family's past. She is also someone who values simplicity, comfort, and community. Caroline appears to be someone who is deeply affected by loss (her father's passing) and is still navigating her way through grief. However, with Finn by her side, she seems more at peace.

**Interests:**

* Spending time outdoors, particularly near Lake Erie
* Reflecting on memories and experiences from her past
* Connecting with nature and the elements (the wind, the waves, the sky)
* Sharing moments of tenderness and comfort with loved ones (her mother's tales, Finn's gentle touch)
* Finding solace in quiet, introspective moments
