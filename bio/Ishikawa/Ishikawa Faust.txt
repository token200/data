**Personality:** Ishikawa Faust is ambitious, driven, and intensely curious. He has a strong desire to unlock the secrets of alchemy, which motivates him to push beyond the boundaries of human knowledge.

As the story progresses, however, Ishikawa Faust becomes increasingly detached, shallow, and isolated. He struggles to form genuine connections with others, as if he's lost touch with his own desires and emotions due to The Patron's influence.

**Physical Attributes:** Ishikawa Faust is a young man of average build and height (around 5'10" or 178 cm). His eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, a trait that becomes more pronounced as the years pass. This unique eye color seems to take on a haunting, otherworldly glow in the right light.

His interests are centered around understanding the underlying laws of nature and harnessing their power to create something new and extraordinary.

As The Patron's influence takes hold, Ishikawa Faust's priorities shift from intellectual pursuits to serving his mysterious patron. His interests become more aligned with The Patron's goals, which further fuels his sense of detachment and isolation.
