Despite her many gifts, María remains humble and grounded, never seeking to draw attention to herself or boast of her accomplishments.

**Interests:** María's connection to the spirits and the natural world drives much of her curiosity and interest. She is drawn to the mysteries of the forest, spending hours exploring its depths and learning from its ancient wisdom. When not tending to the needs of those around her, María enjoys meditating in the hidden glade where she first discovered her gift, communing with the spirits that reside there. She is also deeply interested in the art of healing, often studying traditional remedies and techniques passed down through generations of Tokushima's spiritual leaders.

She finds solace in the intricate patterns and designs that emerge from these ancient art forms, seeing parallels between them and the rhythms of nature itself.

**Values:** María's values are rooted in respect for the land, its creatures, and the spirits that inhabit both. She believes in living in harmony with nature, taking only what she needs and leaving the rest to flourish. Her compassion and empathy for others drive her actions, as she seeks to heal wounds, soothe troubled hearts, and offer guidance when needed.

**Goals:** María's ultimate goal is to continue using her gifts to protect and serve the people of Tokushima, guiding them toward a deeper understanding of their connection to the natural world. She hopes to one day establish a sacred site, where she can teach others about the art of communicating with spirits and harnessing the power of nature for healing and growth.

**Fears:** Like many who have grown up in the shadows, María has known hardship and loss. Her greatest fear is losing touch with her connection to the spirits or failing to protect those who depend on her guidance.
