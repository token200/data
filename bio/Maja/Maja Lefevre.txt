**Personality:** Maja Lefevre is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, she appears confident and self-assured, but beneath lies a deep-seated desire for stability and belonging. She has a strong sense of wanderlust and a thirst for adventure, which drove her to leave Ravenswood as soon as possible after childhood. However, as she's grown older, this restlessness has given way to a more profound longing for roots and a sense of home.
