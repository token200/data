Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Maja Vuorinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Maja is a complex and introspective individual with a calm exterior that belies a turbulent inner world. She is reserved and may come across as aloof or elusive to those who don't know her well, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep sense of emotion and desire. As a child, she struggled to find emotional support from her parents, which led to her developing a coping mechanism of observing and listening rather than speaking. However, as she grew older, she channeled these emotions into her artistry.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Jet black

There is no mention of Maja's hair color in the short story, so I've chosen a dark color to complement her overall appearance. Her height and eye color are inferred from the narrative, with her being tall enough to stand out in a crowded space (implying that she might have felt like an outsider due to her size as a child) and having deep, expressive eyes.

**Interests:**

* Painting: Maja is a talented painter who finds solace in capturing the world around her on canvas. Her artistry serves as an outlet for her emotions and desires.
* Art history: While not explicitly stated, it's possible that Maja has a deep appreciation for art history, given her talent and attention to detail.

In terms of interests beyond art, there isn't much information provided in the short story. However, based on her experiences and personality, it might be inferred that she is drawn to:

* Self-discovery: Given her struggles with emotional support from her parents, Maja may have a strong desire for self-awareness and understanding.
* Personal growth: As she navigates her artistry and personal life, Maja may be interested in exploring themes of identity, resilience, and empowerment.

Keep in mind that these are inferences based on the provided narrative, and additional context might reveal more about Maja's interests and personality.
