Based on the character of Maya Kalis, I can create a new fictional character named Maja Kalejs. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Maja Kalejs is a 28-year-old visual artist with a slender build and stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm). Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, a unique feature that sets her apart from others. Her dark hair is often worn in a messy bob, framing her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:**
Maja Kalejs is a creative and introspective individual with a passion for self-expression. She is deeply empathetic and has a strong connection to the emotions of those around her, which inspires her art. Maja is also fiercely independent and values her alone time, often spending hours lost in thought or working on new projects.

**Interests:**
Maja's artistic interests lie at the intersection of abstraction and surrealism. She finds inspiration in the world's mystique and symbolism, often incorporating these elements into her work. In addition to art, Maja enjoys reading philosophy, poetry, and fiction novels that explore complex themes and human experiences. When not creating or reading, she can be found practicing yoga or hiking in nature.

While Maja Kalejs shares some similarities with Maya Kalis, I've created distinct details to make her a unique character.
