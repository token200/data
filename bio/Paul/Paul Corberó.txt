Since there is no information available on the fictional character Paul Corberó, I'll create a fictional character profile for him. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Paul Corberó is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look perpetually sleepy. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that seem to see right through you.

**Personality:**
Paul is a free-spirited individual who lives life on his own terms. He's a bit of a rebel and has a mischievous sense of humor that often gets him into trouble. Despite this, he has a good heart and would do anything for the people he cares about. Paul is fiercely loyal and will stop at nothing to protect those he considers friends.

**Interests:**
Paul is passionate about music, particularly rock and punk bands. He's always on the lookout for new and emerging artists, and his friends often joke that he has a " sixth sense" for discovering hidden gems. When he's not working or socializing, Paul loves to explore new places, try new foods, and indulge in late-night gaming sessions.

Feel free to add any additional details or context you'd like, and I can help develop Paul Corberó into a fully fleshed-out character!
