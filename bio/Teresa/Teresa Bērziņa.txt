Based on the provided short story about Ilze Bērziņa, I will create a fictional character profile for Teresa Bērziņa:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark blonde
* Build: Athletic and toned, with a lean physique

**Personality:**

Teresa is a driven and focused individual, much like her inspiration Ilze. She is determined to excel in her chosen field, whether it be speed skating or another sport. Her confidence and competitiveness can sometimes make her come across as assertive or even aggressive, but deep down she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

**Interests:**

* Speed skating (naturally!)
* Running
* Hiking and outdoor activities
* Reading motivational self-help books
* Listening to music from various genres, especially electronic and indie

**Background:**
Teresa grew up in a small town near the Baltic Sea, where she developed a passion for speed skating at a young age. She trained extensively under her mother's guidance, who was also an avid athlete herself. As Teresa honed her skills, she began to emulate Ilze's drive and work ethic, striving to become one of the best in the sport.

**Goals:**
Teresa aims to represent Latvia in international speed skating competitions, breaking records and winning medals to make her country proud. She is also committed to helping young athletes develop their skills, just as Ilze did for her.

While this profile draws inspiration from Ilze Bērziņa, it represents a fictional character of Teresa Bērziņa with unique characteristics.
