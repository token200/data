Here's a summary of the fictional character Teresa Lewis:

**Physical Attributes:** Teresa is a petite woman, standing at around 5'4" (162 cm) with long, dark brown hair and expressive hazel eyes. Her features are delicate yet determined, reflecting her strong personality.

**Personality:** Teresa is a kind-hearted, gentle soul with a dry sense of humor. She is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them. Despite facing unimaginable hardship and injustice, she remains resilient and hopeful, with an unwavering dedication to clearing her name.

**Interests:** In her free time, Teresa enjoys reading, writing poetry, and practicing yoga. These pursuits help her maintain a sense of calm and inner peace, even in the face of adversity. She is also an avid learner, always seeking out new knowledge and experiences to expand her horizons.

It's worth noting that while I've created these attributes based on the inspiration provided, they are not representative of the real Teresa Lewis, who was wrongly convicted of a heinous crime and later exonerated. This fictional character is purely a representation, and any resemblance to the actual person is coincidental.
