**Physical Attributes:**
Teresa Põld is likely to be an adult woman, possibly in her 30s or 40s. She has an unassuming presence, as described by Sofia's initial impression that she was met with a "reserved smile." However, this doesn't necessarily imply shyness or introversion; rather, it suggests that Teresa Põld is guarded and selective about the people she lets into her inner circle.

In terms of physical appearance, the story doesn't provide much detail. However, given her profession as a sculptor, it's possible that Teresa Põld has hands and arms that are strong and capable, with some level of calluses or scars from working with hot metal. Her eye color is not mentioned, but assuming she's an Estonian artist (as suggested by the surname "Põld"), her eyes might be blue or green.

**Personality:**
Teresa Põld is a complex and multifaceted individual, driven by a deep emotional need to explore the human experience through her art. She is not motivated by fame or fortune, instead creating solely for herself and her own sense of satisfaction. This suggests that she values autonomy and creative freedom above external validation.

Beneath her stoic exterior, Teresa Põld is revealed to be vulnerable and emotionally expressive when interacting with Sofia. This contrast between her public persona and private emotions implies a depth and nuance to her personality that may not be immediately apparent to those who don't know her.

**Interests:**
As an artist, Teresa Põld's primary interest lies in creating sculpture using various metals, particularly copper and steel. Her work is characterized by its unorthodox approach, which defies explanation and sparks curiosity in those who encounter it.

Beyond art, Teresa Põld seems to value the emotional connection she forms with others, as evidenced by her bond with Sofia. She appears to be someone who is drawn to deep conversations and meaningful relationships, seeking out people who can understand and appreciate her inner world.

In terms of specific interests or hobbies, the story doesn't provide much information beyond Teresa Põld's art and her connection with Sofia. However, it can be inferred that she enjoys the process of creating, experimenting with different materials and techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible in sculpture.
