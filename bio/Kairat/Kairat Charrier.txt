**Physical Attributes:**
Kairat is likely a slender and agile individual. Given his profession as an operative, he has undergone rigorous training that would have honed his physical skills to perfection. He probably stands between 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing brown or blue eyes. His exact eye color isn't mentioned in the story, but considering his mysterious nature and the rarity of his appearance, it's possible he has an unusual eye color such as hazel or amber.

**Personality:**
Kairat is described as a reclusive figure, which suggests that he is private and prefers to keep to himself. His past experiences have likely made him wary of trusting others, leading to a life of solitude. However, this also means he has honed his skills in surveillance, infiltration, and manipulation, making him an expert in the art of deception.

As a master of espionage, Kairat is confident, resourceful, and intelligent. He seems to have a strong sense of self-preservation and will go to great lengths to protect himself and those close to him.

He appears to have a strong sense of satisfaction derived from completing high-stakes missions that others wouldn't dare touch. His reputation as a ghostly figure has struck fear into the hearts of those who cross him, indicating he takes pride in his ability to outmaneuver his opponents.

Outside of espionage, Kairat's interests are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that he values independence and freedom above all else. His decision to leave his previous agency and operate on his own terms suggests that he craves autonomy and the ability to make choices unencumbered by external expectations.
