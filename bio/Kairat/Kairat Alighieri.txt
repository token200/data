Here's a summary of Kairat Alighieri's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Kairat Alighieri is 5'9" (175 cm) tall with an athletic build. He has short, dark brown hair that's often messy and unkempt. His eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, almost purple in color. He has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist.

**Personality:**
Kairat is a free-spirited individual with a mischievous streak. He's fiercely independent and values his autonomy above all else. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of his way to help those less fortunate. Kairat is a natural troublemaker, often taking risks that put him at odds with authority figures.
