Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Reece Stenström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Reece Stenström appears to be a determined and driven individual who is passionate about her work as a marine biologist. She is likely curious, analytical, and loves solving mysteries. Her colleagues' jokes about finding a single grain of sand with ease suggest that she is also somewhat quirky and has a dry sense of humor.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much information about Reece Stenström's physical appearance. However, based on her profession and interests, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Reece Stenström might be around 5'6" to 5'8", which is a typical height range for marine biologists who need to be agile and comfortable in water.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but given her interest in the ocean, she might have blue or green eyes that sparkle with excitement when exploring the underwater world.

**Interests:** Reece Stenström's interests are centered around marine biology, specifically the unique ecosystem of coastal waters. She is fascinated by:

* Crustaceans (like crabs) and other tiny creatures that inhabit the ocean
* The interactions between different species in the food chain
* Uncovering the secrets of the ocean and its mysteries

Additionally, she enjoys exploring the outdoors, particularly on beaches and near the coast, where she can observe and collect data about marine life. Her love for the ocean is evident, and her work as a marine biologist allows her to explore and understand this vast and complex ecosystem.

It's worth noting that Reece Stenström seems like a solitary individual who enjoys her own company, as evidenced by her focus on collecting samples and running simulations in the stormy weather. She appears to be content with spending time alone, lost in thought, contemplating the mysteries of the ocean.
