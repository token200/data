Interests:
Reece has a deep passion for unraveling mysteries and exposing corruption, which drives her to take on high-stakes cases like Marcus Thompson's embezzlement scheme. She's always on the lookout for the next challenge, one that will test her skills and push her limits. Outside of work, Reece is likely drawn to activities that involve strategy, puzzle-solving, or something equally cerebral.

Background (inferred from the short story):
Reece seems to have a reputation as an unconventional private investigator, possibly due to her unorthodox methods or her willingness to take risks that others wouldn't. This suggests she may have built a name for herself in the industry by being fearless and willing to push boundaries, which has earned her both respect and skepticism from her peers.
