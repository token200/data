Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Reece Krūmiņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Reece Krūmiņš stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a striking shade of cerulean blue, often described as "Latvian sky blue" by her friends and family. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a Latvian folk design on her left wrist and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Personality:**
Reece is an ambitious and creative individual with a passion for art and self-expression. She's determined, driven, and always strives to push beyond her limits. Her love for Latvia's culture and history has instilled in her a sense of pride and responsibility to share it with the world through her art. Reece is also fiercely independent and values her alone time, often spending hours lost in thought or exploring new parts of the city.

**Interests:**
Reece is an avid fan of Latvian literature and music, often finding inspiration in the works of famous authors like Jānis Poruņiņš and artists like Mihails Uķers. She's also a coffee aficionado and can often be found sipping on strong brews at her favorite cafes. In her free time, Reece enjoys practicing yoga, experimenting with new art techniques, and exploring the city's street art scene.

**Quirks:**
Reece has a habit of whispering "Rīga" (the Latvian pronunciation for Riga) when she's nervous or deep in thought, as if it brings her good luck. She's also been known to carry a small sketchbook and pencils with her wherever she goes, always ready to capture a moment or inspiration that strikes her.
