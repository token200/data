Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Reece Ospanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Reece Ospanov appears to be a resourceful and determined individual who has learned from her experiences. Despite growing up in a family with a notorious thief for a father, she seems to have distanced herself from her past life of petty crime. However, it's clear that she still carries some emotional baggage from her childhood, as evidenced by her feelings of nostalgia and being an outsider in Ravenswood. Reece also appears to be fiercely independent and determined to leave her past behind.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are explicitly mentioned in the story. However, based on the context, we can make a few educated guesses:

* Height: Reece is likely of average or slightly above-average height for an adult female, considering that she grew up in a small town where crime was prevalent.
* Eye Color: Given her background and possible connections to the underworld, it's possible that Reece has dark-colored eyes, such as brown or black. However, this is purely speculative.

**Interests:** Based on the story, we can infer some of Reece's interests:

* Mechanics and cars: As a mechanic at a local garage, Reece seems to have a passion for working with engines and fixing things.
* Cars in general: The fact that she was initially drawn to hotwiring cars suggests that she has an interest in high-performance vehicles or the thrill of driving fast cars.
* Problem-solving and tinkering: As a mechanic, Reece likely enjoys taking things apart and putting them back together again, which is a hallmark of problem-solving skills.

Keep in mind that these attributes are speculative based on limited information from the short story. Further development of Reece Ospanov's character would be needed to fully flesh out her personality, interests, and motivations.
