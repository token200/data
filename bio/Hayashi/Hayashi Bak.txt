**Physical Attributes:**
Hayashi Bak is likely a lean and agile individual. Given his background in ninjutsu, it's possible that he has a athletic build and is trained to be nimble and quick. His height is not specified, but based on the context of ninja training and espionage work, it's likely that he is around 5'8" to 6'0" (173 cm to 183 cm) tall.

His eye color is not mentioned in the story, but considering his East Asian heritage, it's possible that he has brown or hazel eyes.

**Personality:**

He is a master of persuasion, able to tailor his approach to each situation and build rapport with others. His calm and composed demeanor allows him to remain neutral in tense situations, making him an effective infiltrator.

However, this also means that he may come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him.

This allows him to tailor his approach to each situation and build strong relationships with others.

He is also a skilled researcher and strategist, always planning several steps ahead of his opponents. His passion for espionage and infiltration drives him to continuously improve his skills and adapt to new situations.

In his free time (if he has any), Hayashi Bak might enjoy reading books on philosophy, psychology, or sociology, as well as engaging in intellectual debates with fellow ninjas.
