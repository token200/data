Here's a summary of Hayashi Walker's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Hayashi is a rugged and introspective individual who has spent years honing his skills as a former mercenary and tracker. He exudes a sense of calm confidence and determination, which allows him to navigate treacherous situations with ease. Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and an unyielding sense of justice, making him a formidable ally. However, his past experiences have also left emotional scars, and he struggles with confrontation and forming close relationships.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a messy, stubbled style
* Build: Athletic and muscular, honed from years of physical labor and combat training

**Interests:**

* Tracking and hunting wild game
* Exploring the wilderness and charting unmapped territories
* Reading and studying cartography, geology, and forensic science to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and technologies.
* Whiskey and cigarettes - he has a fondness for both and can often be found enjoying one or the other after a long day of work.

As a former mercenary, Hayashi has an unwavering commitment to tracking down those who evade justice, rather than supernatural creatures. He is driven by a strong sense of responsibility to protect others and make amends for past mistakes. His interests in exploration and research serve as a means to satisfy his curiosity about the world around him and stay focused on solving complex problems.

It's worth noting that while Hayashi has many rugged qualities, he also possesses a deep sense of vulnerability and empathy. Despite being haunted by the ghosts of his past, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares for, particularly Kana, who has become an unlikely ally in his quiet life.
