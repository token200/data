Here's a summary of Hayashi Kowalski's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Hayashi Kowalski is a brooding and introspective individual. He has a past as a former hitman that has left emotional scars, making him wary of getting close to people or forming attachments. Despite this, he has a strong sense of self-preservation and will not hesitate to defend himself if necessary. Kowalski's dry wit and gruff demeanor serve as a defense mechanism, hiding his vulnerabilities beneath the surface. However, when he meets Lily, he begins to show glimpses of vulnerability and openness.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - This height suggests an imposing presence, which may have been useful for Kowalski's career as a hitman.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - The darkness of his eyes gives him a mysterious and intense appearance, fitting for someone with a troubled past.

**Interests:** 

* Fixing things and working with his hands (as evidenced by his job as a handyman)
* Drinking whiskey (he enjoys sipping it by the fireplace at night)
* Hiking and exploring nature (his appreciation for the crisp mountain air and scenery suggests that he values solitude in nature)
* Reading or observing literature (Lily mentions their conversation about Kowalski's past, implying that he may have a fondness for storytelling)

Additionally, considering his background as a hitman, it is likely that Kowalski has:

* A strong sense of discipline and control
* Experience with tactical planning and strategy
* Familiarity with firearms (he sold them, but this knowledge remains)
* A practical and resourceful mindset

However, it's also apparent that Kowalski longs for a simpler life, free from the burdens of his past.
