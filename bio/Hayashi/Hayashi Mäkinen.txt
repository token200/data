Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Hayashi Mäkinen:

**Personality:** Hayashi Mäkinen is an enigmatic and brilliant scientist with an unyielding passion for his work. He is consumed by his research, driven by an insatiable hunger to unlock the secrets of the universe. This obsession often comes at a cost, however, as he has a largely isolated personal life, with no close friends or family. His mercurial temperament and tendency towards erratic mood swings make him a feared figure among his colleagues.

* Facial Features: High cheekbones, sharp jawline, and an angular face that gives him a hawk-like appearance.

**Interests:** Hayashi's primary interest is uncovering the secrets of the universe through scientific research. He is particularly drawn to quantum physics and the potential applications of quantum entanglement in creating sustainable energy sources. His work on "Elysium," a project aimed at harnessing this power, dominates his waking hours.

Other interests and hobbies are scarce, as Hayashi's obsessive personality has led him to neglect personal relationships and outside pursuits in favor of his scientific endeavors. Despite this, he is deeply passionate about learning and expanding his knowledge, which drives him to continue pushing the boundaries of human understanding.

It's worth noting that little is known about Hayashi's childhood or upbringing, aside from his prodigious talent for mathematics and physics. His parents, both accomplished scientists themselves, likely played a significant role in nurturing his early interests and encouraging his academic pursuits.
