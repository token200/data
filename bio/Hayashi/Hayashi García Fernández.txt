**Interests:** Hayashi has a deep passion for whiskey, which he has learned to appreciate during his time in the war. He is an expert mixologist and enjoys experimenting with different spirits and recipes. He also has a love for literature, particularly poetry, and often finds solace in the works of Spanish writers like Lorca and Cervantes.

Outside of his work at the bar, Hayashi enjoys taking long walks under the stars, watching sunsets behind the mountains, and engaging in deep conversations with those who are willing to listen. He has a fondness for music, particularly classical guitar, which he finds soothing and calming.

As he navigates life alongside Sofia, Hayashi is drawn to activities that bring people together, such as hosting impromptu poetry readings or whiskey tastings at the bar. His ultimate goal is to create a sanctuary where broken souls can find healing and redemption, just as Sofia has done for him.
