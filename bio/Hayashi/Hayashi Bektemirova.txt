Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Hayashi Bektemirova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Hayashi Bektemirova appears to be a determined and driven individual. She has spent months working on a challenging case with little success, showing her resilience and dedication to solving it. However, she also seems to have a somewhat skeptical and even defensive side, as hinted by her initial reaction to the chief's unexpected visit. Despite this, she is ultimately grateful for his guidance and willing to listen.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the story, so I will make some assumptions:

* Age: Late 20s to early 30s
* Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or hazel, which could be a reflection of her Japanese heritage

**Interests:** As the lead investigator for the Tokyo Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Hayashi Bektemirova likely has a strong interest in solving puzzles and uncovering hidden clues. She may also enjoy research and analysis, given her ability to pour over evidence and interview witnesses.

It's worth noting that these assumptions are based on a single short story, so more context would be needed to create a more comprehensive picture of Hayashi Bektemirova's personality, physical attributes, and interests.
