**Personality:** Shimizu is an adventurous and determined individual who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about the past. She is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to think on her feet and navigate treacherous terrain with ease. Her passion for discovery drives her to take risks that others might deem foolhardy, but she is never short on confidence or courage. Despite this, Zhunussova has a compassionate side, always willing to listen to stories from the people whose lives she encounters.
