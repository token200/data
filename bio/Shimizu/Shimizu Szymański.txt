Based on the inspiration from Lukasz Szymański, I've created a fictional character profile for Shimizu Szymański.

**Name:** Shimizu Szymański (pronounced "shee-mee-zoh-zheh-mahn-see")

**Age:** 25 (born in 1998)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 183 cm (6 ft)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, reminiscent of a clear Japanese summer sky
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey fashion
* Skin Tone: Smooth, sun-kissed complexion with hints of olive undertones

**Personality:** Shimizu is an intense and focused individual, always striving to improve his game. He's a natural leader on the field, often taking charge of his team's defense and coordinating their efforts. Off the pitch, he's humble and kind, with a dry sense of humor that catches those close to him off guard.

**Interests:** Outside of football, Shimizu is passionate about music, particularly Japanese folk and rock genres. He's an avid fan of local Tokyo bands and has even been known to sneak away from training sessions to attend underground concerts. When not listening to music or watching movies, he enjoys hiking and exploring Japan's beautiful countryside.

**Background:** Born in Tokyo, Shimizu grew up playing football with his friends in the Japanese streets. He joined a local club as a teenager and quickly rose through the ranks, earning a spot on the Polish national team through a combination of natural talent and hard work. Now, he's determined to make a name for himself not just in Poland but globally.

This profile should give you a sense of who Shimizu Szymański might be!
