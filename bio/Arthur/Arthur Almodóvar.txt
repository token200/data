Here's a summary of Arthur Almodóvar's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Arthur Almodóvar stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build. His piercing green eyes seem to gleam with intensity, often hinting at the cunning mind behind his actions. His dark hair is always perfectly styled, framing his chiseled features and sharp jawline. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his early art thefts.

**Personality:** Arthur's personality is multifaceted, with layers that reveal themselves only to those close enough. On the surface, he appears charismatic and confident, exuding an air of authority that commands respect.

Arthur's code of honor guides his actions, making him fiercely loyal to those in need and unwilling to compromise on his principles.

Arthur's interests also extend beyond the world of art, with a deep appreciation for music, literature, and philosophy. He is an avid collector of rare books and antiques, which he has acquired through his... extracurricular activities.

In his rare moments of downtime, Arthur can often be found sketching in his hidden studio or lost in the pages of a favorite novel. Despite his enigmatic nature, he has a deep love for life's complexities and contradictions, which fuels his own creative endeavors as The Fox.
