Based on the short story, here is a summary of Arthur Aurelius Antoninus Augustus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arthur is a wise, just, and compassionate leader who values independence and self-determination. He possesses a strong sense of justice and will not compromise his principles to serve the interests of others, as seen in his rejection of Caligula's proposal for an alliance with Rome. Arthur is also a quick learner and a seeker of knowledge, often seeking guidance from wise sages like Hermes.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide specific details about Arthur's physical appearance, including height and eye color. However, I can make some educated guesses based on historical context:

* Height: Given his association with ancient Egypt, which was known for its tall people, it is possible that Arthur stands around 5'10" (178 cm) to 6'2" (188 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: As a person of Roman descent in Egypt, Arthur's eye color may have been influenced by both Mediterranean and Middle Eastern genetic traits. A likely candidate for his eye color would be brown or hazel.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Arthur is:

* Interested in philosophy and wisdom, as evident from his study of Stoicism and Epicureanism under Hermes' guidance.
* Passionate about justice and fairness, demonstrated by his rejection of Caligula's proposal for an alliance that would have enriched Rome at Egypt's expense.
* Focused on leadership and governance, with a commitment to navigating the complex waters of politics with wisdom and compassion.
* Adventurous and open-minded, having grown up in a foreign land and seeking knowledge from sages like Hermes.

Overall, Arthur Aurelius Antoninus Augustus appears to be a thoughtful, courageous, and wise leader who will navigate the challenges of ruling Egypt with integrity and justice.
