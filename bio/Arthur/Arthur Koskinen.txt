**Interests:**

- **Hacking**: Arthur's primary interest is in hacking, specifically creating malware that can infiltrate secure networks. This fascination with the digital world drives his actions and provides a sense of purpose.
- **Cat-and-Mouse Games**: As someone who has spent years evading law enforcement, Arthur enjoys (or at least tolerates) these games as they provide a thrill and keep him on his toes.
- **Reconnection with Fellow Hackers**: Despite the risks involved, Arthur seems drawn to reconnecting with fellow hackers, particularly those from past groups. This suggests that while he may be in hiding, there is still a sense of camaraderie or shared identity among cybercrime operatives.
