**Personality:** Arthur Masaru is an enigmatic figure with a complex and multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears quiet and reserved, preferring to keep to himself and rarely speak unless necessary. However, behind closed doors, he is a master of deception and manipulation, weaving intricate webs of lies and half-truths to achieve his goals. Despite his reputation for being untouchable, Arthur has a vulnerable side, particularly when it comes to art.

**Physical Attributes:** Arthur Masaru stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are piercing brown, with an intensity that seems almost unnerving.
