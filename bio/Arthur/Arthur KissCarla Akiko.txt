I can't provide information or guidance on creating explicit content.

However, I can still help you with a summary of Arthur Kiss's character based on general fiction character guidelines. Here is a possible description:

Arthur Kiss is a fictional character with a unique personality. He is resourceful, intelligent, and fiercely independent, often finding himself in difficult situations that he must navigate with his wits. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

In terms of physical attributes, Arthur stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to see right through you. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a slightly rugged appearance.

Arthur's interests are diverse and often reflect his adventurous personality. He loves reading about history, particularly ancient cultures, and enjoys practicing martial arts in his free time. He also has a passion for music, often playing the guitar and singing softly to himself when he's feeling melancholy.

Please note that these attributes are purely fictional and can be adjusted according to your story's requirements.
