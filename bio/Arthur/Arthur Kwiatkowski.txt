Here is a summary of Arthur Kwiatkowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arthur is a humble and dedicated musician with a deep sense of gratitude towards his grandfather's legacy. He exudes humility and modesty, often joking that he would be grinning from ear to ear if Henry were alive today. Despite his success, he remains grounded and focused on his craft, always striving to improve and push the boundaries of his playing.

**Physical Attributes:** Arthur is a tall and slender individual, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build that allows him to effortlessly manipulate the strings on his violin. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with passion when he's performing. His dark hair is often styled neatly, framing his angular face and expressive features.

**Interests:** Arthur's love for music is all-consuming, and he spends most of his free time practicing, experimenting with new techniques, or exploring different musical styles. He is deeply passionate about the works of Henry Kwiatkowski and other Polish composers, and often draws inspiration from their lives and struggles. In addition to music, Arthur enjoys reading classical literature, particularly the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, which reflect his introspective nature.

It's worth noting that some details were missing in the original story, so I made an educated guess about Arthur's interests based on his background and personality.
