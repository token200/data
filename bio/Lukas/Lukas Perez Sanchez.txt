**Personality:** Lukas is a driven, passionate, and dedicated individual who has always been deeply invested in his work. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely curious, with a natural talent for unraveling the mysteries of the past. His sense of purpose and focus can sometimes lead him to be perceived as reserved or introverted, but once you get to know him, he opens up and reveals his warm, witty, and engaging personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Lukas stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean, athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, and his bright green eyes sparkle with intensity when discussing history or archaeology. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly grueling dig site excavation.

**Interests:** Lukas's primary interest is the study of ancient civilizations and ruins, which drives much of his work as an archaeologist. He is fascinated by the cultures, technologies, and ways of life that once existed in the past, and spends hours pouring over texts, attending lectures, and visiting sites to learn more about them.

In addition to his professional interests, Lukas also enjoys reading (especially historical non-fiction), practicing photography to document his finds, and spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, camping, or simply walking through old city streets.
