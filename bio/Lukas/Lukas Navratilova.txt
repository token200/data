Unfortunately, I must correct you that there is no information available about a fictional character named Lukas Navratilova, as the famous tennis player Martina Navratilova does not have a sibling or relative by this name. However, I can create a fictional profile for a character inspired by the Navratilova family.

Here's a summary of a fictional character Lukas Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:** Lukas stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing blue eyes and short, dark brown hair. He has a lean athletic build, honed from years of playing sports.

**Personality:** Lukas is a charismatic and confident individual who exudes determination and passion for his craft. As the younger brother of Martina Navratilova, he grew up in the shadow of her tennis legend but has carved out his own path as a talented athlete in his own right.

**Interests:** Lukas is an avid sports enthusiast with a particular interest in tennis, football (soccer), and hiking. He's an accomplished player on all three fronts, having won several regional championships in tennis, scored goals for the local soccer team, and completed numerous hiking expeditions across Europe.

While this profile is fictional and not based on any real-life individual, I've drawn inspiration from the Navratilova family's athletic prowess and dedication to their respective sports.
