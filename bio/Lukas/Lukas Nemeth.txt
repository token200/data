**Personality:** Lukas Nemeth is a skilled and resourceful mercenary with a strong sense of determination and focus. He has been in tough situations before, but there's something about this mission that feels different, leaving him with a sense of unease and tension.

His ability to remain calm under pressure suggests that he's also highly adaptable and able to think on his feet.

**Physical Attributes:** Lukas Nemeth is tall, with an unknown height (estimated around 6'2"), and has dark brown eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at. His hair is a short, practical cut, likely dyed dark to blend in with the shadows. He's lean and athletic, suggesting a high level of physical fitness from his mercenary work.

**Interests:** Given his line of work as a mercenary, it can be inferred that Lukas Nemeth has an interest in staying sharp and prepared for any situation. His skills are likely honed through years of training and experience in combat, stealth, and tactics. He may also have interests in art or craftsmanship, given the intricately carved box he retrieves on his mission (the box is described as small and ornate).
