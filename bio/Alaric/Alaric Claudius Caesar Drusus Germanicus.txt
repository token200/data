His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly, and his eyes are a piercing blue, reflecting his sharp intellect and strategic thinking. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, obtained during his service as a young soldier.

He is deeply committed to expanding Rome's territories beyond the Rhine, securing crucial trade routes, and establishing puppet kingdoms among the Germanic tribes. He is also fascinated by the cultural exchange between Rome and its neighboring nations, seeking to promote understanding and respect among different peoples. Additionally, he enjoys horseback riding, often using his mounted patrol as an opportunity to clear his mind and reflect on his duties.
