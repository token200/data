Here is a summary of Alaric Petrov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Alaric Petrov stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential vulnerability. His dark brown hair is often neatly trimmed, framing a face that is both strong and chiseled.

**Personality:** Alaric Petrov exudes an air of quiet confidence that commands attention without demanding it. As a former Russian spy, he has honed his skills in the art of deception and manipulation, making him a master of subtlety and calculated risk-taking. Despite this tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability beneath the surface - a sense of humor that can catch someone off guard, a deep-seated loyalty to those he cares about.

**Interests:** Alaric Petrov's interests are varied but centered around books, language, and cultural nuances. As the owner of a small bookstore in Paris, he spends his days surrounded by dusty tomes and ancient manuscripts, delighting in the discovery of rare volumes and obscure texts. He is also an avid collector of antiques and historical artifacts, often incorporating them into his bookstore displays.

Outside of work, Alaric Petrov enjoys reading literary classics, sipping absinthe at a Parisian caf√©, and exploring the city's winding streets and alleys in search of hidden gems. His love of languages has also led him to learn several dialects of French and Russian, which he uses to add an air of authenticity to his espionage exploits.

**Other Traits:** Alaric Petrov is an expert manipulator, able to weave intricate webs of deceit and persuasion with ease. However, this skillset comes at a personal cost, leaving him emotionally guarded and wary of trusting others too readily. Despite this, he is deeply committed to those he cares about - Sophia being the first person to pierce his defenses in years.

**Quirks:** Alaric Petrov has a habit of doodling symbols and codes in the margins of his notebooks when deep in thought or under stress. He is also an avid collector of rare books, often using these as conversation starters and icebreakers with strangers (much to Sophia's amusement).
