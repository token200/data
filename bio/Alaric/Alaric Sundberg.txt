**Personality:**
Alaric Sundberg is a brilliant but reclusive astrophysicist, often described as brooding and introspective. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep passion for discovery and a fierce determination to uncover the truth.

**Interests:**
Alaric's primary interest is astrophysics, with a focus on cosmology and the search for extraterrestrial life. He is also fascinated by ancient civilizations and their knowledge of the universe, often delving into obscure texts and seeking out forgotten wisdom. In his free time, Alaric enjoys reading, writing, and playing the guitar (though he rarely performs in public due to his social awkwardness).

Despite his reclusive nature, Alaric has a rich inner life, filled with complex thoughts and emotions. He is haunted by an underlying sense of doubt and uncertainty, which stems from the strange occurrences in his laboratory and the eerie feeling that he is being manipulated by forces beyond his control. This tension drives him to keep pushing forward, even when the road ahead seems uncertain or treacherous.
