Here is a summary of Alaric Ayumi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alaric is a brooding and introspective individual with a strong sense of disillusionment. He has grown disillusioned with The Division's tactics and motives, which has led him to question his own loyalty and purpose. Despite this, he remains determined and resourceful, willing to take on small-time jobs to survive. His sharp instincts and quick thinking have allowed him to navigate the darker corners of the city, but his cynicism and skepticism often make it difficult for him to trust others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair: Dark brown, cut short in a practical style that suits his rugged lifestyle

**Interests:** Alaric's interests are centered around survival and self-reliance. He has a keen eye for strategy and tactics, often using his experience with The Division to his advantage in navigating the city's underworld. He is also drawn to history and ancient cultures, which may be why he is interested in the artifact he retrieves from the warehouse (the ornate box adorned with strange symbols and hieroglyphs). His encounter with the doppelganger sparks a sense of curiosity about his own past and the motivations behind The Division's actions.

It's worth noting that Alaric's experiences have likely led to emotional scars, and he may struggle with feelings of isolation and disconnection. Despite this, he remains driven by a desire for autonomy and a need to forge his own path in life.
