Here is a summary of Alaric "Ric" Handschuh's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ric is a brooding and intense individual driven by a deep sense of purpose and duty. His obsession with hunting the Valois brothers stems from a personal loss: his younger sister Sophia was killed by one of their attacks five years ago. He is fiercely determined to rid the world of the undead scourge that took her life, often putting himself in harm's way to achieve this goal. Despite this, he maintains a sense of calm and focus, even in the face of danger.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a high level of physical fitness from years of intense training and combat.
* Hair: Dark brown, often kept short and neatly trimmed to minimize distractions during his missions.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (likely obtained during one of his many battles).

**Interests:** Ric's primary interest is hunting and dispatching vampires, particularly the infamous Valois brothers. He is also deeply passionate about avenging Sophia's death and honoring her memory through his work. Outside of this, he has a fascination with history, particularly ancient mythology and folklore surrounding the undead. This knowledge informs his strategies and gives him an edge in his battles against supernatural foes.

Additionally, Ric seems to have a penchant for collecting tokens and trinkets from his hunts, often adorning them on his leather jacket as badges of honor. These small mementos serve as reminders of past victories and fuel his determination to continue the fight against the undead.
