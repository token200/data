Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost black in color, which seem to sparkle with curiosity when discussing astronomy or science-related topics. She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small tattoo of the constellations on her left shoulder blade.

**Personality:**
Orsolya is an intensely driven individual with a fierce passion for discovery. Her independence and self-reliance were honed from a young age, when she felt like an outsider in her small town.

Despite the skepticism and discouragement that often accompanies her efforts, Orsolya remains undeterred and focused on her goals.

She is a natural-born problem-solver with an insatiable curiosity about the universe and its many mysteries. Her intellectual arrogance can sometimes be perceived as confidence, but it's rooted in her genuine desire to learn and contribute to the scientific community.

**Interests:**
Orsolya's primary interest lies at the intersection of science and astronomy. She is deeply passionate about understanding the workings of black holes, dark matter, and other astrophysical phenomena that have long been shrouded in mystery. Her work has taken her from theoretical modeling to experimental research, with a particular focus on developing new methods for studying these enigmatic objects.

In her free time, Orsolya enjoys stargazing (much like she did as a child), reading scientific papers and articles on topics related to her field, and engaging in lively debates with colleagues about the latest discoveries and theories. She is also an avid fan of space exploration documentaries and podcasts, which fuel her imagination and inspire new ideas for her research.

Despite her many accomplishments, Orsolya remains humble and grounded, recognizing that there is still much to be learned from the universe. Her dedication to scientific inquiry is a testament to her boundless curiosity and drive to make a lasting impact on human understanding of the cosmos.
