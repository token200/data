Despite her talent and dedication, she can be self-critical and introverted at times, often losing herself in thought and feeling disconnected from the world around her.

**Background:**

Orsolya grew up in a family of artists and musicians, which encouraged her creative expression from a young age. She studied fine art in college, but after completing her degree, she struggled to find her voice and establish herself as an artist. She became increasingly isolated, pouring all her energy into her latest project, "Echoes in the Abyss." The encounter with Sarah marks a turning point for Orsolya, as it reminds her that art can be both personal and shared, leading her to re-evaluate her creative approach and form new connections with others.
