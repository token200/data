**Interests:**
Kalniņš has a deep passion for art, particularly Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. He is an avid collector of rare books on art history and enjoys spending hours studying the works of famous artists. In his free time, he also appreciates classical music and can often be found attending underground concerts in Riga's hidden venues.

**Background:**

He is rumored to have been born in Japan, where he honed his skills as an artist and collector before arriving in Latvia, where he would eventually become the elusive Hashimoto Kalniņš.
