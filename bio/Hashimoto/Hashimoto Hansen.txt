**Personality:** Hashimoto Hansen is an introverted and reclusive individual. He has limited social skills and is often perceived as gruff or aloof by those who don't know him. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a mind that is fiercely intelligent and compassionate. He struggles with the thought of suffering and is deeply empathetic, which makes him more human.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** Hansen is slightly above average height.
- **Eye Color:** His eyes are a deep, piercing blue, which seems almost ethereal due to his intense focus on scientific pursuits.

**Interests:** As a brilliant scientist, Hansen's primary interest lies in his work. He spends most of his time studying and experimenting with various biological phenomena. The intricacies of life at the cellular level captivate him, and he dedicates himself fully to unraveling their secrets.

However, it appears that his interests extend beyond purely scientific pursuits. After being rescued by Maya, Hansen begins to rediscover the joys of living. His interactions with Maya spark a new facet of his personality â€“ one that is warmer, wiser, and more compassionate.
