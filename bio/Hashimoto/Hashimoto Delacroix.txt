However, based on his ability to move quietly and blend into his surroundings, it can be inferred that he may be lean and athletic. His eye color is not explicitly stated, but the narrator describes him as having eyes that "locked onto" Madame Dupont's with a fleeting glance, suggesting that they are perhaps warm or golden in color.
