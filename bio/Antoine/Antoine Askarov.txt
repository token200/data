Here is a summary of Antoine Askarov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Jet-black
* Hair Style: His hair falls across his forehead in a way that seems almost intentional

**Personality:**

Antoine is a man of mystery with a complex past. Few people have seen him smile, but when he does, it's said to be a sight to behold. He has an air of quiet confidence and an unmatched skillset as a former spy for the Russian Federation. Despite his tough exterior, Antoine has a soft spot for books and classical music, which brings out a more introverted side of him.

**Interests:**

* Reading (especially classic literature)
* Listening to classical music
* Sketching and art
* Sipping coffee at quaint cafes on the Seine in Paris

Antoine's love for art and sketching is evident from his observations of Sophia's work. He seems to appreciate her talent and has a deep respect for the city's essence, which he can capture through his sketches. This shared interest could be a point of connection between Antoine and Sophia as they get to know each other better.
