Despite this, he has a warm and welcoming side, especially when it comes to sharing his passion for art.

**Interests:** Antoine's primary interest is art, particularly painting. He spends most of his days lost in thought, surrounded by canvases and half-finished paintings. He is fascinated by colors, shapes, and textures, and his studio reflects this obsession. In addition to his passion for art, Antoine values collaboration and connection with others, as evidenced by his developing friendship with Sophie.
