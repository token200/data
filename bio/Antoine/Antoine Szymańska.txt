Here is a summary of Antoine Szymańska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Antoine Szymańska stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold secrets and stories of their own. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his travels.

**Personality:**
Antoine is an enigmatic and introspective individual, with a dry sense of humor that only reveals itself to those closest to him. Despite his reclusive nature, he is intensely passionate about his art and will go to great lengths to express himself. He is fiercely private, preferring to keep his personal life shrouded in mystery. However, once you gain his trust, Antoine is kind, compassionate, and genuinely concerned with the well-being of those around him.

**Interests:**
Antoine's interests are centered around art, history, philosophy, and the human condition. He is fascinated by the darker corners of life, exploring themes of mortality, loss, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy in his work. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on psychology, sociology, and literature that resonate with his artistic vision. When not creating art, Antoine can be found lost in thought, contemplating the mysteries of existence and the human experience.

In his free time, he enjoys long walks along the Seine River, observing the city's beauty and decay, and exploring the Parisian underworld – a world of hidden corners, secret societies, and mystical energies that inspire his art.
