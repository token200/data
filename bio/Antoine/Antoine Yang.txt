Here is a summary of Antoine Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue with an unusual, almost translucent quality that seems to see right through you
* Skin Tone: Pale, almost translucent complexion that takes on a grayish hue when he's deep in thought or under the fluorescent lights of his laboratory

**Personality:**

Antoine Yang is a complex and enigmatic individual. On one hand, he is a brilliant and driven scientist who has dedicated his life to unlocking the secrets of quantum physics. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely curious, with an insatiable appetite for knowledge that drives him to push the boundaries of human understanding.

On the other hand, Antoine's obsessive focus on his research has taken a toll on his mental health. He is increasingly reclusive and isolated, preferring the company of his data and experiments to that of friends and colleagues. His behavior becomes more erratic and unpredictable as he delves deeper into his work, leading to concerns from those around him about his sanity.

**Interests:**

* Quantum Physics: Antoine's passion for quantum physics drives everything he does. He spends countless hours studying the intricacies of wave-particle duality, entanglement, and superposition.
* Experimentation: Antoine loves nothing more than designing and conducting experiments to test his hypotheses and push the boundaries of human knowledge.
* Coffee: He has a caffeine addiction that borders on obsession, fueling his long working hours and late-night epiphanies.

**Hobbies (pre-madness):**

In his free time, Antoine enjoys reading about philosophy, particularly the works of Kant and Nietzsche, which he sees as having influenced the development of modern physics. He is also a fan of classical music, particularly Mozart and Chopin, whose complex harmonies and rhythms he finds reflect the underlying structure of the universe.

**Hobbies (post-madness):**

As Antoine's grip on reality slips further away, his hobbies become increasingly distorted and surreal. He begins to see patterns in the clouds, hear whispers from the quantum realm, and experience strange visions that blur the lines between reality and fantasy.
