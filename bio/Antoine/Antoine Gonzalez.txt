**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green
- Hair Color: Jet-black
- Skin Tone: Dark brown with a hint of olive undertones

**Personality:**
Antoine is a complex individual with an air of confidence that can sometimes be misleading. On the surface, he exudes a charismatic persona that draws people to him. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply insecure and anxious person who struggles with self-doubt and pressure to perform. He is introspective and vulnerable, often hiding behind his music and stage presence.

**Interests:**
- Music (Jazz, specifically saxophone playing)
- Traveling and experiencing new places
- Good conversation and connection with others
- Writing (unspecified type of writing, but may include poetry or journaling)

Antoine's love for music is deeply rooted in his soul, and he feels a strong sense of connection to the city of New Orleans. He is also drawn to people who can see beyond his public persona and understand him on a deeper level.

It's worth noting that Antoine's full name, "González," suggests a possible Hispanic or Latin American heritage, which could add another layer of complexity to his character.
