* Skin: Her skin appears pale and gaunt, with a subtle hint of weariness around the eyes.

She is fascinated by the human mind's ability to perceive reality and how it can be manipulated or distorted. Her research focuses on uncovering the underlying mechanisms that govern our perceptions, leading her down a rabbit hole of theories about the blurred lines between sanity and madness.
