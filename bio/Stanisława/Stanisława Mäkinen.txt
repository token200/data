**Physical Attributes:**
Stanisława Mäkinen is a 28-year-old woman with an unassuming yet striking presence. She stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) with a slender build, often dressed in understated yet elegant attire that accentuates her unique features.

**Personality:**
Stanisława is an introspective and creative individual with a dry sense of humor. She's a bit of a introvert, preferring the company of her own thoughts and imagination rather than large social gatherings.
