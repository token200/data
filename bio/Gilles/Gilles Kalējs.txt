**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn short and messy
* Build: Muscular, with broad shoulders and a strong physique developed from years of manual labor

**Personality:**

Gilles is a introspective and reserved individual who commands respect due to his exceptional skills and expertise. He is fiercely independent and self-motivated, preferring to learn through hands-on experience rather than formal education. Despite this, he has a deep sense of curiosity and ingenuity, often taking on challenges that others might shy away from. His dry wit and wry smile can be intimidating at first, but reveal a kind and patient person who is genuinely invested in helping others.

**Interests:**

Gilles is passionate about engines, machinery, and problem-solving. He has a natural talent for fixing anything with an engine or mechanical component, and takes great pride in his work. Outside of the garage, he enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's tinkering with his own projects or exploring the surrounding countryside on his motorcycle. He also has a fascination with history, particularly the stories of self-taught inventors and engineers who have pushed the boundaries of innovation. Despite his rugged exterior, Gilles is a romantic at heart, valuing hard work, perseverance, and determination above all else.

**Additional Details:**

Gilles' rural upbringing and village life have instilled in him a strong sense of resourcefulness and adaptability. He has a deep understanding of mechanics and engineering principles, but also knows how to improvise and MacGyver repairs when resources are scarce. Despite his reputation as a skilled mechanic, Gilles is not afraid to admit when he doesn't know something – instead, he takes the time to learn and figure it out on his own terms. This combination of practical knowledge, creativity, and humility has earned him the respect and trust of his clients in Ravenswood.
