As a winemaker, he's meticulous and detail-oriented, always striving for perfection in every bottle. Gilles is also fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. Despite this, he has a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support his loved ones.

When not tending to his vineyard, he enjoys exploring the world's greatest wine regions, learning about new grape varieties, and experimenting with innovative winemaking techniques.
