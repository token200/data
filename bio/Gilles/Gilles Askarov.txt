Here's a summary of Gilles Askarov's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Gilles is a driven and passionate individual who is deeply consumed by his work. He has an unyielding dedication to scientific research and is willing to sacrifice personal relationships and well-being for the sake of discovery. However, this obsession also leads to reclusiveness and a sense of isolation. Beneath his gruff exterior lies a complex and vulnerable person struggling with disillusionment and feelings of emptiness.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown
* Hair Color: Dark blond

Gilles's physical appearance reflects his introspective and reserved nature. His sunken eyes and pale skin suggest a life spent indoors, focused on his work. His rapid finger movements as he types away on his computer add to the image of someone deeply absorbed in their research.

**Interests:** Gilles is primarily interested in genetic research, particularly gene editing, which drives his work and consumes his every waking moment. He has a deep passion for discovery and making groundbreaking contributions to the scientific community. However, beyond his work, Gilles seems to be struggling to find meaning and purpose in life outside of science.

In addition to his professional interests, Gilles's past is also filled with nostalgia for his childhood in the Soviet Union, where he grew up surrounded by the promise of scientific progress. This fondness suggests that he has a sentimental side and values memories from his youth as an important part of his identity.
