Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night, framing her heart-shaped face and high cheekbones. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build that belies her agility and cunning. A small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist is her only visible marker of rebellion.

**Personality:** Benedetta Aber is a complex and enigmatic individual, with a quick wit and sharp tongue that can be both alluring and intimidating. She exudes confidence and poise, often using these traits to mask the turmoil brewing beneath her polished exterior. Despite her sophisticated demeanor, Benedetta has a mischievous streak, a perpetual air of mischief that draws people in while keeping them at arm's length.

**Interests:** As a skilled thief and con artist, Benedetta's interests are centered around the art of deception, always pushing herself to innovate and improve her methods. She is fascinated by the world of high-stakes heists and loves nothing more than outsmarting her marks and evading detection. When not working, Benedetta enjoys attending underground jazz clubs and cabarets, where she can lose herself in the music and observe the city's underbelly.

Outside of these interests, Benedetta has a deep passion for history and art, particularly the works of the French avant-garde movement. She is particularly drawn to the surrealism and expressionism that defined this era, often incorporating elements of these styles into her heists and disguises. This eclectic mix of interests makes her a formidable adversary and an intriguing figure in the shadows of 1920s Paris.

Benedetta's fascination with the enigmatic Comte de Versailles and his priceless gemstone also hints at a deeper desire to uncover hidden secrets and unravel the mysteries that lie beneath the city's surface. As she navigates this complex web of intrigue, Benedetta will have to confront her own demons and make difficult choices about who she can trust â€“ and what lies ahead for her in the shadows.
