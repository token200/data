Despite this, there is a sense of depth and emotion behind his eyes that suggests a complex and possibly troubled individual.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep, piercing green, with an intense intensity that seems to see right through you
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt, framing his angular face and emphasizing his expressive features

**Interests:** Filippo's artistic passion is matched only by his love of mystery and the unknown. He is drawn to the darker aspects of life, exploring themes of loss, grief, and the human psyche in his works.

Outside of art, Filippo has a fondness for classical music and literature, often finding inspiration in the works of philosophers like Nietzsche and Baudelaire. He also has a weakness for old books and manuscripts, collecting them in his studio where they serve as a source of fascination and inspiration.
