Here's a summary of the fictional character Filippo Charpentier:

**Physical Attributes:** Filippo is tall and lean, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). He has dark brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats. His hair is dark and neatly trimmed, often pulled back from his face to reveal a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones.

**Personality:** Filippo is a brooding, intense individual with a deep sense of responsibility and loyalty. He has a strong sense of duty, stemming from the loss of his brother Alessandro five years ago, which drives him to protect those he cares about at all costs. Despite this, he is not one to show emotions openly, preferring to keep his feelings locked away behind a mask of stoicism.

**Interests:** Filippo's primary interest lies in keeping the Medici family and its members safe from harm. He is an expert marksman, swordfighter, and strategist, making him well-suited for his role as head of security. When not on duty, Filippo likely enjoys observing the city and its people from a distance, studying their behavior and patterns to anticipate potential threats.

**Additional Details:** It can be inferred that Filippo is a skilled and highly trained individual, with expertise in hand-to-hand combat, surveillance, and infiltration. He has a keen mind and a talent for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues, making him an invaluable asset to the Medici family's security detail.
