Here's a summary of Filippo Satylganova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Filippo is a introspective and creative individual who struggles to express himself authentically. He is fiercely passionate about his art, but feels constrained by the expectations of others in Moscow's artistic circles. He has a rebellious streak and is drawn to nonconformity, which fuels his desire for self-expression.

**Physical Attributes:** Filippo is a tall person with a lean build (around 6'2" or 188 cm). His eyes are a deep, rich brown that seem to hold a world of emotion. His features are finely etched, with a map of fine lines and creases on his face, hinting at a life spent working late nights and exploring new artistic possibilities.

**Interests:** Filippo is deeply interested in painting, particularly self-portraiture. He spends hours studying the works of other artists, experimenting with different mediums, and pushing the boundaries of what he considers acceptable in his art. He is also drawn to politics and social justice, which fuels his desire for nonconformity and rebellion.

In addition to these interests, Filippo has a strong connection to music, as evidenced by the way the "flickering fluorescent lights above seemed to dance before him" (implying that he might have some background in music or at least appreciate its effects). His passion for art is not just about creating beautiful works of art but also about expressing his innermost thoughts and emotions.

Overall, Filippo's personality, physical attributes, and interests are deeply intertwined. He is a complex individual with a rich emotional landscape, who uses his art as an outlet to explore the world around him and find authenticity in a society that often values conformity over creativity.
