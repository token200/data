Based on the provided story about Jānis Liepiņš, I've created a fictional character profile for János Liepiņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Blue
- Hair Color: Dark Brown
- Body Type: Lean and athletic

**Personality:**
János is a charismatic leader, known for his confidence and determination on the ice. He has a strong sense of responsibility, which extends beyond his hockey career to include being a devoted son and brother. János values close relationships and prioritizes spending time with loved ones. Despite his athletic prowess, he remains humble and grounded, often seeking guidance from those around him.

**Interests:**
- Hockey (obviously!)
- Reading about history and philosophy
- Spending time outdoors, particularly hiking or fishing
- Cooking and trying new recipes
- Attending concerts and festivals

In terms of personality traits that aren't explicitly mentioned in the story, János seems to possess a strong sense of resilience and adaptability. He can pivot from frustration to renewed focus quickly, which serves him well both on and off the ice.

Keep in mind that since János is not a real person, these attributes are purely fictional and created based on the original character's story about Jānis Liepiņš.
