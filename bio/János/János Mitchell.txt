- Height: 5'9" (175 cm) - János is not particularly tall, but his slender build belies his physical strength and determination.
  
- Eye Color: Hazel Brown - His eyes are a warm, earthy brown that hints at his Hungarian heritage. The hazel tone adds depth to his otherwise calm demeanor.

**Interests:** As a historian specializing in Hungarian folklore, János is deeply passionate about uncovering the secrets of the city's rich cultural heritage. Specifically:

- Research and discovery: He finds excitement in tracing down rare texts and deciphering ancient scripts.
