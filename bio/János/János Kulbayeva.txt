Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for János Kulbayeva.

**Physical Attributes:**
János Kulbayeva is a 5'9" (175 cm) tall individual with an athletic build. Her hair is dark brown and usually styled in a sleek, straight manner. Her eyes are a bright shade of hazel, often described as having a mix of green and gold hues.

**Personality:**
János Kulbayeva is a confident and determined person who exudes a sense of quiet strength. She is fiercely independent and has a strong will to succeed, which can sometimes make her come across as assertive or competitive. Despite this, she has a compassionate heart and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. János values honesty and integrity above all else, and she expects the same from others.

**Interests:**
János Kulbayeva is passionate about literature and poetry, often finding inspiration in the works of famous authors like Rumi and Langston Hughes. She enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain her physical and mental well-being. As a history buff, János also has a keen interest in exploring the cultural heritage of various civilizations, particularly those that have been underrepresented or marginalized.

If you'd like, I can start writing a story based on this character profile!
