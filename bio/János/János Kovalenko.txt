**Background:**

János Kovalenko is a brilliant mathematician and physicist who has spent years studying under Dr. Ernő Rubik at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He has always been drawn to the mysteries of the universe, and his mentorship by Rubik has nurtured his passion for these subjects. Despite his impressive intellect, János remains humble and unassuming, preferring to let his work speak for itself.

The cryptic letter from Dr. Rubik sets him on a journey into the hidden symmetries, leading him to uncover secrets that challenge our understanding of mathematics, physics, and philosophy.
