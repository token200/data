Here is a summary of Daniel Jørgensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Daniel Jørgensen is a complex and enigmatic individual with a dry sense of humor. He exudes confidence and intelligence, which earned him a reputation as one of the best private investigators in Copenhagen. However, his neutral expression can sometimes give away a hint of his intense focus on the case at hand. Despite this, he has a deep empathy for those who are lost or searching for answers.

**Physical Attributes:** Daniel is tall, standing around 6'2" (188 cm), which makes him an imposing figure in crowded spaces. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a messy way. His eyes are piercing green, an unnerving quality that can be both captivating and unsettling. He has sharp jawlines and a small nose, giving him a lean yet angular appearance.

**Interests:** Daniel's interests seem to revolve around solving the puzzle of life, particularly when it comes to the mysteries surrounding Emma's disappearance. He is fiercely driven by a desire for justice and truth, often taking on cases that no one else wants to touch. Beyond his work as an investigator, little is known about Daniel's personal life or hobbies. However, given his age (mid-to-late 30s) and experience, it is likely that he enjoys indulging in whiskey and good books when not working.

One other attribute could be that Daniel is extremely intelligent with a strong analytical mind.
