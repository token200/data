Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Daniel Bernard:

**Personality:** Daniel appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of dark alleys and seedy characters, which suggests that he has gained experience and confidence in handling difficult situations. However, his skepticism and questioning nature also indicate that he is not easily swayed by emotional appeals or intuition alone. He seems to be driven by a sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original text does not provide detailed physical descriptions of Daniel Bernard. To fill in these gaps, let's make some assumptions:

* Age: Late 30s/Early 40s
* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue (which seems fitting for a private investigator with a strong sense of justice)

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Daniel's primary interest is solving cases and uncovering the truth. He likely enjoys the intellectual challenge of piecing together seemingly unrelated clues and following leads. Outside of work, he might enjoy activities that allow him to relax and clear his mind, such as reading or taking long walks in nature.

It's worth noting that these details are not explicitly mentioned in the original text, but they can be inferred from Daniel's actions and behavior throughout the story.
