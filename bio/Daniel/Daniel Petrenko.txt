On the surface, he appears stoic and detached, with a dry sense of humor that can be both intimidating and charming. As "Specter," he has honed his skills as a master manipulator, able to blend in seamlessly with his surroundings and extract himself from tight spots with ease. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity, stemming from his troubled past.

**Interests:**
Daniel's interests are varied and eclectic, reflecting his globetrotting career as an operative. He is fascinated by the art of disguise and deception, often incorporating elaborate costumes and personas into his missions.
