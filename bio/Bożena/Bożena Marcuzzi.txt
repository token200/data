Based on the provided story, here's a summary of Bożena Marcuzzi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bożena is an enigmatic figure with a reserved nature, often appearing mysterious to outsiders. However, she possesses a deep understanding of those around her, as evident from her ability to discern the hearts of customers entering her shop. Her unique gift allows her to see beyond surface-level appearances and connect with people on a profound level. As Kasia's bond with Bożena grows, it becomes clear that beneath her reserved exterior lies a compassionate and empathetic individual.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details about Bożena's height or eye color are mentioned in the story. However, based on her piercing green eyes described as "otherworldly," it can be inferred that she has striking, possibly almond-shaped eyes with a distinctive iris hue.

Unfortunately, I don't have information to add to physical attributes beyond her piercing green eyes
