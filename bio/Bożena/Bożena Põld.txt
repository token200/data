Since I couldn't find any information on a person named Bożena Põld, I'll create a fictional character based on your request. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Bożena Põld is a 25-year-old Estonian woman. She stands at about 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build. Her hair is a dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail when she's active. Her eyes are an arresting shade of bright blue, almost cerulean. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:**
Bożena Põld is a free-spirited individual with an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp mind, often finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Despite her independent nature, she has a compassionate heart and will go out of her way to help those in need. Bożena's adventurous spirit is contagious, inspiring those around her to take risks and push beyond their comfort zones.

**Interests:**
Bożena Põld is an avid outdoorswoman, with a deep love for hiking, camping, and exploring the natural world. She's particularly drawn to the unique landscapes of her native Estonia, where she can often be found discovering hidden waterfalls or secret glades. When she's not venturing into the wilderness, Bożena enjoys practicing yoga, playing the violin, and learning new languages (currently fluent in Estonian, Swedish, and basic Finnish).

**Background:**
Bożena Põld is a bit of a nomad at heart, having spent her childhood traveling between different parts of Estonia with her family. This exposure to diverse cultures has instilled in her a sense of adaptability and openness to new experiences. She's currently working as a freelance journalist, using her writing skills to explore the intersection of nature, culture, and community.

I hope this summary provides a solid foundation for your fictional character!
