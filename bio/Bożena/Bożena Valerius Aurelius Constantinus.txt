Here is a summary of the fictional character Bożena Valerius Aurelius Constantinus:

**Physical Attributes:** Bożena stands at 5'8" (172 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a piercing green, a rare trait among the Roman population. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a practical yet stylish braid that keeps it out of her face while she works. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors haggling with customers.

**Personality:** Bożena is a shrewd and intelligent woman, known for her quick wit and sharp mind. She is fiercely independent and resourceful, having grown up in the fast-paced world of commerce. Despite her many successes, she remains humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. Her confidence and assertiveness have earned her the respect of her peers, but also inspire a sense of intimidation in those who underestimate her.

**Interests:** Bożena is passionate about trade, finance, and entrepreneurship. She has an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond Rome, often spending hours poring over maps and reading accounts of exotic goods from distant lands. Her love of learning and adventure drives her to seek out new opportunities and partnerships that expand her business and knowledge.

**Additional Details:** Bożena's parents, both successful traders in their own right, have instilled in her a strong work ethic and strategic thinking from a young age. She has grown up surrounded by the sights, sounds, and smells of commerce, learning everything there was to know about the intricacies of trade and finance. Her name, full with all its Latin titles (Valerius Aurelius Constantinus), reflects her family's noble heritage and her own ambition and determination to succeed in a male-dominated field.

It is worth noting that since I couldn't determine any information about Bożena's face or eyes color other than green from the given short story, some of those details are made up.
