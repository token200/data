Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Janos Errani's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Janos Errani appears to be driven by a sense of curiosity and determination. He is haunted by his family's dark legacy and feels an overwhelming need to understand where it all began. This obsession with the truth is both admirable and unsettling, suggesting that Janos may be introverted and private, preferring to focus on unraveling the mysteries of his past rather than engaging in small talk or social interactions. His willingness to confront his family's dark history head-on indicates a level of courage and resilience.

**Physical Attributes:** According to the story, Janos Errani is 25 years old (no specific height or eye color are mentioned). However, I can create some additional details based on common tropes in fantasy fiction:

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - This height suggests a lean and athletic build, allowing Janos to move easily through the rural town.
* Eye Color: Hazel or Green eyes - These colors convey a sense of mystery and depth, fitting for a character who is both fascinated by his family's dark legacy and driven to uncover the truth.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Janos Errani has a singular focus on unraveling the mysteries surrounding his family's past. This obsession drives him to explore the history of Ravenswood and its connections to the occult. He may also have an interest in researching his family's history, possibly delving into dusty archives and forgotten rituals.

Additionally, Janos Errani may have a fascination with the supernatural or paranormal elements associated with his family's legacy, which could lead him down dark paths as he digs deeper into Ravenswood's secrets.
