Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Janos Kalejs:

**Personality:** Janos Kalejs is known for his cunning and intelligence, making him one of the most elusive operatives in the business. He is a master manipulator with a talent for disguise and deception, able to think on his feet and stay one step ahead of his adversaries.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue

Unfortunately, the short story does not provide any information about Kalejs' physical appearance beyond these details. Based on this brief summary and some artistic license, I have filled in the following additional details:

**Interests:** When not actively working on his espionage schemes, Kalejs is an avid reader of philosophy and literature, particularly the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus. He also enjoys playing the saxophone, a skill he developed during his time in the KGB.

It's worth noting that these physical attributes, interests, and other details are fictional and created based on the inspiration provided by the short story.
