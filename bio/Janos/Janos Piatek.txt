Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Janos Piatek's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Janos Piatek appears to be a complex individual with a troubled past. He is haunted by memories of his time in service and seems to be struggling to come to terms with his experiences. His enigmatic nature and reluctance to discuss his past suggest that he may be introverted, private, and guarded about his personal life. Despite this, Janos Piatek seems to be intelligent and perceptive, as evidenced by his ability to detect Anna's intentions and respond accordingly.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: Janos Piatek is likely around 6 feet tall (183 cm), which was a standard height for Eastern European men in the past.
- Eye Color: His eyes are likely dark brown or almost black, which could be a trait common among individuals from Eastern Europe.
- Build and Appearance: While not explicitly described in the story, Janos Piatek's build and appearance are implied to be rugged and weathered, possibly due to his years of military service.

**Interests:**
Janos Piatek seems to have a quiet and introspective nature, often lost in thought as he reflects on his past. He appears to value solitude and anonymity, preferring to keep to himself rather than engaging with others or seeking external validation. However, it's possible that beneath this façade lies a deep interest in history, politics, or perhaps even art, given the mention of whiskey and the dimly lit café where he meets Anna.

It is also worth noting that Janos Piatek seems to have an affinity for nature, as implied by his observations of the sun dipping below the Vltava River and his later contemplation of the city's labyrinthine streets and alleys. This appreciation for natural beauty might suggest a deeper connection with the world around him, which he may not fully express or acknowledge.
