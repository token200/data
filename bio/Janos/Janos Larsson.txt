**Physical Attributes:**
Janos Larsson stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming presence. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost violet in color, which seems to hold a world of depth and mystery within them.

**Personality:**
Janos is a quiet and reserved individual who has always been more comfortable with his thoughts than with the company of others. As he grew older, this introverted nature only intensified, making him increasingly reclusive. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a complex web of emotions, talents, and principles that drive him to create and inspire those around him. Janos is fiercely independent and principled, willing to sacrifice his own well-being if it means staying true to his art.

**Interests:**
Janos's passions lie in the realm of language and storytelling. He has an insatiable appetite for books, particularly worn and tattered novels that hold secrets and stories within their pages. His love for words is matched only by his dedication to crafting tales that transport listeners to other worlds. When not writing, Janos is often lost in thought, pondering the intricacies of language and its power to shape reality.

Despite his reclusive nature, Janos has a deep appreciation for the world around him, though he may choose to keep it to himself. He is intensely curious about human nature and the complexities that drive people to make choices.
