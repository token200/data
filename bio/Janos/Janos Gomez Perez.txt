Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Janos Gomez Perez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Janos appears to be a reserved and introspective individual, preferring to keep his distance from the world due to the whispers and speculation about his past. He has a quiet confidence and seems to know that he is being watched, which suggests that he may have a sharp intuition or awareness of his surroundings. However, this reserve also indicates that he may struggle with emotional intimacy or connecting with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Janos is described as having rugged features, including a thick patch of stubble on his jawline. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a thousand secrets, and his sharp jawline adds to his intimidating presence. He stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, which contributes to his imposing figure.

**Interests:** As a former spy, Janos's interests may revolve around intelligence gathering, covert operations, and strategic planning. However, due to his years of living in the shadows, he has grown weary of the game and no longer finds fulfillment in this line of work. He now appears to be more interested in observing life from a distance, perhaps finding solace in the quiet streets of the small town where he resides.

It is also worth noting that Janos's past self was once full of fire and determination, suggesting that he may have had a passion for his work or a strong sense of purpose. However, this drive seems to have waned over time, replaced by a sense of detachment and disillusionment with the life of a spy.
