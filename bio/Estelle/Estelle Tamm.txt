Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Estelle Tamm:

**Personality:** Estelle is known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, earning her the nickname "The Snake" among those who know her. However, beneath this gruff exterior lies a creative and sensitive soul. She is introverted and has been discouraged from pursuing artistic pursuits in the past, but with the support of Sophia, she begins to reveal her true self, showcasing a kind and vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair: Dark brown, shoulder-length, and often styled in a practical bob

**Interests:** Estelle's passions lie in writing, particularly literature. She is an avid reader and writer, devouring books on various subjects but always returning to her true love of fiction. Her interest in sewing is more of a means to support herself, rather than a passion. However, when given the opportunity to write again, she finds a renewed sense of purpose and joy.

It's worth noting that Estelle's past experiences have shaped her personality, causing her to hide behind her sharp wit and gruff exterior. Her newfound friendship with Sophia has helped her to break free from these constraints and reveal her true self as a creative and sensitive person.
