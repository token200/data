Here is a summary of Estelle Salvini's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Estelle is a complex and guarded individual with a sharp exterior that hides a deep-seated determination and resilience. Her razor-sharp wit and quick tongue have earned her a reputation as a formidable journalist, but beneath this tough exterior lies a sensitive and vulnerable person. She is fiercely independent and has built walls around herself to protect against the pain of her past.

**Physical Attributes:** Estelle stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. Her dark hair is often pulled back in a tight ponytail, revealing a sharp jawline and full lips that curve into a subtle, enigmatic smile. She has a toned physique from years of walking the streets of Rome as an orphan.

**Interests:** As a renowned journalist, Estelle's primary interest lies in uncovering the truth behind corruption and scandals. Her driving force is to expose those in power who seek to hide secrets and manipulate others for their own gain. However, it appears that this fascination with the truth has also led her to become increasingly obsessed with her own past, searching for answers about her biological parents and the identity of the mysterious figure who revealed them to her.

In addition to her professional pursuits, Estelle likely values independence, self-reliance, and courage above all else. She may also have a deep appreciation for the beauty and history of Rome, given her tumultuous upbringing on its streets.
