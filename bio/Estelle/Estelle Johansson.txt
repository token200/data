**Physical Attributes:** Estelle stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet wiry build. Her hair is a rich, dark blonde color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a piercing blue that seem to see right through you, reflecting a deep intensity and passion. Her features are strong and angular, with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline.

**Personality:** Estelle is a forceful and unapologetic individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is fiercely creative and intensely passionate about her art, often to the point of obsession. Despite her success, she remains humble and grounded, preferring to let her work speak for itself rather than seeking constant validation. Her tough exterior hides a sensitive soul, one that has been shaped by years of struggling with mental health issues and relationship challenges.

**Interests:** Estelle is deeply connected to the natural world, particularly the ocean and its rhythms. She finds inspiration in the way light dances on waves, the sound of seagulls overhead, and the smell of salt air on her skin. Her art reflects this love for nature, with vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes capturing the drama and power of the sea. In addition to painting, Estelle is an avid sailor and hiker, often seeking out new landscapes to explore and draw inspiration from.

**Other interests:** Despite her success as an artist, Estelle has a secret passion for collecting vintage fishing nets, which she displays proudly in her studio. She is also a voracious reader of poetry and philosophy, finding solace in the words of Walt Whitman and Friedrich Nietzsche. Above all, Estelle values freedom and autonomy above all else, often putting her artistic vision ahead of personal relationships or financial security.
