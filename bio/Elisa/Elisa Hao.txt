**Physical Attributes:** Elisa is a woman in her mid-to-late thirties, likely in her 35s given her experience and skills as a detective. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), with an athletic yet slender build that allows her to move easily through crowded spaces. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown, almost black, which seem to bore into those she interrogates or observe. Her dark hair is often pulled back in a ponytail, revealing a pointed chin and sharp jawline.

**Personality:** Elisa is a driven and determined individual with an insatiable curiosity about the unknown. She has a strong sense of justice and is willing to take risks to uncover the truth, even if it means delving into dark and taboo subjects. Her analytical mind and years of experience have honed her skills as a detective, allowing her to piece together seemingly unrelated clues and solve complex cases. Despite her tough exterior, Elisa has a compassionate side, evident in her interactions with people like Kokoro-san, who seems to understand the weight of her investigation.

**Interests:** As a detective specializing in the paranormal and supernatural, Elisa's interests lie at the intersection of science and mystery. She is fascinated by ancient rituals, folklore, and mythology, which often hold secrets to understanding seemingly inexplicable events.

When she's not investigating cases, Elisa enjoys reading about various historical periods, particularly those with a strong spiritual or magical component.

It's worth noting that Elisa's interests extend beyond her professional life. She is also an avid traveler, always seeking new experiences and environments to inform her investigations. Her passion for solving the unsolvable drives her to stay one step ahead of the darkness, as hinted at by Kokoro-san's enigmatic warning: "May your search for the truth bring you peace."
