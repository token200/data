Her confidence and stage presence make her a compelling performer, but she remains humble and connected to her roots.

**Physical Attributes:** Elisa stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with dark brown eyes that sparkle when she performs or creates music. She has long, curly black hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her full-figured frame is toned from years of dancing and performing, but she carries herself with a radiant energy that commands attention.

**Interests:** Elisa's passions include traditional Cuban dance, salsa, jazz, and music production (specifically writing and singing Latin-inspired songs).
