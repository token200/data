Outside of work, Elisa enjoys long walks along the Riga waterfront, sipping coffee at cozy cafes, and losing herself in literature – particularly true crime stories and historical accounts. Her apartment is cluttered with research materials, books, and newspapers, reflecting her dedication to her craft and her constant quest for knowledge.

Despite her success as a journalist, Elisa's personal life is somewhat enigmatic, leaving room for speculation about her past and future ambitions...
