Here is a summary of Elisa Szymanska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elisa is a reclusive and brilliant mathematician with an intense focus on her work. She is obsessive and driven, often to the point of neglecting social relationships and personal interactions. Despite this, she has a deep passion for mathematics that brings her joy and fulfillment. She is independent and true to herself, valuing her alone time over external validation.

**Physical Attributes:** Elisa is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into the equations she studies. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a neat ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose. She has a slender build, but one that belies her intense mental energy.

**Interests:** Elisa's primary interest is mathematics, particularly fractals and ultracomplex numbers. She finds solace in the intricate patterns and relationships between numbers, which she believes hold secrets to understanding the universe. Her work takes her into the realm of theoretical mathematics, where she explores the boundaries of human knowledge. Outside of academia, Elisa has no discernible hobbies or interests beyond her research, preferring to immerse herself in her own world of equations and patterns.

It's worth noting that while Elisa is portrayed as a solitary figure, her passion for mathematics suggests that she may have moments of introspection and self-discovery when working alone.
