Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Elisa Sienkiewicz's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elisa appears to be a introspective and detached individual who has grown accustomed to the fast-paced environment of New York City. She seems to possess a practiced air of reserve, which allows her to navigate the city's rhythms with ease. However, she is also shown to be open-minded and receptive to new ideas, as evidenced by her engaging conversation with Julian about art, politics, and other topics.

**Physical Attributes:** Although the story doesn't provide explicit details on Elisa's physical appearance, we can make some educated guesses based on the context.

Given that she works as a photographer for an arts magazine, it's possible that she values creativity, self-expression, and artistic freedom. Considering these factors, I would imagine Elisa to be someone with:
