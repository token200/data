Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Publius Jansons' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Publius Jansons is an enigmatic figure with a smooth presence. He is a recluse by nature, preferring to keep to himself and maintaining a low profile. Despite his reserved demeanor, he has a curious mind and is drawn to the unknown and the extraordinary. He is highly intelligent and possesses an uncanny ability to sniff out hidden treasures, indicating a keen sense of observation and analysis. Jansons seems to be introverted, but as he interacts with Sophia, he shows a spark of connection, suggesting that he may not be entirely immune to social interactions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Average to below-average height (5'6" or 1.68 m), which allows him to navigate the narrow sewer tunnels with ease.
* Eye Color: Warm, brown eyes with a hint of warmth and depth, possibly reflecting his love for collecting rare and unusual items.
* Hair: A haphazard tangle of brown hair that falls across his face when he's not wearing his wire-rimmed spectacles. His glasses tend to slide down the bridge of his nose, adding to his endearingly awkward appearance.

**Interests:** Publius Jansons is a collector of oddities and peculiar curiosities, with a passion for uncovering hidden treasures in obscure corners of the city. He seems to be particularly drawn to:

* Antiques and rare artifacts
* Cryptic texts and ancient languages
* Taxidermy and other forms of preserved specimens ( possibly indicating an interest in natural history or scientific curiosity)
* Forgotten lore and forgotten civilizations

As his friendship with Sophia deepens, Jansons' interests may expand to include more abstract concepts, such as philosophical discussions and shared explorations of the human experience.
