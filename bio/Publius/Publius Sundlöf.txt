* He has a keen mind, razor-sharp intellect, and an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. This drives his passion for history and detective work.
* Publius is resourceful and independent, having spent years honing his skills as a detective in Stockholm's Old Town. He trusts his instincts more than anyone else's advice.

* As a historian, he has a particular fascination with the lives of women's rights activists, like his great-grandmother, who fought tirelessly for social justice.
* The thrill of the chase is essential to Publius. He enjoys unraveling puzzles and following cryptic clues, which makes him an expert at deduction and analysis.
* Outside of his work, Publius appreciates classical music, particularly the works of Swedish composers like Sibelius and Pääbo.

**Additional Traits:**

* Despite his air of mystery, he is fiercely loyal to Lena and those who have come to trust him.
