**Personality:**
Diocletianus is known for his commanding presence, authority, and unwavering conviction. He possesses an unshakeable sense of self-assurance that inspires both fear and respect in those around him. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into the souls of his enemies, striking a chill down their spines. Despite this intimidating aura, he is intelligent, cunning, and calculating, always thinking several steps ahead of his opponents.

**Interests:**
- Astrology and Mysticism: Diocletianus' fascination with these esoteric arts drives much of his intellectual pursuits. He spends countless hours pouring over ancient texts and seeking out forbidden knowledge to deepen his understanding of the mysteries of the universe.

His journey from relative obscurity to the pinnacle of power in Rome has imbued him with an aura of authority, discipline, and pragmatism that drives his decisions and actions throughout his reign.
