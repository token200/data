Her handlers refer to her as a "natural" when it comes to her skills, suggesting a deep-seated talent for infiltration and elimination. Despite her lethal reputation, there's an air of vulnerability surrounding Elżbieta, a sense that she is haunted by secrets and ghosts from her own past.

**Quirks:** Elżbieta has a tendency to collect small, seemingly insignificant trinkets or tokens from her targets before eliminating them, which she stores in a secret compartment within her jacket. These trinkets serve as reminders of the people she's met and the missions she's completed, imbuing her with a sense of personal satisfaction that drives her forward.

**Overall:** Elżbieta Popov is a complex, enigmatic figure – part ghost, part shadow, part razor-sharp assassin. Her legacy lives on through the whispers of those who've crossed her path, leaving behind an aura of awe and reverence for this elusive, lethal operative known only as "Nightshade".
