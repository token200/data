**Personality:**
Elżbieta is an enigmatic and mysterious individual with a rich history. She has a strong sense of resilience and adaptability, which she inherited from her Polish-Japanese heritage.

- Height: Elżbieta stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), allowing her to tower above the locals in Sakai.

As a translator, Elżbieta is passionate about language and communication. She has a talent for bridging cultural gaps and facilitating understanding between people from different backgrounds. Her work at the community center allows her to engage with the residents of Sakai and learn more about their stories and cultures.
