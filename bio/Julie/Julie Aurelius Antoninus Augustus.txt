**Personality:** Julie is intelligent, determined, and driven. She has a strong sense of curiosity and a passion for discovery, which drives her to explore ancient ruins and uncover hidden secrets. Despite being born into imperial life, she remains humble and unassuming, preferring the company of scholars and fellow adventurers rather than courtiers and nobles. Her name suggests a connection to her adopted heritage, but she appears to be more interested in forging her own path and pursuing knowledge than in claiming power or privilege.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Bright blue with a sharp, piercing quality
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often tied back in a practical braid
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, reflecting her mixed heritage
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of exploring the Roman landscape

**Interests:** Julie's primary interest lies in archaeology, particularly in uncovering hidden temples and artifacts from ancient civilizations. She is fascinated by the stories and legends surrounding these discoveries and spends much of her free time studying, researching, and exploring.

Additional details:

* Education: Well-versed in multiple languages, including Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; studied under prominent scholars in Rome

As she navigates the streets of Rome, Julie exudes a sense of quiet confidence and authority, her piercing blue eyes scanning the crowds with an air of intensity. Her dark brown hair is pulled back into a practical braid, revealing a determined jawline and a resolute expression that speaks to her unwavering commitment to uncovering the secrets of the past.
