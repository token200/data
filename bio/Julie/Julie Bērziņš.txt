Since the character Julie Bērziņš doesn't exist in popular culture, I'll create a fictional character based on your request. Here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Julie Bērziņš is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with an athletic build. She has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail when she's engaging in outdoor activities or working out. Her eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to sparkle with a hint of mischief.

**Personality:**
Julie is an adventurous and free-spirited individual who values independence and self-reliance. She's fiercely intelligent and resourceful, often relying on her wits and quick thinking to navigate challenging situations. Her outgoing personality makes her a natural people person, able to form deep connections with those she meets. Despite her fearless nature, Julie has a compassionate heart and will go out of her way to help others in need.

**Interests:**
Julie's passions include extreme sports like rock climbing, skydiving, and white-water rafting. She's also an avid photographer, capturing breathtaking landscapes and wildlife on her travels. When she's not pushing herself physically, Julie enjoys reading classic literature and exploring the mysteries of science and history. Her love for music is equally strong, with a particular fondness for indie folk and ambient electronic tracks.
