Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Asha Straume's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Asha appears to be a introverted and emotionally guarded individual. She has built walls around herself after her parents' divorce, convincing herself she didn't need anyone else's love or forgiveness. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Asha is also fiercely independent and determined, willing to confront her past and forgive those who have hurt her.

She is also shown to be introspective and emotionally intelligent, as evidenced by her ability to listen to her father's stories and understand his perspective. Her open heart and willingness to hear him out allow her to evolve and see the world in a new light.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Asha's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on her age (likely late teens or early twenties) and physical appearance, it can be inferred that she is around 5'6" to 5'8".
* Eye Color: The color of Asha's eyes is not specified in the story, but based on her Scandinavian heritage, it is likely that her eyes are blue or green.

**Interests:**

Asha seems to value introspection and self-reflection. She appears to be someone who enjoys solitude and quiet contemplation, as evidenced by her feelings of disconnection from the world around her when she returns to Oslo. Her love for nature and the outdoors is also hinted at, as she walks through the deserted streets and appreciates the cool mountain air.

Her interests may also include learning about her family's history and understanding her father's story, as well as exploring new experiences and possibilities (as suggested by the expansion of the world before her as she leaves Oslo).

It's worth noting that Asha is a fictional character, so these attributes are based on the provided short story and may not be exhaustive or definitive.
