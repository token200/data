The physical description is not provided in the original story, but based on Asha's determination and enthusiasm, I have imagined her to be a woman with striking features and an athletic build.

**Interests:** Asha's primary interest is art history, particularly Renaissance-era Italian art. She has spent years studying the works of masters like Botticelli and Titian, and is deeply passionate about uncovering hidden gems and lost masterpieces.

It's worth noting that Asha's interests extend beyond her professional work as a curator at the Uffizi Gallery. She seems to have a deep love for Venice and its culture, which motivates her to explore the city's hidden corners and uncover secrets about the past.
