**Personality:** Filip is an enigmatic person with a mysterious past. He has a strong sense of purpose and conviction, which drives him to create buildings that are not only beautiful but also environmentally friendly.

The "Green Ghost" moniker still lingers in the shadows of his personality, waiting to be unleashed once again.

Despite this, the fire in him never fully extinguished; it just shifted towards a more subtle form of activism, driven by his work and personal convictions.

**Quirks:** Filip still has a habit of carrying small notebooks with scribbled notes on various design concepts, leftover from his activist days when he'd jot down slogans or ideas for protests. This quirk is a testament to the lasting impact of his past experiences on his present self.
