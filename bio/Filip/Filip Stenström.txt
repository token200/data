Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Filip Stenstr√∂m:

**Personality:** Filip is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for themselves. He is practical, reserved, and resourceful, honed from years of experience as a soldier. Despite this, he has a strong sense of loyalty and duty, particularly towards his family members. As the story progresses, Filip's resolve hardens, and he becomes increasingly determined and self-reliant.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark blue
- Hair Color: Brown, short, and neatly trimmed

Additional physical details could be added, such as a scar or two, to give Filip a more rugged appearance that reflects his military background. His build is likely athletic and toned from years of manual labor as a carpenter.

**Interests:** Although the story doesn't delve deeply into Filip's personal interests outside of work and soldiering, it can be inferred that he values his independence and has a sense of purpose derived from his work as a carpenter. This suggests a practical and hands-on approach to life, rather than a focus on leisure activities or social pursuits.

Filip is also portrayed as being drawn into the world of espionage by a sense of loyalty and duty towards his brother Jakob, indicating that he values family above all else. As the story progresses, Filip's resolve becomes more focused on uncovering the truth about his brother's situation rather than pursuing personal interests or desires.
