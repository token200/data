Based on the inspiration provided by the short story about Ursula Dumas, I've created a fictional character profile for her:

**Name:** Ursula Dumas

**Age:** Late 30s/Early 40s

**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)

**Eye Color:** Dark brown with a hint of golden brown, resembling a warm, hazel-like color.

**Physical Attributes:** Ursula has long, dark hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. She often wears her hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail or a low bun, accentuating her determined jawline and striking facial structure.

**Personality:** Ursula is known for her razor-sharp wit, confidence, and assertive demeanor, which commands respect from colleagues and adversaries alike. Her sharp tongue can be intimidating, but it's also a defense mechanism that helps her navigate the cutthroat world of law. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and will fiercely fight for those who are wrongly accused or marginalized.

**Interests:** Ursula is an avid reader, devouring books on history, politics, and law. She's particularly interested in social justice and human rights cases. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga, playing tennis, and exploring the city's art scene.

**Background:** Ursula comes from a humble background, having grown up in a working-class family that valued education and determination above all else. Her parents were high school teachers who instilled in her the importance of hard work and empathy for others. This upbringing has shaped her into a passionate advocate for social justice and a fierce competitor in the courtroom.

**Goals:** Ursula's ultimate goal is to become a leading voice in human rights law, using her skills and reputation to protect marginalized communities and fight against systemic injustices.

This fictional character profile captures the essence of the original story's protagonist, with some additional details to flesh out her personality, interests, and background.
