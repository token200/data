Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Ursula Gupta:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep Brown
- Hair Color: Dark Brown, often styled in a chic bob that frames her sharp features
- Skin Tone: Olive with a warm golden undertone, reflecting her Indian heritage

**Personality:**
Ursula 'Ruth' Gupta is known for her confidence, intelligence, and quick wit. Her sharp tongue can sometimes get her into trouble, but it also serves as a defense mechanism to mask her vulnerable side. She is fiercely determined and unyielding in pursuit of truth, often taking calculated risks that put her at odds with those in power.

Her determination and tenacity have earned her the respect of her colleagues, who admire her unwavering commitment to her work. Despite the cutthroat nature of investigative journalism, Ursula remains passionate about uncovering the stories that need to be told, even if it means putting herself in harm's way.

**Interests:**
Ursula has a deep love for words and language, often spending her free time reading and writing fiction. She is an avid traveler and enjoys exploring new cultures and meeting people from different walks of life.

Her fascination with the world of business and finance drives her to uncover the truth behind high-stakes embezzlement scandals, making her a master investigator in her field. When not working on a story, Ursula can be found sipping chai at a local café or practicing yoga to unwind after a long day of chasing leads.

Overall, Ursula 'Ruth' Gupta is a force to be reckoned with – a driven and fearless journalist who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth.
