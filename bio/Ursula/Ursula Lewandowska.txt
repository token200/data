Here's a summary of Ursula Lewandowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ursula stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build. Her dark brown hair is typically styled in a sleek, polished manner, often pulled back to reveal her sharp features. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to bore into those she meets. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Ursula is a complex and multifaceted individual with a tough exterior that hides a vulnerable soul. As a ruthless investment banker, she is driven by ambition and a desire for success. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a hopeless romantic who longs for connection and meaning in her life. She is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or intimidating to those who don't know her. Despite this, Ursula has a dry sense of humor and a quick wit that she uses to deflect attention and protect herself from getting too close to others.

**Interests:**
Ursula's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting her high-stakes finance background and her love of travel and adventure. In her free time, she enjoys:

* Reading classic literature and philosophy
* Exploring new cities and trying exotic foods
* Practicing yoga and meditation to calm her mind and relax her muscles
* Collecting rare art pieces and attending exclusive gallery openings
* Playing the piano, which serves as a creative outlet for her emotions

As Ursula navigates her newfound love with Julian, she is rediscovering herself and exploring new passions and interests that bring her joy and fulfillment.
