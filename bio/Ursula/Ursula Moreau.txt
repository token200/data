Ursula is deeply introspective, often losing herself in the world of her own creation.

Despite this, she remains remarkably self-aware, able to navigate the complexities of her own psyche with remarkable ease.

**Interests:**

Ursula has always been drawn to the darker corners of life, exploring themes of identity, mortality, and the human condition in her art. Her interests lie at the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and the surreal, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur.

Music plays a significant role in Ursula's life, with her favorite composers being Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. Their atonal, expressionist works resonate deeply with her artistic vision, providing the perfect soundtrack for her innermost thoughts and emotions.

Ursula is also an avid traveler, drawn to places where the veil between reality and the unknown is thin. Her art studio, nestled in a quiet corner of Berlin's Kreuzberg district, serves as a constant source of inspiration, surrounded by half-finished canvases, sketches, and artifacts from her many journeys.

Despite her success, Ursula remains committed to pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms with each new piece she creates. Her work is a testament to the power of art to explore the human condition, leaving an indelible mark on those who experience it.
