Here's a summary of the fictional character Ursula Palmas:

**Physical Attributes:** Ursula Palmas stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet toned build. Her hair is a dark brown color that falls just above her shoulders, often pulled back into a sleek ponytail. Her eyes are an intense shade of hazel, with a piercing gaze that misses nothing. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, a souvenir from a past case.

**Personality:** Ursula Palmas is a highly intelligent and resourceful individual who excels as a private investigator. She's fiercely independent, having grown up on the streets of her neighborhood, where she learned to rely only on herself. Her sharp instincts and analytical mind have made her one of the best in the business. Despite her tough exterior, Ursula has a compassionate side, driven by a strong sense of justice.

**Interests:** Outside of her work as a private investigator, Ursula Palmas enjoys reading classic literature, particularly the works of Agatha Christie, and practicing yoga to relax. She's an avid traveler, having visited many parts of the world in search of new cases or to unwind. In her free time, she's also an accomplished cook and loves experimenting with new recipes.

**Additional Details:** Ursula Palmas has a distinctive scar above her left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which she obtained during a particularly rough case a few years ago. She's never married, preferring the solitude of her work to the challenges of relationships. Despite this, she has a close-knit group of friends who support her through thick and thin.

With these details, we can imagine Ursula Palmas as a complex and intriguing character, driven by both logic and intuition, with a rich inner life that's waiting to be explored further.
