Here is a summary of the fictional character Ursula Wozniak:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ursula Wozniak is a tall and slender woman, standing at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet reserved build. Her dark brown eyes are often lost behind thick-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, giving her a studious and intelligent appearance.

**Personality:**
Ursula is a brilliant and introverted astrophysicist who is driven by her passion for understanding the mysteries of dark matter. She is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a deep sense of curiosity and determination. Despite her success, Ursula remains humble and grounded, preferring to focus on her work rather than seeking to bask in the attention of others.

**Interests:**
Ursula's primary interest is, of course, astrophysics and the study of dark matter. She is fascinated by the unseen forces that shape our universe and spends most of her waking hours pouring over data, conducting research, and experimenting with new theories. Outside of her work, Ursula enjoys long walks in the countryside, reading classic science fiction novels, and practicing yoga to maintain a sense of balance and focus.

**Additional Traits:**
Ursula has a dry sense of humor and can be quite sarcastic when faced with bureaucratic red tape or academic politics. She is fiercely loyal to her colleagues and will go to great lengths to support and protect those she cares about. Despite her obsessive nature, Ursula has a deep love for the beauty and wonder of the universe, and her discovery of the dark matter particle is driven by a sense of awe and curiosity rather than personal ambition.

Overall, Ursula Wozniak is a complex and intriguing character whose intellect, determination, and passion drive her to make groundbreaking discoveries that will change the face of science forever.
