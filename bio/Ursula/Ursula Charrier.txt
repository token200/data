**Personality:**

Ursula is an enigmatic and complex soul with a deep sense of mystery. Her piercing green eyes seem to hold secrets that only she knows, and her reserved nature makes it difficult for others to penetrate the layers of her personality. Despite this, she possesses a fierce determination and a drive to uncover the truth about her past and her connection to the mystical realm.

She is a solitary figure who has spent years honing her skills in the dark arts, but beneath the fa√ßade of power lies a heart still shattered by loss. Her relationships are often intense and fleeting, as she struggles to connect with others on an emotional level. However, those who do manage to gain her trust will be rewarded with unwavering loyalty and a deep sense of devotion.

**Interests:**

* Magic and the mystical realm
* History and ancient lore

* Solitude and self-discovery

Ursula's interests are deeply rooted in her desire to understand the mysteries of the universe and her place within it. She is drawn to the dark arts as a means of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, but this fascination has also led her down a path of isolation and loneliness.

Her love of poetry, particularly the works of Leo, is a poignant reminder of the love she lost, and the longing that still burns within her for a connection with someone who understands her. Despite her tough exterior, Ursula's interests reveal a deep sense of vulnerability and a desire to find meaning in a world that often seems devoid of answers.
