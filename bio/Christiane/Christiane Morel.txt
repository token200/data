Based on the short story, here is a summary of Christiane Morel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Christiane is a passionate and creative individual who values authenticity and originality. She is particular about showcasing her work in exhibitions that align with her artistic vision. This attention to detail suggests that she is meticulous and dedicated to her craft. Additionally, Christiane's pride and sense of accomplishment when receiving positive feedback from others (as seen when Emma compliments her piece "Euphoria") indicate that she is confident and appreciative of her own talents.

However, the text does not provide much information about Christiane's personality beyond these glimpses. She may be introverted or prefer to let her art speak for itself, rather than being overly outgoing or seeking attention.

**Physical Attributes:**

Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide specific details about Christiane's physical appearance, but we can make some educated guesses based on the context:

* Height: Given that she is able to navigate a crowded room with ease and stand out among the other guests, it's possible that Christiane is around 5'8" (173 cm) or taller.
* Eye Color: The story mentions Emma approaching her side, but we don't see Christiane's face in close-up. However, considering the dimly lit atmosphere of the art gallery and the artist's introspective nature, it's likely that Christiane has darker-colored eyes (perhaps brown or green).

As a renowned abstract expressionist artist, Christiane is deeply passionate about creating innovative and thought-provoking art pieces. Her interests likely revolve around:

* Painting and visual art
* Abstract expressionism and modern art movements
* Collaboration and networking with fellow artists
* Pushing boundaries and experimenting with new techniques and mediums
* Celebrating creativity and inspiration in all its forms

Overall, Christiane appears to be a driven and creative individual who is deeply invested in her artistic pursuits.
