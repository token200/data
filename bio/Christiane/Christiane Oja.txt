Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I have created a new character profile for Christiane Oja:

**Physical Attributes:**
Christiane Oja is a 25-year-old woman with an ethereal presence. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build, allowing her to move with fluidity and agility. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost black in color, but with hints of purple undertones that seem to sparkle like stars on a clear night. Her long, raven-black hair falls down her back in loose waves, often framing her heart-shaped face and high cheekbones.

**Personality:**
Christiane is an enigmatic individual with an air of mystery surrounding her. She exudes an aura of quiet determination and resilience, born from years of navigating the unknown. Her eyes hold a deep intensity, as if they are constantly searching for something just beyond the horizon. Christiane is fiercely independent and resourceful, able to think on her feet and adapt to situations with ease. Despite this, she has a compassionate heart and is drawn to those in need, making her a natural ally and friend.

**Interests:**
Christiane's interests revolve around the occult, mysticism, and the study of ancient knowledge. She is particularly fascinated by alchemy, astrology, and the esoteric arts, often devouring books on these subjects in secret. Her love for learning drives her to seek out rare and forbidden texts, such as grimoires like the one she discovered in the "Curios and Antiques" shop. Christiane is also drawn to nature, finding solace in the mysteries of the universe and the secrets hidden within the earth.

**Additional Details:**
Christiane Oja is an orphan who grew up on the streets, surviving by her wits and resourcefulness. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, symbolizing her ability to navigate the shadows and confront her fears. Her eyes seem to hold a deep sorrow, hinting at a troubled past that she keeps hidden from those around her. Despite this, Christiane is determined to unlock her full potential and become a force for transformation in the world.

With these attributes, Christiane Oja is poised to embark on a journey of self-discovery and transformation, armed with ancient knowledge and a fierce determination to unlock her true potential.
