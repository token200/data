Based on the inspiration from Tsui Hark's 1986 film "A Chinese Ghost Story," I have created a fictional character profile for Christiane Tzu-chi:

**Physical Attributes:**

Christiane Tzu-chi is an introverted and creative individual who finds solace in the world of art. He is deeply empathetic and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to help those in need. As an amateur actor, Christiane has a flair for drama and can think on his feet, often using his wit to navigate complex situations. Despite his artistic nature, he possesses a rugged resilience, honed from years of working as a messenger.

**Interests:**

Christiane Tzu-chi is passionate about:

1. **Theater**: He dreams of becoming a professional actor one day, pouring his heart into performances that bring characters to life.
