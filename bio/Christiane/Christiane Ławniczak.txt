**Personality:** Christiane is described as brilliant, resourceful, and driven by an insatiable curiosity about the human brain. She is fiercely independent and determined, willing to push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom in her pursuit of knowledge. However, she also appears to be introverted and reclusive, struggling with the consequences of delving too deep into the mysteries of the mind.

**Physical Attributes:** Christiane's physical appearance is not extensively detailed in the story, but based on the setting of Berlin and the fact that she works at a renowned research institute, it can be inferred that she may have a relatively formal or professional demeanor. Assuming she dresses neatly and conservatively for work, her height could be around 5'6" to 5'8" (168 cm - 173 cm), which is slightly below average in Eastern European countries where Poland is located.
