Here is a summary of Agathe Petrovich's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Agathe is a romantic at heart, with a deep love for music and a strong emotional connection to her past. She is introspective and nostalgic, often getting lost in memories of her childhood and mother's guidance. Despite being forced to put her dreams on hold, she retains a sense of resilience and determination.

**Physical Attributes:** Agathe stands approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an unassuming presence that belies her inner depth. Her eyes are a piercing blue, a trait passed down from her mother's side of the family. Her hair is dark brown and often styled in loose waves that frame her heart-shaped face.

**Interests:** Agathe's primary interest lies in music, particularly classical piano. She was classically trained by her mother and spent countless hours practicing and perfecting her craft. The piano holds a special place in her life, serving as both a source of comfort and a reminder of the sacrifices she made to follow her dreams.

Her other interests include reading (particularly literature and poetry) and exploring old, forgotten places. On nights like this, when she finds herself alone with only her thoughts for company, Agathe often retreats into the world of music, where she can escape the hardships of her present life.

It's worth noting that while Agathe is not an active pianist anymore due to physical limitations and responsibilities in adulthood, playing brings her immense joy, nostalgia, and solace.
