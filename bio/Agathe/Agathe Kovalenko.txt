Her hair is dark brown, possibly shoulder-length, and is often pulled back into a neat ponytail. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a hint of sadness.

**Personality:**
Agathe is an intelligent and driven individual, with a strong passion for archaeology and discovery. She is intensely focused on her work, often to the point of neglecting her personal life. This has led to feelings of monotony, disillusionment, and frustration, causing her to question her own motivations and drive. Despite this, she remains determined and resilient, with a hidden vulnerability that she struggles to express.

Agathe's primary interest is archaeology, specifically the ancient civilizations that once thrived along the Volga River. She is intensely curious about the past and spends countless hours studying artifacts, texts, and other historical records in an effort to piece together the stories of long-lost cultures. Her work has become her identity, and she feels a strong sense of responsibility to uncover the truth about these ancient societies.

In addition to her professional interests, Agathe appears to enjoy quiet, introspective activities such as sipping tea or staring out the window on rainy evenings. She values her independence and prefers to keep her personal life separate from her work, which may contribute to feelings of disconnection and isolation.

It's worth noting that Agathe seems to be struggling with a sense of purpose and identity outside of her professional life, particularly in light of her colleagues' jokes about "Kovalenko-itis." This suggests that she is someone who values her autonomy and independence, but also struggles with vulnerability and openness.
