Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Agathe Kalni≈Üa:

**Physical Attributes:**
Agathe stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her bright blue eyes are her most striking feature, sparkling with an infectious enthusiasm that draws people to her. Her curly brown hair often falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face and full lips. She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, adding a playful touch to her features.

**Personality:**
Agathe is a free-spirited individual with an irrepressible joie de vivre. Her adventurous nature and zest for life make her a magnet for new experiences and relationships. She's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging traditional norms and embracing the unconventional path. Agathe has a compassionate heart, always willing to lend a listening ear or offer words of encouragement to those around her.

**Interests:**
Agathe is an artistic soul, with painting being her greatest passion. Her love for art knows no bounds, and she spends hours exploring the city's hidden gems, capturing their beauty on canvas. She's particularly fascinated by Latvian culture, history, and folklore, often incorporating these themes into her artwork. When not painting, Agathe can be found wandering through parks, gardens, or along the Riga canals, observing the intricate details of nature. Her creative energy is contagious, inspiring those around her to explore their own artistic side.

**Additional Traits:**
Agathe has an innate curiosity and love for learning, often devouring books on art history, philosophy, and literature. She's a skilled listener with a talent for storytelling, weaving tales that capture the essence of Latvia's rich heritage. Her whimsical nature makes her a creative problem solver, able to approach challenges from unique angles.

With this character profile, I've endeavored to capture Agathe's free-spirited essence, artistic talents, and love for Latvia's culture and history.
