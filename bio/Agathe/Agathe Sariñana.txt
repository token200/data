**Physical Attributes:**
Agathe is likely around 5'6" (168 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in loose, effortless waves that frame her heart-shaped face.

Agathe is a free-spirited artist who embodies the essence of the eclectic city she calls home. She's a hopeless romantic, drawn to anything that speaks to her soul – music, dance, color, texture, or smell. Her creativity knows no bounds, and she's always exploring new ways to express herself. Agathe is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the expectations of those around her. Despite this, she has a soft spot for underdogs and outsiders, which draws her to Mateo and others like him.

**Interests:**
Agathe's interests are deeply rooted in her love of art, music, dance, and culture. She's an avid salsa and flamenco dancer, with a deep appreciation for traditional Mexican music and dance.

Agathe is also fascinated by the colorful textiles and fragrances that dot the city, often incorporating them into her art or using them as a source of inspiration.

In addition to these specific interests, Agathe has a broad appreciation for life itself – she loves watching street performers, visiting markets, and taking long walks through the winding alleys of the city. Her passion for connection and community is at the heart of everything she does, and her relationships with Mateo and others are just one example of how art can bring people together in meaningful ways.
