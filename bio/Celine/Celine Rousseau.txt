**Personality:** Celine is fiercely independent, strong-willed, and determined. She has a rebellious spirit, reminiscent of Pierre Dumont's past as a young artist. Her unapologetic approach to art has earned her a reputation among her colleagues, who admire her tenacity and commitment to her craft. Despite her success, she remains humble and grateful for the opportunities she's had, particularly Pierre's mentorship.

**Physical Attributes:** Celine Rousseau is of average height, standing at around 5'7" (170 cm). Her eye color is a deep shade of brown that seems almost velvety in its intensity. Her hair is long, dark, and luscious, often styled in loose waves that cascade down her back. Her features are delicate yet striking, with high cheekbones and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of dedication to her art.

**Interests:** Celine's passion for art is all-consuming, driving her every waking moment. She is an accomplished painter and sculptor in her own right, with a unique style that blends traditional techniques with modern themes. Her interests also include:

* Learning new artistic mediums and techniques
* Exploring different styles and movements in the art world
* Collaborating with other artists to create innovative pieces
* Attending gallery openings and exhibitions to stay up-to-date on the latest trends

Celine is also deeply interested in supporting emerging artists and giving back to her community. She uses her platform to promote art education and provide opportunities for underrepresented artists to showcase their work.

As a result of Pierre's influence, Celine has become particularly fascinated with the intersection of art and technology. She sees the potential for digital tools to enhance artistic expression and is always on the lookout for innovative ways to incorporate them into her own practice.
