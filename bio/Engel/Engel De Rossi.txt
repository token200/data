**Physical Attributes:**
Engel De Rossi stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a manner that frames his face. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to sparkle with intensity when he plays the piano. He has a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him a striking presence.

**Personality:**
Engel De Rossi is a passionate and driven individual who pours his heart and soul into his music. He is deeply emotional and intuitive, often tapping into his own personal experiences to create art that resonates with others. Despite facing high expectations from his family and the pressure of living up to them, Engel has developed a strong sense of self and independence. He is fiercely determined and focused on his craft, but also has a vulnerable side that he only reveals to those closest to him.

**Interests:**
Engel De Rossi's primary interests are music (of course!), as well as literature and philosophy. He finds inspiration in the works of great authors like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and often incorporates themes from their writing into his compositions. Engel is also deeply interested in psychology and human behavior, which he believes informs much of his artistic expression. When not composing or performing, Engel enjoys taking long walks in nature, reading poetry, and exploring the city's underground art scene.

It's worth noting that while Sophia is mentioned as a character who believes in Engel's unique gift, she is not explicitly included in this summary as her physical attributes or interests are not described in detail.
