Here is a summary of Engel Lace's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Engel Lace is a recluse who values solitude and quiet contemplation. However, beneath her reserved exterior, she is a deeply emotional and empathetic person with a rich inner life. She is a poet and a weaver of words, able to craft intricate and beautiful language that reveals hidden meanings. Engel is also a deep thinker, often lost in her own thoughts and reflections.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Engel stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to hold secrets and depths that few have ever seen.
* Hair: Engel's hair is a wild tangle of curly brown locks that often falls in loose waves down her back.

**Interests:** As a poet and writer, Engel's primary interest is the art of language and the way it can be used to evoke emotions and create worlds. She also has a deep love for nature, particularly flowers, which she tends to with care and dedication. In addition to writing and gardening, Engel enjoys journaling, stargazing, and walking in the woods.

It's worth noting that Engel is not a master of any specific skill or talent outside of her writing, but this lack of confidence actually fuels her creativity and passion for words. She has a unique ability to tap into the world around her and express it in her own distinctive voice.

Finnley Swift's arrival sets off a chain reaction that awakens Engel from her self-imposed isolation and encourages her to explore new depths of herself, but even as she finds joy and companionship with Finnley, she remains a private person at heart.
