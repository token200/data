Here is a summary of Engel Nowakowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Engel stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet rugged build, honed from his years as a soldier. His short brown hair often flees from under his baseball cap, revealing a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep sadness. Despite his rugged appearance, there is an air of quiet intensity about him.

**Personality:** Engel is a man of few words, but when he speaks, people listen. He exudes a sense of quiet confidence and authority, born from years of discipline and service in the military. However, beneath this exterior lies a complex and emotional individual who wears his heart on his sleeve – even if it's hidden behind a mask of reserve. Engel is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Interests:** In his free time, Engel enjoys playing the guitar, finding solace in the melodies and chords that evoke memories of happier times. He is also passionate about mechanics, working on cars with precision and care to restore them to their former glory. When he's not tinkering with engines or strumming his guitar, Engel loves exploring the rolling hills and forests surrounding his small town, finding peace and tranquility in nature.

Engel's love for music, repair work, and the natural world serve as a testament to his well-rounded personality – one that is both rough-hewn and deeply human.
