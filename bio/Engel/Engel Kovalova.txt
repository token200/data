**Personality:** Engel is a determined and resourceful individual who has been driven by her sister's death in Budapest. She appears to be fiercely independent and self-reliant, having been on the run for weeks before arriving in Ravenswood. However, she also seems to have a strong sense of loyalty and justice, as evident when she decides to work with Lena from the underground resistance movement. Engel's fear and anxiety are palpable, especially in her initial encounter with Lena, but she manages to compose herself and accept help.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Engel is likely around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, as described by the narrative that uses this height for another character.
* Eye Color: The story mentions that Lena has piercing green eyes. Assuming Engel is not Lena, Engel's eye color is unknown but could be something like hazel or brown to contrast with Lena's bright green.

**Interests:** As a victim of her sister's mysterious death and an outsider in Ravenswood, Engel's primary interests seem to revolve around uncovering the truth about Natalia's murder and understanding her family's past. She is driven by a desire for justice and answers, which sets her on a path of discovery that may lead to danger but also potentially liberates her from her current state of uncertainty.
