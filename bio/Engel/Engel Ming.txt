Here is a summary of Engel Ming's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Engel Ming stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown and often falls across his forehead in a messy manner, framing his expressive eyes that sparkle like stars on clear nights. His eye color is an unsettling shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which adds to the mystique surrounding him.

**Personality:** Engel Ming is an introspective individual with a strong desire for spiritual growth and self-discovery. He possesses a calm demeanor that belies his intense curiosity about the mysteries of existence. His humility and willingness to learn make him approachable and empathetic towards others, yet he remains fiercely independent in his pursuit of truth.

**Interests:** Engel Ming is deeply passionate about Winged Sufism, which has become the core of his spiritual practice. He finds solace in the ancient text that introduced him to this concept, spending countless hours studying its teachings and reflecting on their significance. His interests extend beyond meditation and spirituality, however. He is also an avid reader of philosophy, psychology, and cosmology, often delving into the works of Eastern thinkers and mystics.

Engel Ming's love for exploration and discovery extends beyond his spiritual pursuits as well. When not in his meditation room or studying, he can be found wandering through nature reserves or stargazing on clear nights, lost in thought and contemplation.
