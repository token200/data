Here is a summary of Engel Nowak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Engel is a brilliant, yet introverted and reclusive physicist. She is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-motivation, which can sometimes lead to neglecting those who care about her most. Despite her reserved nature, she is intensely curious and passionate about unlocking the secrets of dark matter. Her experiences have made her introspective and self-analytical, with a tendency to overthink and doubt herself.

**Physical Attributes:** Engel is a slender woman in her mid-30s, standing at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, which seem almost otherworldly in the right light. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones. She has a small tattoo of an equation on her left wrist, symbolizing her fascination with physics.

**Interests:** Engel's primary interest is understanding the mysteries of dark matter, which has consumed most of her adult life. Her work as a physicist is deeply personal and driven by a sense of curiosity and wonder. Outside of her research, she enjoys reading theoretical physics texts and attending lectures on cosmology. In her free time, she often finds herself daydreaming about abstract concepts and pondering the fundamental nature of reality.

**Background:** Engel's childhood was marked by a strong encouragement from her parents to pursue a more "stable" career path, which may have contributed to her introverted nature and reclusive tendencies. As an adult, she has largely withdrawn from social interactions, preferring the company of books and equations to people. Despite this, there is a sense that Engel is not entirely disconnected from others – she is attuned to the energies around her and can sense when someone genuinely understands or resonates with her.

**Intrigue:** Given the enigmatic introduction by the stranger at the café, it seems that Engel's life may be about to take an unexpected turn. The arrival of this mysterious individual has awakened a spark within her, suggesting that there is more to her story – and possibly even her identity – than she initially thought.
