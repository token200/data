Here is a summary of Engel Esther's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Engel Esther stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an ethereal beauty that belies the darkness within her. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which seem to pierce through those she meets. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall, framing her heart-shaped face and highlighting her sharp features. Engel's skin has a pale, almost luminous quality, as if it is infused with an otherworldly glow.

**Personality:** Engel Esther is enigmatic and private, preferring to keep to herself and avoid drawing attention to herself. Despite her striking appearance, there is something unsettling about her that makes people feel like they are standing on the edge of a precipice. As she navigates the complexities of her powers and family's dark past, Engel becomes increasingly introverted and guarded, making it difficult for others to get close to her.

**Interests:** Engel Esther has an intense fascination with ancient magic, which was passed down to her by her reclusive grandmother. She spends hours studying and practicing various forms of magical arts, seeking to understand the intricacies of reality manipulation. Her research often leads her down dark and obscure paths, exploring the intersection of myth, folklore, and forbidden knowledge.

As she delves deeper into The Order's mysteries, Engel becomes increasingly enthralled with unraveling the secrets of her family's history and the origins of her powers. She is driven by a sense of curiosity and determination, often putting herself at risk to uncover the truth about her past and her place in the world.

Engel's interests also extend to understanding the human condition and the nature of good and evil. Her experiences have taught her that nothing is ever as simple as it seems, and she is constantly seeking to reconcile her own darkness with a desire for redemption and self-discovery.
