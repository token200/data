Here is a summary of Engel Volkov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Engel Volkov is a determined and fiercely independent journalist with a strong sense of justice. She is driven by a desire to uncover the truth, no matter how complex or difficult it may be. Her years of investigating darker corners of German history have made her resourceful, analytical, and sometimes ruthless in her pursuit of leads. Despite this, she has a deep empathy for those affected by her research and is willing to risk herself to protect others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those she interviews
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a stylish bob
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned from spending years traveling and working in different countries

**Interests:** Engel Volkov is passionate about investigative journalism, particularly when it comes to uncovering historical secrets and shedding light on forgotten stories. She has a deep fascination with her great-uncle's wartime experiences and the secrets he kept hidden behind his enigmatic smile. When not researching or writing, she enjoys reading classic novels (especially those of the spy thriller genre), sipping coffee in quiet cafes, and exploring the streets of Berlin.

It is worth noting that Engel Volkov's physical attributes were somewhat inferred from her actions and behavior in the short story, but I have tried to create a well-rounded character profile based on the information provided.
