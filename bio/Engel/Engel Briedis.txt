**Physical Attributes:**
Engel Briedis stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet rugged build, honed from years of combat and physical labor. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential danger. A scattering of scars across his cheeks and forehead testifies to his tumultuous past.

**Personality:**
Engel Briedis is a complex individual with a mix of rough edges and vulnerabilities. On the surface, he presents himself as a tough, no-nonsense bounty hunter with a sharp wit and quick reflexes. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply troubled soul, haunted by the memories of his past and struggling to form meaningful connections with others. His unwavering dedication to justice is rooted in a sense of guilt and responsibility for not being able to save his friend Jānis.

**Interests:**
Engel Briedis has an inherent love for music and literature, which he inherited from his parents. He often finds solace in the works of European authors, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky or Friedrich Nietzsche, who resonated with his own experiences of disillusionment and rebellion. When not tracking down targets or brooding about his past, Engel can be found listening to classical music or playing the accordion, a skill he developed during his childhood in Riga.

It's worth noting that Engel Briedis is a highly driven individual, often fueled by a sense of purpose rather than emotional connection. His strong work ethic and unyielding commitment to justice have earned him respect and fear from those around him, but also leave him feeling isolated and alone at times.
