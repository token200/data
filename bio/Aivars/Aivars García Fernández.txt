Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Aivars García Fernández:

**Personality:**
Aivars is a determined and ambitious individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and has a strong work ethic, which drives him to uncover the truth, even in the face of danger or adversity. His passion for storytelling and investigative journalism makes him relentless in his pursuit of answers. Aivars also has a deep-seated mistrust of authority figures, which stems from his experiences as a journalist.

**Physical Attributes:**
Aivars is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often unkempt and messy, adding to his rugged and intellectual demeanor. He has a lean build, which speaks to his active lifestyle as a journalist.

**Interests:**
Aivars is deeply interested in investigative journalism, politics, and current events. He is well-versed in history, particularly the tumultuous period of Spanish history that led to the city of Barcelona becoming the vibrant metropolis it is today. His love for storytelling also drives him to explore the world of literature, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology.

Aivars is an avid coffee drinker and can often be found at Café dels Àngels, sipping on a strong espresso while researching or working on his next story. He is also a fan of local Catalan cuisine, particularly traditional dishes like escalivada and pa amb tomàquet.

Despite his love for the city, Aivars has a tendency to be introverted and reserved, preferring the company of books and research to social gatherings. However, once you get to know him, he opens up and reveals a dry sense of humor and a quick wit that often catches those around him off guard.
