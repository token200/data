**Personality:**
Aivars Bāk is a charismatic and confident individual. He has a natural ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and is known for his empathy and understanding. Aivars values honesty and authenticity above all else, which makes him a trustworthy friend and partner. Despite his outgoing nature, he can also be introspective and reserved at times.
