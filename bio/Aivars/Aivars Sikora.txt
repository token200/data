Here is a summary of Aivars Sikora's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aivars is an obsessive individual with a strong drive for innovation. His colleagues often joke that he has no work-life balance, but it's clear that his personal tragedy - the loss of his sister in a car accident when she was just 18 years old - fuels his determination to understand and control the forces of nature. He is fiercely intelligent and willing to push boundaries, but also struggles with the ethics of his work.

**Physical Attributes:** Aivars stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic build that suggests a keen sense of physical presence. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait he inherited from his sister, which often seem to bore into those he meets as if sizing them up. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in messy strands.

**Interests:** Aivars' primary interest is artificial intelligence and neuroscience, driven by his desire to crack the code of self-sustaining AI systems. He is particularly fascinated by the potential implications of such technology on industries like healthcare, finance, and beyond. His work has also sparked an intense curiosity about ethics and morality in the face of advanced technology.

In terms of hobbies or interests outside of work, Aivars' obsession with innovation might leave little room for leisure activities. However, it can be inferred that his drive is also fueled by a deep sense of personal responsibility to honor his sister's memory and continue her work.
