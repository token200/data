Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Emperor Aivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Physical Attributes:** Emperor Aivars stands at an impressive 6 feet 2 inches tall, with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark brown hair is often worn long and styled in a manner befitting his imperial status. He has a strong jawline and sharp features, giving him a regal and authoritative presence.

**Personality:** Aivars is a complex and multifaceted individual, driven by both ambition and madness. As the self-proclaimed god-king of Rome, he believes himself to be chosen by the gods themselves to rule over their creation. This conviction has led him down a path of ruthless determination and single-minded pursuit of power. Despite this, Aivars is not without his vulnerabilities - he struggles with the weight of responsibility and the fear that he may lose control.

**Interests:** Aivars's interests are centered around maintaining his grip on power and understanding the divine will that guides him. He is deeply invested in uncovering the secrets of the gods, and seeks out any means necessary to solidify his hold on Rome. This includes seeking the counsel of advisors like Eutropius, as well as pursuing forbidden knowledge through mysterious and often perilous means.

Despite his focus on power and divinity, Aivars also appears to have a deep fascination with the world around him - from the vibrant colors and exotic spices of the market to the intricate workings of the city itself. This curiosity suggests that beneath his authoritarian exterior, Aivars may harbor a more introspective and enigmatic personality.

In short, Emperor Aivars is a man driven by both his own ambition and the gods' expectations - a complex blend of power, madness, and mysticism that will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.
