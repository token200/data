**Physical Attributes:** Aivars stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of exploring Riga's streets on foot. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to sparkle with curiosity when he's investigating a lead. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a somewhat rumpled appearance that belies his sharp mind.

**Personality:** Aivars is a driven and ambitious individual, fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth. He's intensely curious, always sniffing out new information and connections, and has an uncanny ability to connect with people from all walks of life. His passion for journalism is matched only by his passion for justice, and he'll stop at nothing to expose the powerful and reveal hidden secrets.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Aivars' interests are centered around current events, politics, and social justice. He's deeply interested in history, particularly the stories of Latvian revolutionaries and activists who paved the way for the country's modern-day struggles. When he's not working, he enjoys exploring Riga's hidden corners, trying out new restaurants, and attending underground cultural events. Music is also a significant interest of his, with a particular fondness for avant-garde bands and local musicians.

**Hobbies:** In his free time, Aivars loves to write poetry and short stories, often inspired by the people and places he encounters in his investigations. He's also an avid reader, devouring books on everything from history to science fiction. When it comes to exercise, Aivars is a bit of a night owl, preferring late-night walks along the Daugava River or jogging through Riga's parks under the stars.

**Quirks:** Aivars has a habit of carrying around a small notebook and pen with him wherever he goes, jotting down observations and ideas as they come to him. He's also known to be a bit of a loner, preferring the company of his thoughts to that of others – but only when it comes to matters of great importance. When working on a story, Aivars often becomes so absorbed that he forgets to eat or sleep, earning him the nickname "The Riga Rat" among his colleagues.
