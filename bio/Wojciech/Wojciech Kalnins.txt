Here is a summary of Wojciech Kalnins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Wojciech Kalnins stands at an imposing 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build that hints at his sharp intellect. His piercing green eyes are his most striking feature, seeming to bore into those he meets as if sizing them up for some unknown purpose. His dark brown hair is always impeccably styled, framing his angular face and accentuating his sharp jawline. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his enigmatic aura.

**Personality:** Wojciech Kalnins exudes quiet confidence and authority, commanding respect from those around him without ever having to raise his voice. His piercing gaze can be unnerving, but it's tempered by a dry wit and a sharp intellect that makes him a compelling listener. He has an air of mystery about him, as if he's always hiding secrets beneath his polished exterior. Despite this, there's an underlying kindness in his eyes that suggests a deep empathy for the artistic visionaries he works with.

**Interests:** Wojciech Kalnins is deeply passionate about art, particularly rare and unusual pieces that challenge societal norms and push boundaries. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of art history and theory, which he uses to inform his curation decisions and build relationships with artists. Outside of the gallery, Wojciech enjoys attending avant-garde performances, experimental theater productions, and underground music events that showcase innovative talent.

In addition to his love of art, Wojciech is also drawn to philosophical and intellectual pursuits, often engaging in lively debates with fellow thinkers about politics, ethics, and social justice. He's a voracious reader, devouring books on history, psychology, and philosophy, which he believes informs his artistic taste and helps him connect the dots between seemingly disparate ideas.

When he's not running his gallery or advising young artists like Emma, Wojciech can be found exploring urban landscapes, attending underground art collectives, or simply observing the world around him with a keen eye for observation.
