**Personality:**
Wojciech Zieliński is a man shrouded in mystery. He exudes an air of caution and wariness, as if he's constantly on guard against unknown threats. This stems from his experiences during the Warsaw Uprising and Soviet occupation, where survival depended on stealth and vigilance. Despite this, there's an underlying intensity to him - a focus that borders on obsession. Wojciech is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to keep to himself rather than be drawn into the spotlight.

However, as he opens up to Sofia, it becomes clear that beneath his gruff exterior lies a deep well of emotions and unspoken pain. He's haunted by past choices and actions, and struggles with feelings of guilt and regret. This vulnerability is tempered by an inner resilience and resourcefulness - Wojciech has learned to rely on himself, even when the world seems against him.

**Interests:**
Wojciech Zieliński has a quiet passion for history, particularly the hidden stories and legends of Krakow's old town. He spends hours poring over dusty books in his bookshop, Sword and Lies, seeking out forgotten tales of resistance fighters, secret societies, and other unsung heroes.

As he navigates the city's streets at night, Wojciech is drawn to the shadows - both literal and metaphorical. He finds solace in the silence, allowing him to reflect on his experiences and the lessons they've taught him. In these moments of solitude, he begins to weave together a narrative of his life, piecing together the fragments of his past into a narrative that's both poignant and haunting.

In Sofia, Wojciech sees a kindred spirit - someone who can see beyond the surface level of things and uncover the hidden stories beneath. Together, they embark on a journey of discovery, one that may ultimately reveal more about themselves than the city itself ever could.
