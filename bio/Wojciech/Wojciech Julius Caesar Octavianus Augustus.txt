Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost navy blue in intensity

Personality:
Wojciech is a complex individual with a mix of emotions. On one hand, he's fiercely intelligent and calculating, having grown up under the shadow of his father Julius Caesar's rule. He has an inherent understanding of politics and power dynamics, which serves him well in maintaining control over the vast Roman Empire. However, this calculation can sometimes come at the cost of empathy or compassion for others.

On another hand, Wojciech is driven by personal loss and a sense of guilt. The assassination of his father left him feeling bereft, and he struggles to connect with people on an emotional level. His feelings are often clouded by anger and resentment toward those who wronged him.

Despite this, Wojciech has shown glimpses of vulnerability in his interactions with Aurelia Octavia and Gaius Calpurnius Piso. He's capable of showing kindness and compassion to those he trusts.

Wojciech is deeply invested in maintaining the stability and security of the Roman Empire. As a ruler, his primary interest lies in ensuring the survival and prosperity of Rome, even if it means making difficult decisions or sacrificing personal relationships.

On a more personal level, Wojciech is drawn to understanding his family's history and legacy. He's fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Aurelia Octavia, and will go to great lengths to protect her and their interests.

Wojciech also seems to be fascinated by the mysteries of power and politics. His encounters with Gaius Calpurnius Piso hint at a growing interest in uncovering hidden plots or conspiracies within his own court.
