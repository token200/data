**Personality:** Wojciech Olsen is an enigmatic and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. He has a calm and collected demeanor, which belies the intensity of his pursuit for truth. His piercing green eyes seem to hold secrets of their own, hinting at a complex and nuanced personality. Despite his tough exterior, Wojciech has a deep-seated need to uncover the truth about his father's disappearance, which drives him to take risks and push boundaries.

**Physical Attributes:** Wojciech stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of intense physical activity while investigating. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his angular face and sharp jawline. His piercing green eyes are a striking feature, seeming to bore into those he meets as if searching for hidden truths. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a troubled past.

**Interests:** Wojciech's interests revolve around uncovering the truth about his father's disappearance and taking down the powerful crime syndicate responsible.

In terms of personal interests outside of work, it's not clear what Wojciech enjoys doing in his free time. However, based on his tough and no-nonsense demeanor, it's possible that he has a fondness for solitary activities such as hiking or martial arts training. His focus on justice may also lead him to be more introverted and less inclined to engage in social activities, preferring instead to spend time researching and gathering information.
