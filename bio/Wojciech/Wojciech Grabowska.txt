Here's a summary of Wojciech Grabowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wojciech is a passionate and determined individual who refuses to compromise his artistic vision. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a strong sense of self-expression that drives him to push boundaries in his music. Despite facing rejection from the record label, he remains steadfast and unwavering in his commitment to his art. Wojciech is also a romantic at heart, drawing inspiration from Chopin and Debussy's works, which speaks to his emotional and introspective nature.

**Physical Attributes:** Wojciech Jerzy Grabowska stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy, endearing manner that adds to his relaxed demeanor. His eyes are an piercing shade of blue, which seem to sparkle with creativity when discussing music or life's deeper meaning.

His compositions often reflect his love for Poland's rich history and culture, drawing inspiration from its myths, legends, and folk tales.

* Traveling to new cities and immersing himself in different cultures
* Spontaneous jam sessions with fellow musicians

Wojciech's creative energy is contagious, inspiring those around him to take risks and explore their own artistic passions.
