Here's a summary of Wojciech Kalnina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Wojciech stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown and flecked with grey, often styled neatly but untidily in the manner of a man who has spent more time behind his desk than in front of a mirror. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up and searching for hidden truths. He wears wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose, giving him an air of intellectual intensity.

**Personality:** Wojciech is a man of quiet confidence and reserved demeanor, with an aura of mystery that commands respect from those who know him. Despite his calm exterior, he has a sharp mind and a keen analytical spirit, which serves him well in his work as a historian. He is driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire to uncover the truth, often finding himself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of history. Wojciech is also intensely private, with few close relationships outside of his professional sphere.

**Interests:** As a renowned historian and expert in Eastern European affairs, Wojciech's interests are centered around understanding the complexities of politics, culture, and society in the region. He has a particular fascination with the intersection of politics and culture, which drives his research into topics such as Soviet-era propaganda, dissident movements, and the impact of communist regimes on local communities. When not buried in dusty tomes or pouring over manuscripts, Wojciech enjoys long walks through the city, lost in thought, and is an avid reader of philosophical texts and literary classics.

It's worth noting that Wojciech's experience with Victor, the former KGB agent, has seemed to shake off some of his initial wariness, allowing him to connect with people on a more personal level. This newfound openness suggests that he may be more open-minded than initially thought.
