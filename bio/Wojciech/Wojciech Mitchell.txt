Here's a summary of Wojciech Mitchell's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Wojciech is a 35-year-old man who stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his sharp face and intense eyes. His eye color is an unsettling shade of blue, almost indigo, which seems to bore into those he looks at. His features are angular and gaunt, reflecting the toll his work has taken on his physical health.

**Personality:** Wojciech Mitchell is a complex and introverted individual, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of dark matter. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. Despite this, he possesses a dry sense of humor and can be witty when provoked, as evidenced by his wry smile in response to Sarah's question about self-care.

**Interests:** Wojciech's passion for physics is all-consuming, and he spends most of his waking hours studying the intricacies of dark matter. His work is both personal and professional, driven by a desire to understand the fundamental nature of reality. In his free time (which he rarely has), he enjoys reading theoretical works on cosmology and astrophysics, often devoting entire evenings to pouring over equations and research papers.

Wojciech's interests extend beyond physics, however, as hinted at in his conversation with Sarah about being "haunted by doubt." It is clear that there are deeper forces at play here, which threaten not just Wojciech's own life but the lives of those around him. Despite this, Wojciech remains resolute and determined to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

In summary, Wojciech Mitchell is a brilliant physicist with a dark past and a penchant for mystery, driven by an unyielding passion for understanding the secrets of the universe.
