Here's a summary of the fictional character Māris Avendaño:

**Physical Attributes:** Māris stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often tied up in a ponytail, and her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to bore into those she interviews. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, giving her a unique and rugged appearance.

**Personality:** Māris is a fearless and ambitious journalist who is not afraid to take risks in pursuit of the truth. She is fiercely intelligent and has a keen eye for detail, which serves her well in her investigative reporting. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate heart and a strong sense of justice, driving her to expose corruption and inequality in her community.

**Interests:** Māris is passionate about social justice and storytelling, and spends much of her free time researching and writing about topics related to human rights, politics, and economics. She is an avid reader of history books and philosophy texts, and enjoys attending documentaries and lectures on these subjects. In her personal life, she loves hiking and practicing yoga, seeking balance and relaxation in the midst of her busy career.

Note that I made up some details about Māris's physical appearance (e.g., the nose ring), as there was no information available in the original short story to provide a clear picture of her appearance.
