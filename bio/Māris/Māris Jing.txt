I'd love to help! Since I couldn't find any information on the character Māris Jing, I'll create a new story with some additional details about him. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, spiky look
* Skin Tone: Olive with a subtle golden undertone

**Personality:**

Māris Jing is a complex and driven individual. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to use his unique abilities for the greater good. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards those who have been wronged.

As a memory thief, Māris has developed a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or irreverent at times. However, this façade hides a deep emotional vulnerability and a strong desire to protect others from suffering the same fate he did in his troubled past.

**Interests:**

Māris is an avid reader and collector of rare, vintage books on history, philosophy, and psychology. He's fascinated by the human mind and its many mysteries, which fuels his curiosity about memory and its role in shaping our identities.

In his free time, Māris enjoys practicing martial arts (mainly kickboxing) to maintain physical discipline and mental clarity. He's also an amateur musician, playing the guitar and composing songs that reflect his emotions and experiences.

**Background:**

Māris Jing grew up on the streets of New Eden, where he learned early on how to rely on himself and trust no one. His parents were killed in a brutal gang war when he was just a teenager, leaving him orphaned and adrift.

With his unique ability, Māris struggled to find purpose and meaning in life. However, after stumbling upon the world of memories and experiencing the weight of secrets and lies firsthand, he discovered his true calling: using his powers to expose truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.
