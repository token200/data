He is practical and resourceful, able to navigate the challenging waters of the Baltic Sea with ease. Despite the difficulties he faces, including the scarcity of fish this season, Māris remains optimistic and determined. He values tradition and heritage, as evidenced by his reverence for the old wreck of the "Anna-Maria" and his family's connection to the sea.

He is also a devoted father and husband, putting the needs of his loved ones before his own. His wife, Elza, and their two young children, Kristiina and Jaan, are an essential part of his life, and he feels responsible for providing for them. Māris's sense of duty and loyalty to those closest to him is evident in his actions throughout the story.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, we do not have any detailed physical descriptions of Māris in the provided text. However, based on his occupation as a fisherman and the fact that he has spent many years at sea, it can be inferred that he is likely a tall and sturdy individual, possibly with weathered skin and eyes that are accustomed to the harsh conditions of the ocean.

His height and eye color are not specified, but given his rugged appearance, it's possible that he stands over 6 feet (183 cm) and has piercing blue or green eyes, which would be characteristic of a person who spends most of their time outdoors in the Baltic Sea.

**Interests:** Māris is deeply invested in his life as a fisherman and is passionate about preserving traditional skills and knowledge. He takes great pride in his family's legacy, including the old fishing boat "Kaleva" that has been passed down through generations. The sea is not just a place of work for him but also a source of comfort, spirituality, and connection to his heritage.

He values experience, tradition, and hard work, which are reflected in his words of wisdom to Kristiina and Jaan about facing challenges with courage and determination. Māris's interests extend beyond fishing, however, as he is also drawn to the sea itself, with a sense of awe and reverence for its power and mystery.
