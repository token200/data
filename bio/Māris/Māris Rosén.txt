Here's a summary of the fictional character Māris Rosén's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Māris is an enigmatic figure known for his intensity and sense of duty. He is driven by a deep responsibility to safeguard ancient knowledge and protect the innocent from those who would misuse it. Despite his mysterious nature, he has a keen sense of intuition and can discern the true intentions of those around him. However, his strong sense of purpose sometimes makes him come across as aloof or intimidating, leaving others feeling uneasy in his presence.

**Physical Attributes:** Māris is tall, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm), with a lean yet athletic build that speaks to his agility and quick reflexes. His eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to gleam with an otherworldly intensity in the right light. His dark hair is often unkempt, framing a face that appears chiseled from stone. A sharp jawline and piercing features only add to his air of mystique.

**Interests:** As a master of the arcane arts, Māris's primary interests lie in uncovering and mastering ancient spells, incantations, and rituals. He is deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, particularly those related to magic, the occult, and the hidden forces that shape reality. His extensive knowledge spans various subjects, including astronomy, alchemy, and demonology.

Outside of his work, Māris enjoys navigating Riga's hidden corners, uncovering forgotten secrets, and exploring the city's rich history. He is particularly drawn to the atmospheric and eerie aspects of the city, often seeking out dimly lit alleys and abandoned buildings to call his own. His passion for magic and mystery drives him to continue his pursuit of knowledge, always pushing the boundaries of what he thinks he knows.

In terms of hobbies, Māris might enjoy reading rare and ancient texts, experimenting with new spellcraft techniques, or practicing meditation and introspection to balance his intense focus on his craft. Despite his serious demeanor, he has a dry sense of humor that only reveals itself in rare moments of levity.

Māris's relationship with Līga, his apprentice, brings out the more compassionate side of his personality. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about, but also remains guarded when necessary to shield them from the dangers and complexities of his world.
