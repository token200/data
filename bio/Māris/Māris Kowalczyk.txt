Here's a summary of Māris Kowalczyk's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Māris appears to be an introspective and creative person, often lost in thought as he ponders his writing projects. He has a dry sense of humor, which is evident when Alīna playfully refers to him as "old man." Despite this, he exudes a sense of kindness and gratitude towards those around him, particularly Alīna, whom he appreciates for her understanding.

**Physical Attributes:** Although the story doesn't provide extensive physical details, we can infer some attributes:

* Height: Māris is likely an older adult, possibly in his 50s or 60s, given that Alīna refers to him as "old man." He may not be extremely tall, but he has a presence that commands attention.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, the story doesn't specify Māris's eye color. However, based on his introspective nature and writerly demeanor, it's possible that his eyes are warm and intelligent, perhaps with a deep brown or hazel hue.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Māris is a writer, journalist, and historian. His passion lies in uncovering the stories of Latvia's past and shedding light on often-forgotten events. He's currently working on a novel that has hit a creative roadblock, but his encounter with Alīna helps him break through.

Additionally, it can be inferred that Māris values solitude and quiet contemplation, as he finds himself alone in the dimly lit café, sipping coffee and scribbling notes. He's likely an introvert who draws energy from writing and observing the world around him.
