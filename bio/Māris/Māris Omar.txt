Here's a summary of Māris Omar's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Māris is a tall and lean individual, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm). His eye color is an piercing shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to hold a deep intensity that belies his calm demeanor. His hair is dark brown and often falls in tangled locks down his back, giving him an air of perpetual dishevelment. He has a wiry build, honed from years of intense physical activity, and his fingers are stained with paint as if he's always touching something creative.

**Personality:**
Māris is a brooding and introspective individual, often lost in thought as he pours his emotions onto the canvas. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor that surfaces only when he feels completely alone or is sharing intimate moments with Leilani. He's fiercely private and guarded, with walls built around himself to protect against the world outside. However, once you've breached those defenses, Māris reveals a deep well of vulnerability and empathy.

**Interests:**
Māris is an avid painter, spending hours lost in his art studio, experimenting with colors and textures. His passion for art stems from a need to express himself, particularly after experiencing great loss. He's also deeply interested in the human condition, drawn to stories of love, loss, and longing that find their way into his work. When not painting, Māris is an avid reader of literature, devouring books on philosophy, poetry, and history. Music plays a significant role in his life as well; he often listens to haunting melodies and classical compositions to stimulate his creativity.

While his art may seem turbulent and intense, it's actually a reflection of Māris' desire for connection and understanding in the world around him.
