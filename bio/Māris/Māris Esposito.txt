Since there's no existing information on Māris Esposito, I'll create a new character and write a short summary about them. Here it is:

**Name:** Māris Esposito
**Age:** 25
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Hazel with a warm golden ring around the iris
**Physical Attributes:** Māris has a lean, athletic build and stands out for his striking hazel eyes. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. He sports a scruffy beard that he sometimes styles in a bushy, laid-back manner.

**Personality:** Māris is an adventurous free spirit with a love for the unknown. He's fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. His quick wit and sharp intellect make him an excellent problem solver, often thinking on his feet to get out of sticky situations. Despite his tough exterior, Māris has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

**Interests:** Māris is passionate about astronomy and geology. He spends most of his free time gazing up at the stars, lost in the vastness of the universe. When not exploring the wilderness or stargazing, he enjoys collecting rare minerals and gems. His fascination with the natural world often takes him to remote locations, where he can immerse himself in nature's beauty.

If you'd like me to create a short story based on this character, I'd be happy to do so!
