Based on the inspiration provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Mariusz Kabylbekova:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue with an unusual shade of green around his irises
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of caramel at the temples, often worn in a messy, piecey style
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle smattering of freckles across his cheeks and nose

**Personality:**

Mariusz Kabylbekova is an inquisitive and ambitious individual with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe. He possesses an insatiable curiosity, often finding himself lost in thought as he ponders the intricacies of celestial mechanics. His sharp intellect and quick wit make him an excellent communicator, able to distill complex concepts into accessible language for both peers and laymen alike.

Despite his intense focus on his work, Mariusz is deeply empathetic and has a natural talent for connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. He is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends and will go to great lengths to support and protect them.

**Interests:**

* Astrophysics and cosmology
* Reading scientific papers and textbooks
* Hiking and exploring the outdoors
* Playing the piano (he's particularly fond of Chopin)
* Cooking and trying out new recipes from various cultures

**Quirks:**

Mariusz has a habit of talking to himself when discussing complex theories or ideas, often using pseudonyms or nicknames for himself as if he were speaking with an alternate persona. He also keeps a small notebook in his pocket where he jot down fleeting insights and observations throughout the day.

When not working on his research, Mariusz can be found listening to music, sipping tea, or stargazing on clear nights when the sky is at its most breathtaking. His fascination with the cosmos drives him forward, fueling an insatiable desire to explore and understand the workings of the universe.
