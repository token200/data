**Physical Attributes:** Mariusz stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build, suggesting a lifelong dedication to physical activity and outdoor pursuits. His eyes are a bright blue color that sparkles with intelligence, indicating his exceptional cognitive abilities. His hair is dark brown, often neatly trimmed in a stylish manner that adds to his professional demeanor.

**Interests:** Mariusz's interests revolve around archaeology, ancient civilizations, and historical research. He spends most of his free time pouring over texts, scouring the countryside for artifacts, and exploring new areas in search of lost cities or forgotten knowledge. In addition to his love for discovery, Mariusz seems to have a deep appreciation for history, architecture, and technology, which guides his approach to understanding the long-lost city of Zerzura.
