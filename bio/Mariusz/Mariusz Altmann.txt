Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Mariusz Altmann:

**Personality:** Mariusz Altmann is a complex and brooding individual, haunted by his past experiences during World War II. He is a man of great resilience and determination, having fought for survival on the rough streets of Warsaw as a young boy. However, this toughness has also made him emotionally guarded, with a tendency to suppress his emotions and hide behind a mask of stoicism. Despite this, he is deeply empathetic and compassionate, particularly towards those who have suffered like him.

**Physical Attributes:** Mariusz Altmann is a tall and imposing figure, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a ruggedly handsome face and piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a depth of sadness. His dark hair is often unkempt, and his strong jawline gives him a resolute appearance.

**Interests:** As a carpenter, Mariusz has always had a passion for working with his hands and creating something beautiful from raw materials. He finds solace in the repetitive motion of hammering nails into wood, the smell of sawdust and varnish filling the air as he loses himself in his work. In addition to carpentry, Mariusz is an avid reader, devouring books on history, psychology, and philosophy in a bid to understand the complexities of human nature. He is also a skilled painter, using art as a means of expression and catharsis.

It's worth noting that Mariusz's past experiences have left him with some physical scars, including a small scar above his left eyebrow and a silver prosthetic leg that he lost during the war. Despite these physical reminders of his trauma, Mariusz remains strong and determined, driven by a desire to make sense of his life and find redemption in a world that has often seemed cruel and unforgiving.
