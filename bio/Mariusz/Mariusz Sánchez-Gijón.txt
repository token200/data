Since Mariusz Sánchez-Gijón is not a real character, I'll create a fictional profile for him.

**Physical Attributes:**
Mariusz Sánchez-Gijón is 5'11" (180 cm) tall with piercing blue eyes and dark brown hair that's often styled in a messy, textured manner. He has a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of playing football.

**Personality:**
Mariusz is a charismatic and confident individual who exudes a sense of calmness and composure on the pitch. Off the field, he's warm, witty, and has a wicked sense of humor that often leaves his friends and teammates in stitches. He's fiercely competitive and driven, always striving to improve his game and push himself to new heights.

**Interests:**
Mariusz is passionate about music – he plays the guitar in his spare time and has released an EP or two under a pseudonym. He's also an avid reader of philosophy and psychology books, which helps him understand human behavior and make better decisions on the field. When he's not playing football or reading, Mariusz loves to explore new cities and try out local cuisine.
