**Physical Attributes:** Mariusz stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His wild mane of curly brown hair often escapes his attempts to tame it, framing his heart-shaped face. His piercing emerald eyes seem to gleam with an inner light, reflecting the intensity of his focus and determination.

**Personality:** Mariusz is driven by a singular desire to uncover the truth about his past and his mysterious bloodline. He is fiercely independent and determined, often plunging headfirst into the unknown to uncover secrets. Despite this, he has a deep sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

**Interests:** Mariusz's primary interest is unraveling the mysteries of his own past and unlocking the secrets hidden within Aethoria's ancient ruins. He is deeply passionate about mastering the arcane arts, particularly elemental magic, which allows him to tap into the raw power of the universe.
