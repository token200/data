- Eye Color: Bright blue
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt
- Skin Tone: Pale, with a subtle scattering of freckles across his nose

**Personality:**

Gerard is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who has always been driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe. He can come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him well, but this exterior hides a kind and generous soul who is passionate about his work. Gerard is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused, often getting lost in his own world of equations and theories.

**Interests:**

Gerard's primary interest is mathematics, particularly pure mathematics. He spends most of his time working on his latest research projects, delving deep into complex equations and theorem after theorem. His work ranges from non-Euclidean geometry to topological invariants, and he has made significant contributions to the field.

Other interests and hobbies are not explicitly mentioned in the short story, but based on Gerard's focus on mathematics, it can be inferred that his other passions might include:

- Reading theoretical physics texts
- Exploring philosophical implications of mathematical discoveries
- Solving complex problems and puzzles as a form of mental exercise

Gerard's love for mathematics is all-consuming, but he has found an appreciation for the work of others through his correspondence with Emma, which suggests that he may have a more social side to his personality.
