**Personality:** Gerard is a complex and brooding individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a tendency to be introspective and withdrawn, often preferring to observe rather than participate in social situations.

His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that frames his sharp features. His eyes are his most striking feature - piercing blue, they seem to bore into those he looks at, as if searching for something.

He spends hours lost in thought and contemplation, exploring the woods surrounding Ravenswood and finding solace in the quiet rhythms of nature. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on everything from philosophy to poetry. Music plays a significant role in his life as well, with many of Sarah's favorite songs still echoing in his mind.
