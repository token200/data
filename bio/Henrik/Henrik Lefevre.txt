Here's a summary of the fictional character Henrik Lefevre:

**Physical Attributes:**
Henrik stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often neatly styled, framing his angular face. His eyes are piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he encounters, as if sizing them up for clues. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely obtained during one of his early cases.

**Personality:**
Henrik is a complex and driven individual with a strong sense of justice and compassion. Born into poverty, these values were instilled in him by his loving parents, Pierre and Colette Lefevre. As a detective, Henrik is fiercely intelligent and intuitive, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues to solve even the most complex cases. His obsession with finding missing persons is unmatched, often leading him to neglect his own well-being and relationships.

**Interests:**
Despite his tough exterior, Henrik has a soft spot for his family and those in need. He is deeply empathetic and cares deeply about the people he helps through his detective work. Outside of his profession, Henrik enjoys reading classical literature and listening to French jazz music. His humble beginnings on the streets of Paris have given him a unique perspective on life, one that informs his approach to both crime solving and human relationships.

**Additional Traits:**
Henrik is a bit of an introvert, preferring to focus on his cases rather than engaging in small talk or social events. However, when working closely with others, he reveals a dry sense of humor and an ability to think outside the box. His dedication to justice often leads him to take risks and push boundaries, which can put him at odds with authority figures. Despite this, Henrik's passion for his work is unwavering, making him one of the most respected detectives in the city.
