Her features are angular and strong, giving her an air of quiet confidence.

In addition to her passion for photography, Romy is also deeply interested in storytelling and the art of conveying emotion through visual means. She finds solace in the quiet moments, when the world seems still, and it's only her thoughts that fill the air.
