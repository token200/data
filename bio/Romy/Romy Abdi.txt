Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Romy Abdi either. It seems that Romy Abdi is not a known or published character in books, movies, TV shows, or other forms of media.

However, if you would like to create a new character, I'd be happy to help! Please provide me with some context or details about who Romy Abdi is and what kind of story you envision for them. For example:

* What genre do you want the character to belong to (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, romance, mystery)?
* Is Romy Abdi a protagonist/antagonist, love interest, or supporting character?
* Are there any specific traits, skills, or characteristics you'd like Romy Abdi to have?

Once I have this information, I can help you develop the character's personality, physical attributes, and interests.
