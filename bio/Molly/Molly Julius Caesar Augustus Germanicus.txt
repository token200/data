Based on the provided short story about Roman Emperor Augustus (also known as Octavian), I have created a fictional character profile for Molly Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Blue-Grey, with a distinctive piercing quality that seems to see right through to the soul
- Hair: Dark brown, straight, and slightly tousled, often tied back in a neat braid or ponytail when worn formally
- Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical activity and military campaigns
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent cheekbones, and a nose slightly upturned at the tip

Personality:
- Molly is a natural leader, with an innate sense of confidence and authority that commands respect without demanding it.
- Despite her commanding presence, she possesses a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards those in need.
- She is fiercely intelligent and strategic thinker, always planning several steps ahead to ensure the long-term success of her endeavors.

Interests:
- Molly has a deep love for history, particularly the stories of great leaders who came before her. She often spends hours studying ancient texts and biographies to learn from their triumphs and failures.
- Music holds a special place in her heart; she is an accomplished violinist and plays regularly to relax and express herself creatively.
- Molly has a keen interest in architecture, particularly Roman design. She enjoys designing new buildings and structures that blend seamlessly into the existing landscape.

Background:
Molly grew up under the guidance of Augustus (also known as Octavian), who took her under his wing after her parents' untimely passing when she was just a child. Trained in diplomacy, strategy, and leadership from a young age, Molly blossomed into an exceptional stateswoman, earning the respect and admiration of those around her.

While inspired by Augustus's legacy, Molly has forged her own path, leveraging her unique blend of intelligence, empathy, and natural charm to build bridges between nations and communities.
