Based on the brief summary provided, I'll create a fictional character profile for Sakurai Kortajarena:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost indigo in shade
* Hair: Jet-black, often worn long and tied back with a leather thong
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (a souvenir from a childhood accident)
* Style: Kortajarena's attire consists of traditional Akakawan armor with a white hakama and a matching katana at his side. When not in battle, he favors simple yet practical clothing, often in shades of earthy brown and green.

**Personality:**

Kortajarena is a driven and determined individual, forged by his experiences as a young apprentice under Master Tanaka. He possesses unwavering courage, unshakeable loyalty, and an unrelenting commitment to justice. His natural leadership abilities have earned him the respect of his allies, while his fierce independence often leads him to challenge authority when necessary.

Despite his strong sense of duty, Kortajarena is haunted by a deep-seated vulnerability, stemming from his mentor's tragic fall in battle. This emotional scar has taught him to trust few people and to walk alone, even in the face of overwhelming odds. His quiet introspection belies a fierce intellect and strategic thinking, making him an expert tactician.

**Interests:**

Kortajarena is deeply passionate about Kenjutsu, the ancient art of Japanese swordsmanship, which has been his primary focus since childhood. He is also an accomplished scholar of Akakawan history and mythology, having spent countless hours studying under Master Tanaka's tutelage.

When not honing his martial skills or exploring the mystical realms, Kortajarena enjoys practicing Zen meditation and connecting with nature. His deep respect for the natural world has led him to develop a spiritual connection with the land and its creatures, which he believes is crucial to understanding the true meaning of his destiny.
