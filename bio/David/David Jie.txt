Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character David Jie:

**Personality:** David is a quiet, unassuming man who is not easily visible to the outside world. However, beneath his ordinary demeanor lies a complex and creative individual with a deep desire for connection, understanding, and self-expression. He is empathetic, open-minded, and a good listener, as evident in his ability to form a strong bond with Wong. His personality can be described as introspective, artistic, and sensitive.

**Physical Attributes:** David is not specified to have any distinctive physical features beyond being ordinary-looking. However, for the sake of completeness, let's imagine that he stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with a lean build, and has warm, dark brown eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom. His hair is likely black, styled neatly in a way that hides his introspective nature.

**Interests:** David's primary interests revolve around literature, poetry, and language. He finds solace in writing verse inspired by the world around him, often incorporating sensory details from his experiences working at the family restaurant. Music, art, and cultural heritage are also significant to him, as he draws inspiration from the diverse traditions of San Francisco's Chinatown. His love for language is matched only by his desire for meaningful connections with others.

Over time, David has come to appreciate the power of storytelling and the importance of preserving and sharing cultural heritage through words. He sees himself as a weaver of stories, bridging gaps between different communities and fostering understanding through shared expressions of humanity.

In Wong's presence, David finds a sense of recognition, validation, and connection that transcends their differences. As they sit together at his desk, pouring out verse and laughter, it becomes clear that David's interests are not just about personal expression but also about building bridges between people and fostering empathy in an increasingly complex world.
