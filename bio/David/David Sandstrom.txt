Based on the short story, here is a summary of David Sandstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** David Sandstrom is a complex and introspective individual with a strong sense of duty. He has spent years working undercover for the CIA, which has likely shaped his worldview and led to a certain level of stoicism. However, as he struggles to adjust to life outside the shadows, his sense of morality is called into question, revealing a more vulnerable side. Despite this, he is driven by a strong desire to protect others and serve his country, even if he is no longer sure what is right or wrong.

**Physical Attributes:** David Sandstrom appears to be in his late 50s or early 60s, with a tall and lean build. His height is likely around 6'2" (188 cm), which is consistent with the physical presence of many CIA operatives. His eye color is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on the narrative tone, it's possible that he has eyes that are typically associated with Scandinavian or Northern European descent - perhaps blue or grey. His hair is likely grey and slicked back, adding to his rugged and worn appearance.

**Interests:** David Sandstrom appears to be a man of few interests outside of his work for the CIA. He seems content to spend most of his days wandering aimlessly, lost in thought, until he stumbles upon something that piques his interest - like the small caf√© in Berlin where he meets Lena. Once he connects with someone new and is drawn into their world, however, his interests shift towards getting to know them and exploring their perspective. He also seems to have a strong appreciation for history and the workings of human nature, as hinted at by his fascination with Lena's story.

It's worth noting that these are just inferences based on the short story, and there may be more to David Sandstrom than is revealed here.
