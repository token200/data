Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of the fictional character David Zarins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** David Zarins appears to be a thoughtful and introspective person who values his relationships with others. He is nostalgic for the past and appreciates the company of old friends, as evident from his excitement when Jack arrives at the jazz club. He also seems to be someone who can laugh at himself and doesn't mind being teased by his friend Jack.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, not much is explicitly stated about David's physical attributes in the provided text. However, based on the description of Jack's appearance (graying hair at the temples and a sense of deeper wisdom), it can be inferred that David may also have some distinguished features as he ages. Assuming this is the case, here are some possible details:

* Height: 5'10" to 6'0" - This would make him slightly above average height.
* Eye Color: Brown or hazel eyes with a warm, expressive quality.

**Interests:** David's interests appear to be focused on art and music. He is drawn to the underground music scene in his youth, attends concerts, and enjoys discussions about philosophy with friends. His nostalgia for college days spent exploring the city and attending music shows suggests that he values creative expression and meaningful relationships.

Additional details: Given his background as a friend of Jack's who has been through tough times himself, David may be someone who is empathetic, supportive, and understanding towards others struggling with addiction or personal loss. His appreciation for the present moment (as evident from his gratitude for reconnecting with Jack) suggests that he values simplicity, connection, and living in the here and now.
