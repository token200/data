Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of David Tóth:

**Personality:** David Tóth is a complex and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He is a man of few words, preferring silence to express himself, but his piercing gaze can be unnerving, as if he's searching for something hidden beneath the surface. Despite this intensity, there's a warmth in his eyes that reveals itself only in fleeting moments, making him seem approachable yet commanding respect.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 6'1" (185 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Piercing blue, almost unforgiving
* **Face:** Weathered and lined with the depth of experiences, as if he's carried a burden on his skin.
* **Hair:** Unknown, possibly graying or gray-brown, which could add to his rugged demeanor.

**Interests:**

* Reading (books are stacked like old books on his shelves, waiting to be read one page at a time).
* Music (not explicitly mentioned in the passage, but given his fondness for cigar smoke and dimly lit rooms, it might be something that brings him solace or inspiration).
* Solitude (he seems comfortable with his isolation, perhaps even prefers it to human interaction).
* Cigar smoking (the scent of cigar smoke clings to his skin, suggesting he's a fan).

It's worth noting that Tóth is a man of few words, so we don't know much about his interests or hobbies beyond the ones mentioned above. His personality and physical attributes give us a glimpse into his character, while his interests remain open for interpretation.
