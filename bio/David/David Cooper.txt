**Physical Attributes:** David Cooper is a young adult with an athletic build, but no specific height is mentioned in the story. However, his slender frame suggests that he may be around 5'10" to 6'1" (178-185 cm) tall, which would make him slightly above average height for a male artist of his age group. His eye color is not explicitly stated, but based on his artistic nature and the description of Emma's kind eyes, it's likely that David has warm, expressive brown or hazel eyes.

**Personality:** David Cooper is an optimistic, creative individual with a passion for art and a love for learning. He's open-minded, enthusiastic, and willing to take risks in pursuit of his goals. His natural talent and curiosity make him a quick learner, and he's not afraid to ask questions or seek guidance from others (as seen in his request to Emma). David is also empathetic and kind, as evident from the way he connects with Emma and becomes invested in helping her art business.

**Interests:** David Cooper is an artist at heart, with a strong focus on painting landscapes. His love of art began at a young age, watching his mother paint vibrant sunsets on rainy days. As he grew older, his interest in art only deepened, leading him to attend art school and eventually establish himself as a talented painter. In addition to his artistic pursuits, David seems to appreciate the importance of mentorship and community connections (e.g., his friendship with Emma).
