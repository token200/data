However, there's also a hint of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior, suggesting that he may be more complex than meets the eye. His reserved nature and guarded responses imply that Nils has been hurt before, but he guards his emotions closely, making it difficult for others to get close to him.

**Other Details:** Based on the story, it's clear that Nils has a strong sense of pride and ownership when it comes to his restaurant, Sakura & Co. He's fiercely protective of his creations and values discretion above all else. Despite this, there's an air of mystery surrounding him, hinting at secrets and experiences from his past that he keeps hidden behind a carefully constructed facade.
