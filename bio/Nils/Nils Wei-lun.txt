Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Nils Wei-lun:

**Personality:**
Nils Wei-lun is described as a master craftsman with exceptional talent and dedication. He is passionate about his work and has a strong sense of pride in creating something truly remarkable. His fascination with woodworking and attention to detail suggest that he is a perfectionist who values quality and precision.

As a child, Nils was captivated by the art of woodworking, which suggests that he had a natural inclination towards creative pursuits from an early age. His father's influence likely played a significant role in shaping his interests and skills as a craftsman. As an adult, Nils appears to be a confident and self-assured individual who commands respect for his craft.

**Physical Attributes:**
Unfortunately, the original story does not provide detailed information about Nils' physical attributes beyond his slender fingers. However, based on the context and tone of the narrative, it can be inferred that:

* Height: While not specified, Nils is likely to be a slender and agile individual, suggesting that he may stand between 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet 2 inches tall.
* Eye Color: The story does not provide any information about Nils' eye color. However, it is possible that his eyes are warm and expressive, with a deep brown or golden hue that reflects his artistic personality.

**Interests:**
Nils Wei-lun's primary interest is woodworking, which is evident in the story. He finds joy and fulfillment in shaping and crafting wood into beautiful and intricate designs. His passion for woodworking is evident in the way he approaches each project, carefully selecting and working with the materials to bring forth his vision.

Beyond his love of woodworking, Nils appears to be a driven individual who values excellence and precision. His dedication to mastering his craft and pushing himself to new heights suggests that he has a strong sense of ambition and a desire for self-improvement.

It's also worth noting that Nils' interest in creating pieces with "magical properties" (as suggested by the Dragon's Blood wood) may indicate a deeper spiritual or philosophical connection to his art. This could suggest that he sees woodworking as more than just a practical skill, but rather as a way to tap into a higher sense of purpose and meaning.
