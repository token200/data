Based on the short story, here is a summary of Nils Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nils is a complex character with a rough exterior. He has a troubled past, having been a troublemaker in school and struggling to find stability on the streets. Despite his tough demeanor, he has a deep-seated need for comfort and security, which is why he holds onto small habits like running his hair through it. Nils is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, having learned to rely only on himself to survive. However, this independence comes with a cost, as he struggles to form meaningful connections with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Nils stands at 6'1" with an athletic build, likely honed from years of living on the streets and taking odd jobs. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem almost icy in contrast to the warmth of his personality. He has short, dark hair that often falls across his forehead, giving him a somewhat rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Nils is drawn to the darker corners of life, finding comfort in whiskey and dimly lit bars like the one he visits at the end of the story. Music or art are not mentioned as specific interests, but it's likely that Nils has an appreciation for something creative to balance out his rough exterior.

**Other Details:** Nils is a heavy smoker, having given up only recently. His past job as a bouncer suggests that he has a strong physical presence and may have had some experience with conflict resolution. Despite his tough exterior, Nils seems to have a deep emotional well, one that is often triggered by the loss of Lena, the person who tried to bring stability into his life.

Overall, Nils Faust appears to be a complex and nuanced character, driven by both his desire for independence and his need for human connection. His tough exterior hides a vulnerable soul, one that is slowly beginning to heal as he navigates his way through the city.
