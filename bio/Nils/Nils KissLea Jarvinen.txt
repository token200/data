Nils is of average height, standing at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, with a few stray strands framing his face. His eyes are an piercing shade of blue, reminiscent of a clear Scandinavian sky on a sunny day.

However, once you've earned his trust, Nils is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect and support those he cares about. He has a strong sense of justice and is not afraid to speak his mind, even if it means going against the status quo.

**Interests:**
Nils is an avid outdoorsman with a passion for hiking, rock climbing, and sailing. He finds solace in nature and often spends hours lost in thought while surrounded by trees or the ocean. Music is also a significant interest of his; he plays the guitar and composes his own songs, which often reflect his introspective and poetic side.

**Additional Details:**
Nils has a small tattoo of a compass on his left forearm, symbolizing his love for navigation and exploration. He's fluent in three languages: Swedish, Norwegian, and English. Despite his rugged exterior, Nils has a soft spot for children and animals, which often surprises those who know him.
