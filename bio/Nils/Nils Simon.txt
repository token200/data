Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Nils Simon:

**Personality:** Nils appears to be a introspective and emotional person who has struggled with grief and guilt since his younger brother's tragic death. He is likely still grappling with these emotions, but seems to be on the path to healing and acceptance. His interactions with his mother suggest that he is affectionate and caring towards those close to him, although his distant relationship with his family may have contributed to this.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Average or slightly above average height (not specified in the original story)
* Eye Color: Blue eyes (implied by the mention of "eyes scanning the small town" in a way that suggests blue eyes are a distinctive feature)

**Interests:** Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that Nils is interested in:

* Nature and the outdoors (he notices details about the natural world, such as sunlight filtering through shutters and vibrant flowers)
* Family history and heritage (he helps his mother sort through Grandma's belongings and reminisces about past summers together)
* Personal growth and healing (he is drawn to the idea of finding peace and letting go of the past)

Additional details that could be added to flesh out Nils' character:

* Age: Late 20s or early 30s, although this is not explicitly stated
* Occupation: It is possible that Nils has a job in the city, given his initial departure from LÃ¥ngban and his recent return. However, he does not appear to be working on arrival.
* Personality quirks: Perhaps Nils has a habit of daydreaming or getting lost in thought when reflecting on painful memories, as hinted at by his introspection during conversations with his mother.

Overall, Nils appears to be a complex and nuanced character who is struggling to come to terms with his past while navigating a newfound sense of purpose and connection to his family.
