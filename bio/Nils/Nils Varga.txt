As such, we can imagine him to be around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with an athletic build that reflects his scrappy lifestyle on the streets. His eye color is not explicitly mentioned, but considering his dark and moody demeanor, it's likely that he has piercing brown or hazel eyes.

**Personality:**
Nils is a sensitive soul who has been shaped by his experiences as an orphan and an outcast. He is fiercely independent and resourceful, having had to rely on himself for survival in the harsh world of foster care and homelessness. However, this resilience also makes him guarded and cautious, taking time to trust others. Nils is deeply empathetic and understanding, drawn to those who are struggling and seeking acceptance. His sense of humor is dry and sarcastic, often serving as a coping mechanism.

**Interests:**
Nils has an affinity for words, literature, and dreams. He devours books from the local library, immersing himself in worlds of fantasy and adventure. This love of reading allows him to escape the harsh realities of his life and find solace in the stories and characters that transport him to different realms. As he becomes more confident in his place within the community center group, Nils also develops an interest in music, particularly classical music, which resonates with Rainer's passion.
