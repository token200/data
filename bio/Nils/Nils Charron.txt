Based on the short story, here's a summary of Nils Charron's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nils appears to be introspective and nostalgic, with a strong connection to his family's past. He is driven by a desire for closure and understanding, which suggests that he is emotionally resilient but also intensely emotional. His willingness to confront his demons and face the unknown implies that he is determined and courageous.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide explicit details about Nils' physical appearance beyond what's mentioned in relation to his father. However, it can be inferred that he has inherited some of his father's rugged qualities, such as a strong presence or a weathered face. It would be reasonable to imagine him with:

* Height: around 5'10" (178 cm) - tall enough to be imposing but not too towering.
* Eye Color: Blue or green eyes, perhaps a shade reminiscent of the Scandinavian sky that Nils grew up in.

**Interests:** Based on his actions and emotions throughout the story, it's likely that Nils is interested in:

* His family's history and legacy
* The stories and memories of his childhood home
* Self-discovery and introspection
* Perhaps even farming or agricultural work, given his father's profession

These interests are centered around nostalgia, self-awareness, and understanding the past, which suggests that Nils is someone who values tradition and heritage but also seeks to learn from their experiences.
