Here is a summary of Nils Andersson's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Nils is an introspective and emotional individual with a deep connection to history and its stories. He has a strong sense of empathy and can form bonds with people and objects from different eras and cultures. His curiosity and passion for discovery drive him to explore the past, and he is not afraid to dig into complex and sensitive topics. Nils also appears to be fiercely loyal to those who have passed on and dedicated to preserving their memories.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, we can infer that Nils Andersson is likely a mature individual in his 50s or 60s, given his experience as a proprietor of an antique shop for many years. He is described as sitting at his desk, surrounded by dusty books and papers, which suggests that he values knowledge and research over physical appearance. Assuming Nils has been around for a while, we can estimate that he stands around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with grey or dark brown hair, possibly starting to show some wisps of white at the temples.

**Eye Color:** As someone who is deeply focused on his work and often lost in thought, Nils likely has eyes that are warm and introspective. Given the Scandinavian origins hinted at in the story (Lena's name suggests Swedish roots), it is possible that Nils' eye color is blue or grey-blue, reflecting the common eye colors found in Nordic countries.

**Interests:** Nils' primary interest is collecting and preserving historical artifacts and stories, which drives his work as a proprietor of Andersson's Antiques. He is deeply invested in uncovering the secrets and emotions behind each object he finds, often feeling an inexplicable connection to the people or events associated with them. This passion for history extends beyond mere collecting; Nils strives to share these stories and preserve memories through writing, research, and conservation.

Additionally, it can be inferred that Nils is:

* A writer or researcher at heart
* An empathetic listener
* Dedicated to preserving cultural heritage
* Enthusiastic about historical research and archival work
