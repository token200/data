Norbert is also a man of few words, preferring to listen more than speak, but when he does share stories or offer advice, it's always accompanied by a wry smile.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet (183 cm) - a tall and imposing figure that commands respect.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at. His gaze is both intense and piercing, reflecting the years of training as an assassin.

Despite his newfound peaceful life, Norbert still has an undercurrent of restlessness, a reminder that his past as an assassin will forever be a part of him.
