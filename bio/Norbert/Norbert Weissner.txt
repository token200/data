Here is a short summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Norbert Weissner:

**Physical Attributes:**
Norbert Weissner stands at an unassuming 5'9" (175 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those who dare approach him. His hair is dark brown, often neatly combed and styled in a way that adds to his mild-mannered librarian appearance. He has a slender build, but there is an air of quiet intensity about him that belies any physical frailty.

**Personality:**
Norbert Weissner is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. By day, he appears to be a mild-mannered librarian, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispered conversations with patrons seeking refuge from the world outside. However, as night falls and the library's fluorescent lights flicker to life, Norbert transforms into The Keeper of Lost Knowledge - a guardian of secrets that have been hidden for centuries. He is an enigmatic figure with an unnerving intensity, a piercing gaze that seems to see right through those who approach him. Despite this, there is a quiet warmth about him, as if the very heart of knowledge itself has found expression in this strange, troubled man.

**Interests:**
As The Keeper of Lost Knowledge, Norbert Weissner's interests are centered around uncovering hidden texts, forgotten lore, and ancient artifacts. He is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to understand the mysteries of the universe. He is also deeply passionate about collecting and preserving knowledge, often going to great lengths to acquire and protect rare and valuable materials.

It's worth noting that Norbert's interests extend beyond his work as The Keeper. He has a deep love for literature, history, and philosophy, which serves as a foundation for his vast collection of knowledge. As Dr. Rachel Lee discovers in the story, Norbert's true interests lie in sharing this knowledge with those who are worthy, rather than simply accumulating it for personal gain.
