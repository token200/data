However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a depth of emotion and a fierce inner intensity that makes him both captivating and intimidating. Norbert is a listener, someone who absorbs the stories and emotions of others with an uncanny ability to understand their hidden meanings.

**Interests:**
Norbert's fascination with the mysterious and unknown drives many of his actions. He collects memories as he travels, which suggests a deep connection to the concept of remembrance and the power of recollections.

Additionally, Norbert's affinity for tools and machinery hints at an underlying mechanical aptitude, possibly inherited from his father or mentor in the circus world. His love for tinkering with devices may also be connected to his interest in memories, as if he sees them as intricately woven patterns that can be repaired, maintained, or even reassembled.

Norbert's passion for collecting memories and weaving magic over Ravenswood is not fully understood, but it suggests a person driven by curiosity, intuition, and an unshakeable sense of wonder.
