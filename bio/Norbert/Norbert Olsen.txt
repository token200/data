Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Norbert Olsen:

**Personality:** Norbert Olsen is a complex and introspective individual. On one hand, he is a seasoned fisherman with a no-nonsense attitude, built from decades at sea. He exudes confidence and competence in his work. However, his personal life has been marred by tragedy, leaving him with a deep sense of loss and a lingering sense of melancholy. Norbert's drive to set sail again is motivated by a desire to leave memories behind and find solace in the thrill of the hunt. Despite this, he is fiercely protective of those he loves, particularly his son Sander.

**Physical Attributes:** Norbert Olsen is a ruggedly handsome man in his 60s, standing at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, reflecting his Scandinavian heritage. He has a weathered complexion, earned from years spent under the Norwegian sun and salt spray. His graying hair is often worn long and unruly, framing his face with a rough-hewn charm.

**Interests:** Norbert's passions lie in fishing, sailing, and the open sea. As an accomplished fisherman, he has a deep respect for the ocean and its rhythms. He is also driven by a sense of adventure and a desire to explore the unknown. His love of navigation and cartography is evident in his ownership of "Morgenlysken," which serves as both his livelihood and a personal vessel for exploration. Beyond these interests, Norbert has a strong connection to his heritage and culture, particularly the rich maritime traditions of Norway.

It's worth noting that Norbert's character has been influenced by the story, but some attributes were left out in the original text or implied through context, so it was necessary to fill those gaps with imagination.
