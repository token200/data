Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Norbert Carlburg:

**Personality:** Norbert Carlburg is a driven and passionate individual with an insatiable curiosity for innovation and science. He has a humble demeanor despite his growing fame, often coming across as modest and self-deprecating. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a hint of pride and ego, which can sometimes get in the way of his relationships with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Norbert stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with an unassuming build that belies his genius-level intellect. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue, almost electric in their intensity. His hair is unkempt and brown, often sticking out from under his goggles or messy lab coat. He has a scattering of scruff on his chin, giving him a slightly rugged look.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Norbert's primary interest lies in inventing and tinkering. He spends most of his days (and nights) working on various projects, often at the expense of sleep or social interactions. His passion for science is evident in his extensive library of texts on quantum physics, neuroscience, and engineering. When not working on a new device, Norbert enjoys reading about theoretical breakthroughs and attending lectures on cutting-edge technology.

In addition to his professional interests, Norbert has a soft spot for cats, which inspired his toaster invention that prints out toast in feline shapes. He also seems to appreciate the company of Mrs. Jenkins, his neighbor who often visits him with her skepticism and curiosity about his inventions.
