Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the fictional character Saara Salvini:

**Physical Attributes:**
Saara is likely an attractive woman, but no specific details are mentioned regarding her height. Her eye color is not specified either, but considering she is described as perceiving details and having "trained eyes," it's possible that she has piercing or dark-colored eyes that complement her dark hair.

**Personality:**
Saara appears to be a determined, analytical, and introspective individual with a strong sense of justice. As a retired detective, she possesses a keen observational skillset and an ability to piece together fragments of information. She is also shown to be emotionally vulnerable, as evident in her lingering thoughts about the case that still haunts her.

**Interests:**
As hinted at throughout the story, Saara's interests revolve around solving mysteries and uncovering hidden stories. Her passion for coffee-making and serving pastries to local artists and intellectuals suggests that she values simplicity, community, and sharing experiences with others. At night, her mind is preoccupied with piecing together fragments of cases from her past, indicating a strong desire to resolve unresolved conflicts.

**Background:**
As mentioned in the story, Saara is a retired detective from Milan who was unable to solve a high-profile case involving a young girl's disappearance. Her decision to leave behind this unsolved case and start anew in Rome implies that she may be trying to escape personal or professional guilt, as well as seeking redemption.

**Age:**
Given her experience as a detective and the narrative tone of the story, it is likely that Saara Salvini is an older woman in her mid-to-late 40s or early 50s.

**Height:** Assuming she is not unusually tall or short for her age group, Saara's height could be around 5'6" (168 cm) to 5'8" (173 cm), though this remains speculative without direct confirmation from the text.
