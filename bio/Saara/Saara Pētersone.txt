**Physical Attributes:** Saara stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a loose braid or ponytail that showcases her bright hazel eyes. Her style is eclectic, reflecting her love of both traditional Latvian clothing and modern streetwear.

**Interests:** Saara's interests extend far beyond music. She is deeply passionate about preserving traditional Latvian folk culture, particularly through the accordion, which was taught to her by her grandmother. In addition to her musical talents, she enjoys trying new recipes in the kitchen (her favorite being her grandmother's meat pies) and exploring the city of Riga.

It's worth noting that I made up Saara's eye color (hazel) as it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the original story.
