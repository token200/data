Here is a summary of Rafael Wójcik's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Rafael Wójcik stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His striking features include piercing green eyes, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy swoop, and a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident. He has a subtle tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist, which he obtained during his rebellious teenage years.

**Personality:**
Rafael is an enigmatic and introspective individual with a unique perspective on life. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo in both his art and personal relationships. His wit is dry and sarcastic, and he has a tendency to hide behind a mask of mystery, making it difficult for others to penetrate his defenses. Despite this, those who do get close to him are rewarded with a deep sense of loyalty and empathy.

**Interests:**
Rafael's passions lie at the intersection of art, music, and philosophy. He is an avid reader of existentialist literature and often finds inspiration in the works of Camus, Nietzsche, and Kafka. His favorite artists include Pollock, Kandinsky, and Miró, whose innovative techniques resonate with his own avant-garde style. When not creating art, Rafael can be found lost in the city's underground music scene, attending experimental concerts and improvisational performances that fuel his creative spirit.

**Habits:**
Rafael has a habit of disappearing during critical moments of stress or anxiety, only to reappear when the situation has passed. He is also prone to cryptic messages and riddles, which he uses to communicate with those closest to him. Despite this, he is deeply rooted in his relationships and values honesty above all else.

**Quirks:**
Rafael has a fascination with ancient mysticism and occult practices, often incorporating elements of these into his art and spiritual exploration. He is also an avid collector of rare books on mysticism and philosophy, which he spends hours pouring over in search of hidden truths.
