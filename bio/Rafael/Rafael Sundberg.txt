**Personality:** Rafael Sundberg appears to be a determined and driven individual. As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of darkness and has been driven by his personal quest to find out what happened to his sister, Lena. He is also shown to be resourceful and intelligent, having spent years tracking down leads and following tips.

Outside of work, it can be assumed that Rafael is interested in:

* Journalism: Given his sister's career as a journalist, Rafael may have an interest in journalism or investigative reporting.
* Corruption and injustice: As he has spent years tracking down leads on high-profile corruption cases, Rafael likely has a strong sense of justice and is driven to uncover the truth.
* Personal relationships: Rafael's connection to Sofia, Lena's best friend, suggests that he values his personal relationships and may be particularly invested in finding out what happened to his sister.
