Let's go with the first option and create a new story around the character Rafael Bērziņa.

Here's a summary of Rafael Bērziņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Rafael Bērziņa is a 25-year-old man with an athletic build. He stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall and has short, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy manner. His bright blue eyes are fringed with thick lashes, giving him an endearing appearance. He has a scattering of light freckles across the bridge of his nose, which adds to his charm.

**Personality:**
Rafael is a free-spirited individual with a passion for adventure and exploration. He's fiercely independent, having spent much of his childhood traveling with his family between various European countries. This upbringing has instilled in him a love for different cultures, languages, and traditions. Rafael is confident, outgoing, and always up for trying new experiences, but he can also be introverted at times, preferring to observe and listen rather than dominate conversations.

**Interests:**
Rafael is an avid traveler, photographer, and writer. He has a deep appreciation for history, philosophy, and science fiction, often devouring books on these subjects in his free time. His love for photography takes him to the great outdoors, where he captures stunning landscapes and portraits of people from diverse backgrounds. Rafael also enjoys playing guitar and singing folk music, often writing his own lyrics inspired by life's experiences.

With this character profile, I can now create a short story or continue with the original prompt if you'd like!
