Here is a summary of the fictional character Marco Michalska:

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel
- Hair Color: Dark Brown, often worn neatly trimmed and slightly unkempt for a more intellectual look.
- Build: Lean but strong, with a slight build that suggests regular physical activity despite his somewhat sedentary work as a historian.

**Personality:** 
Marco Michalska is an extremely intelligent, driven individual who is deeply passionate about history. He has a contagious enthusiasm for discovery and often gets lost in the depths of ancient texts. While Marco can come across as slightly obsessive to those around him, especially when it comes to uncovering the truth about historical figures like Sir Edward, he ultimately sees this passion as a driving force that fuels his pursuit of knowledge.

He is very curious, always on the lookout for new information and clues, which at times can lead him down complex paths. His colleagues might joke about Marco's "love for coffee" in comparison to his love for history, but those close to him know that this love for history extends far beyond any other passion he has.

**Interests:** 
- History (specifically medieval European history)
- Researching and uncovering hidden gems or lost knowledge
- Traveling to places of historical significance
- Collecting rare books, scrolls, or ancient artifacts related to his field of study
- Brewing coffee (especially in large quantities)

Marco's love for these interests drives much of the narrative in his story. His insatiable curiosity about Sir Edward and his quest for truth make him a compelling character who embodies both intellectual curiosity and determination.
