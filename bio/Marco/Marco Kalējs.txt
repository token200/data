Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Marco KalÄ“js' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Marco is a man of few words, with a rugged exterior and an introspective nature. He seems to be driven by a sense of longing and restlessness, which suggests that he may have unresolved emotions or unmet desires. Despite his tough exterior, he appears vulnerable when confronted with his own secrets and doubts.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of gold
- Hair: Black, with a wild texture that gets tousled by the wind

Interests: Chess seems to be a significant interest for Marco, as hinted at in the story. He is described as having an "unorthodox style" and making daring attacks on the chessboard. This suggests that he may have a competitive spirit and enjoys pushing himself to new limits.

It's also possible that Marco has an interest in exploring his past and uncovering hidden secrets about himself, given the encounter with the old woman who seems to understand him better than anyone else. The story implies that Marco is on a journey of self-discovery, seeking answers to his own questions and searching for something more fulfilling than his current accomplishments.

Additional interests or hobbies can be inferred, such as:
- Outdoor activities like hiking or exploring vast spaces (as seen in the scene with the Grand Canyon)
- Contemplation and introspection (as evident from his moment of solitude at the edge of the canyon)
- Possibly, philosophical or spiritual pursuits (given the mystical encounter with the old woman)

Keep in mind that these are just inferences based on a limited passage, and more information about Marco's character could be explored to deepen our understanding of him.
