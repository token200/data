Here's a summary of Marco Boulanger's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Marco stands at 5'9" with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are a deep, soulful blue that seem to hold a world of emotions. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Marco is a quiet and introspective person who has learned to navigate the constant barrage of thoughts in his mind through self-imposed isolation. Despite this, he is deeply empathetic and understanding, often putting others' needs before his own. As a result, Marco can come across as introverted or even aloof, but those who get to know him soon discover that he has a dry sense of humor and a deep love for music, literature, and philosophy.

**Interests:**
Marco's primary interest is escaping the cacophony in his mind through reading, listening to music, and exploring philosophical ideas. He is particularly drawn to literary classics, poetry, and music from the 1960s and 1970s. When he's not lost in thought or absorbed in a good book, Marco enjoys practicing piano and playing guitar, often losing himself in the melodies and chord progressions.

As his relationship with Sophia deepens, Marco becomes increasingly fascinated by her unique gift and the possibilities it presents for understanding and connecting with others like themselves.
