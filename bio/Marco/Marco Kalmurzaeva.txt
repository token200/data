**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of auburn in the right light
* Skin Tone: Olive, with a warm undertone from spending time outdoors

**Personality:**
Marco is an introverted yet fiercely loyal individual. He's a problem-solver who tends to think ahead, often anticipating potential outcomes before they happen. His quiet confidence and analytical mind make him an asset in professional settings, but he sometimes struggles with expressing his emotions openly. Despite this, Marco has a dry sense of humor that surfaces when he's around people he trusts.

**Interests:**

* Hiking and outdoor activities
* Reading historical fiction and non-fiction books
* Playing the guitar (he's been learning for years but still dreams of becoming a skilled musician)
* Cooking (specifically, experimenting with Russian cuisine)
