Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Clement Vasiliev:

**Personality:** Clement is a charismatic and intelligent master thief and con artist. He possesses exceptional wit, charm, and cunning, which he uses to manipulate people and situations to achieve his goals. Despite his initial reputation as "The Fox of St. Petersburg," Clement has a softer side and can be kind, compassionate, and genuine when the situation calls for it. However, he is also fiercely independent and guarded, having learned to rely only on himself in order to survive.

**Physical Attributes:** Clement stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often styled with a bit of messiness that adds to his charming, rogue-like appearance. His eyes are piercing green, a trait he inherited from his mother's side of the family. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from one of his earlier escapades.

**Interests:** Clement is an avid collector of rare and valuable items, often incorporating them into his heists or using them to negotiate with other thieves. He also has a fascination with historical artifacts and cultural relics, which drew him to the Russian Museum in the first place. Outside of his love for thievery and adventure, Clement enjoys playing chess, reading classical literature, and attending opera performances.

It's worth noting that while Clement is an expert thief and con artist, he doesn't necessarily enjoy the thrill of stealing or the camaraderie that comes with being part of a thieves' guild. His primary motivation is often driven by curiosity, a desire to uncover hidden secrets and treasures, rather than purely financial gain.
