Here's a summary of the fictional character Stanisław Corberó:

**Physical Attributes:**
Stanisław Corberó stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming yet striking presence. His eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, a deep, almost purple hue that seems to hold a world of secrets within them. His hair is dark and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in tangled locks that add to the enigmatic aura surrounding him.

**Personality:**
Stanisław Corberó is a complex individual shrouded in mystery. He appears introspective and brooding, lost in thought as he works on his latest masterpiece. Despite the whispers of occult connections, he seems oblivious to the rumors, too engrossed in his own creative world to care about external expectations. There's an air of intensity surrounding him, a sense that he's tapping into something primal and raw, yet simultaneously struggling to maintain control over his dark impulses.

**Interests:**
Stanisław Corberó is consumed by his art, pouring every shred of sanity – or madness – into his paintings. He finds solace in the darkness, letting it seep into his canvases like a palpable force that courses through his veins. His passion for painting is matched only by his fascination with the unknown, the unseen forces that drive him to create. In those fleeting moments when he breaks free from his studio's grasp, he revels in the simple pleasures of life: the feel of the fog on his skin, the twisted forms of nature reflected in the grey sea.

His interests extend beyond art and the occult, hinting at a deep love for the mysteries of existence. There's an unspoken longing to unravel the enigmas that surround him, to grasp the darkness that binds him, yet also to harness its creative potential.
