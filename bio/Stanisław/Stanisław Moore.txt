His work has taken him down a rabbit hole of research, experimentation, and innovative thinking, earning him both recognition and skepticism from his peers.

**Additional Details:** Stanisław is an avid collector of rare books, particularly those on astronomy and physics. He spends hours pouring over ancient texts and manuscripts in search of new knowledge.
