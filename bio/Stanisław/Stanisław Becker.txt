His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait he inherited from his Eastern European heritage. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, and his thick beard adds to his rugged appearance.

**Personality:** Stanisław Becker is a resourceful and independent individual with a strong sense of self-reliance. He has a dry wit and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. Despite this, he has a deep sense of loyalty and justice, which drives him to take on odd jobs and investigate suspicious occurrences. Stanisław is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to unexpected situations.

**Interests:** Before becoming an adventurer, Stanisław Becker was an accomplished engineer with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. He has a strong interest in history, particularly the forgotten places he's encountered during his travels. In his downtime, he enjoys reading about cryptography, codes, and ciphers – skills that have proven invaluable in his recent encounters with shadowy figures.

Stanisław's experiences as an adventurer have also given him a deep respect for the natural world and a strong connection to the land. He has a quiet reverence for the old windmills and waterways he's explored, and he finds solace in their beauty and power.

The mysterious events that unfolded in the small village in Eastern Europe have left Stanisław with more questions than answers – and a growing sense of unease about his own identity and purpose.
