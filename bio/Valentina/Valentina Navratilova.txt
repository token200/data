Since Martina Navratilova is the correct name, I will provide a fictional summary with made-up details inspired by her story:

Meet Valentina Navratilova, a fictional tennis sensation. 

Valentina stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with striking blue-green eyes that seem to sparkle on court. Her short, spiky hair is often styled in a bold, asymmetrical fashion that accentuates her athletic features.

Off the court, Valentina exudes confidence and charisma, reflecting her strong sense of self. She's an avid animal lover and passionate advocate for environmental conservation, often using her platform to raise awareness about pressing issues affecting wildlife and ecosystems.

Valentina's background is steeped in activism and politics, with a deep commitment to social justice. Growing up in Prague, she was exposed to the complexities of Eastern European history, which instilled in her a strong sense of empathy and advocacy for marginalized communities.

As a tennis player, Valentina is known for her fierce competitiveness and unyielding work ethic. She's a natural competitor who thrives under pressure, often channeling her energy into charitable initiatives that support women's empowerment and LGBTQ+ rights.

In terms of interests, Valentina enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain balance in her life, as well as sampling new cuisines from around the world. Her artistic side is also expressed through her love of photography and graphic design, which she uses to create visually striking campaigns for social causes close to her heart.
