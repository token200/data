Here is a summary of the fictional character Valentina Hébert:

**Physical Attributes:** Valentina stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to deepen in color when she's deeply lost in thought or concentrating on her music. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a messy bun when she's performing.

**Personality:** Valentina has an introspective and creative personality, with a deep passion for music and the arts. She's intensely focused and driven, willing to sacrifice her own needs and desires for the sake of her craft. Her love for Debussy's "Clair de Lune" set off a chain reaction of obsessive behavior, but this trait has also served her well in her pursuit of artistic perfection. Despite her dedication, Valentina is not unfeeling or detached; she has a deep emotional intelligence and is empathetic towards those around her.

**Interests:** As a pianist, Valentina's primary interest lies in music and the piano itself. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of various styles, periods, and repertoire, often seeking out forgotten melodies to incorporate into her performances. Her love for Debussy and Satie is rivaled only by her fascination with the poetry of Aurélien Dumont and other literary figures who inspire her music. In quieter moments, Valentina enjoys exploring the natural beauty surrounding Annecy, finding solace in the majesty of the Alps.

**Other Traits:** Given her upbringing in a musical household, Valentina has an innate sense of harmony and melody that often influences her interactions with others. Her love for Aurélien Dumont brought new depth to her performances, but also made her more introspective and self-aware.
