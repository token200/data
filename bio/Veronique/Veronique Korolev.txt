However, beneath her reserved exterior lies a fiercely competitive and driven personality that propels her forward in pursuit of the truth.

Veronique is intensely curious and has an insatiable appetite for knowledge, particularly when it comes to cryptography and coding theory.

Veronique's fascination with cryptography is matched only by her love of history and obscure knowledge. She has a particular fondness for forgotten ciphers and cryptograms that have been lost to the sands of time. Her work is driven by a desire to uncover hidden secrets and expose the truth, whether it be in the realm of codes or the complexities of human nature.

Despite her intense focus on her work, Veronique does have a soft spot for classical music and opera, often finding solace in the beauty and complexity of these art forms.
