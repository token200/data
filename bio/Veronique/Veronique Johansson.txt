Despite being detached in public, she is perceptive and insightful, often sensing the discomfort or unease that her art inspires.

**Physical Attributes:** Veronique stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those around her, instilling a sense of introspection and self-reflection.

**Interests:** Veronique's interests lie at the intersection of art, politics, psychology, and social justice. She is fascinated by the ways in which human behavior and societal norms can be both beautiful and disturbing.
