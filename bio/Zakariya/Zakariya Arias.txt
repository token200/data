Here is a summary of Zakariya Arias' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zakariya is an introspective and reserved individual who prefers to keep a low profile despite being a member of a storied family. He is humble and unassuming, often overlooked in favor of his more boisterous predecessors. However, he is also intensely curious and driven to uncover the hidden patterns that govern reality. This curiosity stems from his desire to understand the world beyond the whispers and wary glances that follow his family name.

**Physical Attributes:** Zakariya stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of navigating the city's labyrinthine streets. His hair is dark brown, often worn in a messy style, and his eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his nocturnal adventures.

**Interests:** Zakariya is fascinated by the study of hidden patterns and the intricacies of reality. He spends most nights lost in the city's streets, observing the way the world operates and seeking to understand its underlying mechanisms. His interests also extend to the ancient art of elemental magic, though he approaches it with a more subtle and nuanced understanding than his predecessors. He is drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, often feeling an unsettling sense of disconnection from the more superficial aspects of life.

Despite his reserved nature, Zakariya has a deep sense of wonder and curiosity that drives him to explore the world beyond his family's legacy. His discovery at the secluded estate has set him on a path of self-discovery, one that will challenge everything he thought he knew about himself and his place in the world.
