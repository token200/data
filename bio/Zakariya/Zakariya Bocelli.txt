**Personality:** Zakariya is a free-spirited individual with a passion for creative expression. He's fiercely independent and values authenticity above all else. With a quick wit and sharp tongue, he can come across as confident and charismatic, but also has a vulnerable side that he only reveals to those closest to him.

**Interests:** Music is Zakariya's lifeblood, and he spends most of his free time exploring new sounds and styles. He's an avid collector of rare vinyl records and enjoys nothing more than listening to old-school jazz and blues in his downtime.
