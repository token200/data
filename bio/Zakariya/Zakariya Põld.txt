Based on the story provided, I've created a summary of the fictional character Zakariya Põld:

**Physical Attributes:**

His hair is dark brown, often tied back in a simple knot, and his eyes are a deep shade of blue, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea on a clear summer day.

**Personality:**
Zakariya is an introverted yet deeply compassionate individual who finds solace in the natural world. He possesses a quiet confidence that comes from spending countless hours tending to his garden and perfecting his craft as a woodcarver. Zakariya's dedication to his work is unwavering, and he is willing to spend hours under the full moon imbuing his carvings with mystical energy. Despite his reserved nature, he exudes a sense of kindness and wisdom that earns him the respect and admiration of those around him.

**Interests:**
Zakariya's passions are deeply rooted in nature and the traditional Estonian crafts of gardening and woodcarving. He spends most of his days tending to his lush garden, experimenting with rare herbs and vegetables, and perfecting his wooden talismans under the light of the full moon. Zakariya is also drawn to the ancient traditions and myths of Estonia, which he believes hold secrets about the natural world and its hidden patterns. He sees himself as a guardian of these ancient knowledge, and his work serves as a connection to the mystical heartbeat of the land.

**Additional Details:**
Zakariya's eyes sparkle with curiosity when he is among rare plants or wooden carvings, and he often finds himself lost in thought as he contemplates the mysteries of the forest.

As a result, he continues to tend his garden, shape wooden talismans, and listen to the whispers of the ancient spirits, allowing himself to grow as a person and an artisan with each passing year.
