**Personality:** Nurim is a creative and driven individual with a passion for art. She is dedicated, hardworking, and willing to take risks to pursue her dreams. Her excitement and nervousness are palpable as she watches her audience respond to her work, showcasing her emotional depth and connection to her art.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
