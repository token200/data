Nurym is also intensely focused and willing to take calculated risks when necessary, driven by a burning need to uncover the secrets that lie beneath the surface of the desert sands.

Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for lost causes and underdogs, often going out of her way to help those in need or protect the vulnerable. This compassionate side is tempered by her unwavering commitment to her own goals, which can sometimes put her at odds with others who seek to claim the treasure for themselves.
