**Background:**
Nurym was born in a small coastal town in Spain, where she grew up surrounded by the sound of the sea and the warmth of her family's kitchen. She spent much of her childhood exploring the rocky shores and learning about the importance of conservation from her father, a marine biologist. Nurym's love for music began with her grandfather's old guitar, which he passed down to her when she was just a teenager.
