**Personality:** Nurym appears to be determined, passionate, and creative. She has a strong sense of self-determination, as evidenced by her decision to leave her village behind and pursue an apprenticeship as a woodcarver in the city. She is also open to new experiences and willing to take risks, as seen in her willingness to step off the train into an unfamiliar station.

- Eye Color: The text does not mention Nurym's eye color specifically. However, considering her Slavic heritage (mentioned in the story about her village on the outskirts of a country), one could assume that she has blue or green eyes.
- Other Physical Attributes: There is no detailed description of Nurym's physical appearance beyond her height and eye color.
