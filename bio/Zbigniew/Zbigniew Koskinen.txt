Zbigniew Koskinen is a quiet and introverted individual who prefers to keep to himself. He is meticulous and detail-oriented, often losing himself in the intricacies of mechanical systems and musical compositions. Despite his reclusive nature, Zbigniew has a deep sense of loyalty and justice, which motivates him to help those in need and provide expert repair services to his clients. His passion for music is a key aspect of his personality, bringing out a creative and expressive side that he only reveals to those closest to him.

**Hobbies:**
Outside of work, Zbigniew enjoys spending time with Mrs. Jenkins, his neighbor who encouraged him to share his music with the world. He also values the quiet, meditative moments he spends alone, often sitting at his workbench or listening to classical music to clear his mind and focus his thoughts.
