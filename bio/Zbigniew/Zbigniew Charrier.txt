Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Zbigniew Charrier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zbigniew is portrayed as a complex character with a mix of traits. He appears to be a man who values simplicity and peace, having grown tired of the constant travel and danger associated with his past life as a spy. However, when confronted with the mysterious woman's information about an old mission, he becomes increasingly drawn back into his espionage world, suggesting that beneath his tranquil exterior lies a deep-seated passion for action and intrigue.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no detailed physical attributes are mentioned in the story. Based on the context provided, I can only make some educated guesses:

* Height: Late 50s or early 60s (based on the description of him as a retired spy who has grown tired)
* Eye Color: Blue or gray (typical colors associated with European men, and consistent with the French setting)

**Interests:** As revealed in the story, Zbigniew's interests appear to be:

* Simple pleasures: He finds contentment in quiet moments, sipping coffee at his favorite caf√© while watching the sun rise over the vineyards.
* Spy craft: His past as an intelligence agency operative is still relevant, and he seems drawn back into this world when confronted with old memories and unfinished business.
