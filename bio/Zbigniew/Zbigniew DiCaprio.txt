I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zbigniew DiCaprio. It appears to be an error or misremembering of Leonardo DiCaprio's name.

However, if you'd like, I can create a fictional character profile for someone named Zbigniew DiCaprio based on the characteristics and interests mentioned in the short story about Leonardo DiCaprio:

In his free time, he enjoys reading classic literature, practicing yoga, and exploring new cuisines.

Please note that this character profile is entirely fictional and created based on the characteristics mentioned in the short story about Leonardo DiCaprio.
