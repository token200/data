**Name:** Zbigniew Shu-fen
**Age:** 28
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Hazel with golden flecks

**Personality:** Zbigniew is a free-spirited individual with a curious and adventurous nature. He's always been drawn to the unknown and has a knack for solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. His quick wit and sharp intellect make him a valuable asset in any situation, but he can also come across as introverted or aloof at times. Despite this, he has a deep sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.
