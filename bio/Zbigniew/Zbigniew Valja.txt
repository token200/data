Here's a summary of the fictional character Zbigniew "Zbi" Valja:

**Personality:** Zbigniew is a man of mystery with a dry sense of humor. He has an air of confidence and a hint of arrogance, which serves him well in his line of work as a former operative for the Polish Intelligence Service. Despite this, he seems to have a soft spot for those who are genuinely invested in uncovering the truth, like Anna Kowalska.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with a piercing quality that seems to see right through you
* Hair Color: Dark blond, often worn short and neat
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical training and high-stakes missions
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (a souvenir from a past encounter)

**Interests:** Zbigniew's interests seem to revolve around the art of surveillance and infiltration. He has an unparalleled ability to blend into his surroundings, making him an expert at reading people and situations. When not working, he appears to enjoy quiet nights in with a good book or a whiskey on the rocks. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep respect for those who operate outside the boundaries of conventional morality.

It's worth noting that Zbigniew's past is shrouded in mystery, and it's unclear what drives him or what motivates him. However, one thing is certain: he is a man with a wealth of experience and a keen instinct for survival.
