- Eye Color: Piercing blue, with an intensity that seems to bore into those he meets.
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and impeccably
- Build: Lean and fit, suggesting a disciplined lifestyle

**Personality:**
Zbigniew Dubois is a master strategist and diplomat known for his quiet confidence and air of mystery. He has an uncanny ability to remain calm under pressure, which serves him well in both high-stakes business deals and behind-the-scenes politics. His reserved demeanor belies a complex web of motivations and desires that he guards closely.

However, as the story progresses, Zbigniew Dubois is shown to be torn between his desire to outsmart Sophie and growing respect for her tenacity. This hint suggests that beneath his polished exterior lies an individual driven by ambition, possibly with a strong sense of justice or morality that surfaces under pressure.

**Interests:**
While the story doesn't explicitly outline Zbigniew Dubois's personal interests outside of business and politics, it can be inferred that he enjoys staying one step ahead of others. His cat-and-mouse game with Sophie suggests an intellectual challenge that appeals to him, possibly stemming from a desire for strategic competition.

Moreover, as the stakes grow higher and Zbigniew Dubois begins to question his own motivations, it's possible that he starts to explore more personal interests or philosophies that could counterbalance his driven personality.
