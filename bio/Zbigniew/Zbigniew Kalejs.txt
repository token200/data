Based on the fictional character Zbigniew Kalejs, here is a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Zbigniew Kalejs was a Polish-born Soviet spy and saboteur who worked for the Soviet Union's military intelligence agency, SMERSH. Personality-wise, Kalejs was known to be charismatic, calculating, and ruthless in his approach to espionage.

Physically, Kalejs was of average height, standing at around 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm). His eye color was a deep brown, which became one of his distinguishing features during his espionage career. He also had short, dark hair that he often styled neatly.

As for interests, Kalejs was reportedly fascinated by high-stakes poker games and was known to frequent exclusive underground gaming circles in Paris and other European cities. This fascination likely stems from his need for intense focus and calculation, skills that served him well in his espionage work.

Please note that while I have tried to provide a comprehensive summary based on publicly available information, some aspects of Kalejs' life may remain shrouded in mystery due to the clandestine nature of his activities.
