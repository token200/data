Here is a summary of Zbigniew Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zbigniew is a man of mystery with an aura of quiet confidence. He is introspective and guarded, having spent years navigating the complex web of international espionage. Despite this tough exterior, he has a soft spot for vulnerable people and is drawn to those who can see beyond his façade. As he opens up to Sophie, it becomes clear that he has a deep emotional wellspring, having lost loved ones in the line of duty.

**Physical Attributes:** Zbigniew stands at 6'1" (185 cm), with a lean yet athletic build that speaks to his years of espionage work. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up before making a decision. His chiseled features are accentuated by a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him a commanding presence.

**Interests:** Outside of his spy work, Zbigniew seems to enjoy the simple things in life. He is a coffee aficionado and can often be found sipping on a cup at the local café in Saint-Tropez. He also has a fondness for watching the sunset over the Mediterranean Sea, a habit that brings him both peace and melancholy.

It's worth noting that while Zbigniew's physical attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the original story, it is implied that he is a man who values his appearance and takes care of himself. However, beyond these surface-level details, little is known about his interests or hobbies outside of espionage.
