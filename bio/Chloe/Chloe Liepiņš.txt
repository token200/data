**Personality:** Chloe is a fiercely creative individual who isn't afraid to take risks. She's confident and determined, always striving for perfection. Despite the pressure from others to conform or compromise, she remains true to herself and her art. Her passion for urban art and self-expression often gets the better of her, causing her to work late into the night.

**Interests:** As a street artist, Chloe is deeply fascinated by the urban landscape and the stories it holds. She spends hours exploring Riga's hidden corners, searching for inspiration and connection with the city. Her artwork blends vibrant colors, abstract shapes, and bold patterns, reflecting her love of life, nature, and community.

Beyond art, Chloe enjoys social media and online platforms where she can connect with fans, share her creative process, and engage in meaningful conversations about art, identity, and self-expression.

Chloe is an advocate for empowering women in art and creativity, often participating in workshops, lectures, and panel discussions where she shares her experiences as a young artist. Her determination to prove herself in the face of adversity has inspired many aspiring artists and creatives.

When not working on a new mural or designing graphics, Chloe can be found practicing yoga or meditation, listening to indie folk music, and indulging in traditional Latvian cuisine (her love for food is just as strong as her love for art).
