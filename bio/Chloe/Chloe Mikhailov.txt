Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Chloe Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep, piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those she meets
* Hair Color: Dark, rich brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a subtle scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose

**Personality:**

Chloe is an intense and passionate individual, driven by a fierce desire to express herself through her art. She has a strong sense of self-awareness and is not afraid to explore the darker corners of her own psyche. Her intensity can sometimes be intimidating to those around her, but it also makes her incredibly focused and determined when pursuing her creative goals.

**Interests:**

* Art (particularly charcoal sketches and painting)
* Exploring the human condition through her work
* Philosophy and psychology (especially existentialism and psychoanalysis)
* Music (indie rock and experimental sounds seem to resonate with her artistic vibe)
* Reading (she devours books on art, philosophy, and psychology)

As an emerging artist, Chloe's work is a reflection of her own experiences and emotions. Her art often explores the tensions between reality and madness, and she seems drawn to themes that challenge her own perceptions of identity and self-expression.

The encounter with her doppelganger at the gallery exhibition sets off a chain reaction of introspection and creative reevaluation for Chloe, as she begins to question the boundaries between her inner world and outer reality.
