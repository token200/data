**Personality:** Aaro is a quiet and introverted person who has struggled to find her place in the small town where she grew up. She is described as "moodiness" which could imply that she has a complex or introspective nature. Despite this, she is also shown to be curious, determined, and creative, particularly when it comes to her art installation.

However, based on the context of the narrative, I would imagine Aaro to be a young adult with a slightly slender build and an unassuming demeanor. She likely has brown eyes, dark hair, and a warm, gentle smile.

As she researches the Harvest Festival, her interests become more focused on the town's heritage and cultural traditions. Her installation at the festival reflects this, combining traditional elements with her own unique vision.
