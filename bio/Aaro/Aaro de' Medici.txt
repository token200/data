Here's a summary of Aaro de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aaro is a driven and ambitious individual who yearns to forge his own path in life. He feels overshadowed by his father's grandeur and seeks recognition as an artist in his own right. Despite this, he is confident and charismatic, able to command respect from those around him. Aaro is also fiercely independent and determined, willing to take risks to pursue his passions.

**Physical Attributes:** Aaro stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build that belies his artistic inclinations. His piercing blue eyes are a striking feature, reflecting the intensity of his personality. His dark brown hair is neatly styled, often falling across his forehead in a way that accentuates his sharp features.

**Interests:** Aaro's primary interest lies in art, specifically fresco painting. He is fascinated by the technique and has spent countless hours studying the works of master artists like Botticelli. This commission from the Arte della Lana offers him the opportunity to showcase his skills and prove himself as a talented artist in his own right.

Additionally, Aaro is intrigued by politics and the inner workings of Florence's treacherous world of power struggles and patronage. He is well-versed in the art of diplomacy and has likely developed strong relationships with key figures in the city, including his sister Lucrezia.

Aaro's interests are not limited to art or politics alone; he also values family ties and close relationships. His bond with Lucrezia is particularly important to him, as she serves as a confidante and source of emotional support during times of uncertainty.
