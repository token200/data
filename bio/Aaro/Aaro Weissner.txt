**Interests:** As a sculptor, Aaro Weissner is deeply interested in exploring the human condition through art. He draws inspiration from the city itself, finding beauty in its duality of order and chaos. His work, particularly "Echoes in the Abyss," reflects this fascination with the ephemeral nature of human existence.
