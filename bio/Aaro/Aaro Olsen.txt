Here's a summary of the fictional character Aaro Olsen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Aaro is a tall and lean individual with an athletic build, likely due to his profession as a journalist. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) and has dark brown eyes that seem to bore into those he interviews. His hair is a dark blond color, often styled in a messy, piecey fashion.

**Personality:**
Aaro is a driven and resourceful individual with a keen mind for investigation. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to pursue stories that uncover the truth. He's also intensely curious, always seeking to learn more about his subjects and unravel the complexities of their lives.

Despite his tough exterior, Aaro has a soft spot for those in need, particularly women and children who are vulnerable to exploitation or abuse. His empathy and compassion often guide his journalistic pursuits, making him a fiercely tenacious advocate for those who have been overlooked or ignored by the authorities.

**Interests:**
Aaro's passions lie at the intersection of journalism, politics, and human rights. He's fascinated by the inner workings of Helsinki's organized crime scene and its connections to corruption, poverty, and social inequality.

In his free time, Aaro enjoys sipping coffee in dingy cafes (his favorite is Korkeakoski's), exploring Helsinki's lesser-known neighborhoods, and reading books on history, sociology, and psychology. He's also a self-taught historian with a particular interest in the cultural heritage of Finland, particularly its post-war era.

Aaro's sense of curiosity and adventure often takes him down dark alleys and into the shadows of the city, where he must rely on his wits, instincts, and determination to uncover the truth.
