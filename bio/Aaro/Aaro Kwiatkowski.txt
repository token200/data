Aaro Kwiatkowski is a private investigator in his mid-40s with an air of mystery surrounding him. Physically, he has a rugged yet lean build, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges persona.

Kwiatkowski's personality is shrouded in secrecy, but those who have encountered him can't help but be drawn to his intensity and focus. He has a keen eye for detail, which serves him well in his line of work. Despite his tough exterior, there is an underlying sense of vulnerability that hints at a deeper emotional complexity.

As for his interests, Kwiatkowski is an avid reader of true crime novels and philosophy books, often seeking to understand the darker corners of human nature. He has a passion for puzzles and cryptograms, which he believes helps him navigate the complex web of clues in his investigations. In his free time, he enjoys taking long walks alone at night, perhaps an attempt to replicate the feeling of being watched that always seems to precede a breakthrough in one of his cases.

It's worth noting that Kwiatkowski has a tendency to keep people at arm's length, which makes it difficult for others to get close to him. However, those who have managed to gain his trust can expect a fiercely loyal and dedicated ally. His dedication to uncovering the truth is unwavering, even when the stakes are high or the risks seem insurmountable.
