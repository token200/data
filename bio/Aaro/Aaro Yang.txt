Based on the short story, here's a summary of Aaro Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aaro is a complex and introspective person. She appears to be quiet and reserved, as evident from her sitting alone in her cluttered apartment with only soft light to illuminate her surroundings. However, beneath this exterior lies a determined and perceptive individual who has seen her fair share of crimes and mysteries. Her past experiences have shaped her into someone who is both fiercely independent and deeply driven by a sense of purpose.

**Physical Attributes:** Aaro is described as being surrounded by half-empty teacups and worn-out books, suggesting that she might be slightly disheveled or absent-minded. However, no specific details about her height or eye color are mentioned in the story. Let's assume that she is likely around 5'6" (168 cm) with dark brown eyes that seem to hold a depth of introspection.

**Interests:** Aaro appears to be deeply interested in art and perception, particularly the darker corners of Taipei's underworld. Her work as a detective often involves navigating these complex networks, but she is also driven by a desire to understand the power of perception itself. This curiosity about human perception and reality suggests that she might have a creative streak, which is hinted at through her sketchbook and fragmented drawings.

**Additional Details:** Aaro seems to be an introverted person who prefers to focus on her work rather than socializing. Her love for art and creativity suggests that she might appreciate the works of other street artists or avant-garde musicians. Additionally, her experiences with her parents' disappearance when she was a teenager have likely left emotional scars, which may contribute to her determined nature as a detective.

Overall, Aaro Yang is a nuanced and multi-faceted character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are shaped by her complex past and present experiences.
