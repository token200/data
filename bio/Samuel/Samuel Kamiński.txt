**Interests:** Samuel's primary interests revolve around mathematics, mysticism, and philosophy. He is particularly fascinated by the intersection of these subjects, often delving into complex concepts like chaos theory, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality. His passion for learning has led him to compile a vast collection of dusty tomes in his apartment, serving as a repository for his intellectual pursuits.
