Samuel's physical appearance reflects his introverted nature; he often dresses in understated, professional attire that allows him to blend into the background. However, there is a hint of ruggedness around the edges, suggesting a more complex individual beneath.

**Interests:** Samuel is deeply passionate about literature and publishing. He has a vast knowledge of books, authors, and literary movements, which he applies to his work in editing and publishing manuscripts. His love for words and stories drives him to seek out new talent and support emerging writers like Emma Taylor.

Beyond literature, Samuel's interests are relatively limited.
