Here is a summary of Samuel Dupont's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Samuel is a brooding and introspective individual, haunted by the memory of his sister's disappearance. He has a strong sense of justice and a determination to uncover the truth, no matter how long it takes. Despite his tough exterior, he appears to be vulnerable and emotionally raw, as hinted at in the caf√© owner's sympathetic remark about him not getting any younger.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Light brown
* Build: Slender, with a lean, athletic build from years of physical activity
* Age: Late 40s/Early 50s, possibly around 47-52 years old

**Interests:** As a former detective and private investigator, Samuel is deeply invested in solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. He has a keen mind for observation, analysis, and deduction, which serves him well in his line of work. On a personal level, he is driven by a desire to understand his sister's disappearance and to bring closure to their family's tragic story.

In terms of other interests, it can be inferred that Samuel enjoys reading (he is able to sit for long periods of time thinking) and possibly engaging in solitary activities such as meditation or writing. His profession also suggests that he values research, investigation, and problem-solving skills.

It's worth noting that the original story doesn't provide a lot of information about Samuel's background or personal life outside of his work as a detective/investigator, so some of these attributes may be subject to interpretation based on the provided text.
