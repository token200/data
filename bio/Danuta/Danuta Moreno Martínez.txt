**Personality:**
Danuta Moreno Martínez is a brilliant, reclusive detective with a complex and intriguing personality. She is fiercely determined and driven by a desire for justice and closure, which often clouds her judgment.

**Physical Attributes:**
Danuta is a woman of average height (around 5'8" or 173 cm), with long, dark hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a piercing brown that seem to bore into those she questions. Her features are strong and angular, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin.

Danuta's interests revolve around solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. She is an avid reader of detective novels and classic films noir, which has honed her analytical mind and razor-sharp wit.
