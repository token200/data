Based on the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Jose D'Annunzio:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm hazel with golden flecks, reminiscent of the Italian sun
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and slightly unkempt, framing his expressive face

**Personality:**

* Jose has a strong sense of identity rooted in his Italian heritage, which he often draws upon for inspiration. He is fiercely proud of his culture and values tradition, but also values individuality and self-expression.

**Interests:**
