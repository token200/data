He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, adding a touch of ruggedness to his otherwise refined features.

**Personality:**
Jose Xia is a complex and enigmatic individual with a rich inner world. On the surface, he appears charismatic and confident, but beneath this façade lies a warm and introspective person who is deeply passionate about his art. He is fiercely private and guarded, preferring to keep his personal life and emotions hidden from the world. Despite this, there is an undeniable sense of kindness and vulnerability in his eyes, which makes him approachable and relatable.

**Interests:**
Jose Xia is a Renaissance man with diverse interests that span multiple fields. Apart from art, he is deeply passionate about literature (particularly poetry and philosophy), music (classical and folk), and spirituality (Eastern and Western traditions). He is an avid reader, devouring books on psychology, history, and science to deepen his understanding of human nature and the world around him. When not creating art or reading, Jose can be found taking long walks in nature, observing the beauty of the world around him, and finding inspiration for his next masterpiece.

**Habits:**
Jose Xia is known for his disciplined routine, which includes early morning meditation sessions, a strict diet, and regular exercise to keep his body and mind agile. He has a love-hate relationship with technology, preferring to use traditional mediums like pencils, ink, and canvas to create his art. Despite his fame, Jose still spends hours observing the world around him, taking notes, and journaling his thoughts and feelings.

**Quirks:**
Jose Xia has an uncanny habit of collecting unusual objects and trinkets, which he incorporates into his artwork or keeps as mementos in his studio.
