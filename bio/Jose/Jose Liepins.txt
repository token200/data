Based on the short story about Jose Libenson, I have created a fictional character profile for a new character named Jose Liepins:

**Name:** Jose Liepins

**Age:** Late 40s/Early 50s

**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)

**Eye Color:** Dark Brown

**Personality:** Jose Liepins is a charismatic and introspective individual. He has a strong sense of justice and a deep empathy for those who have been wronged. Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and can be quite witty when the situation calls for it.

Jose is a natural leader, with a commanding presence that inspires confidence in those around him. However, he also values humility and discretion, preferring to work behind the scenes rather than seeking to draw attention to himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Jose has a strong build, honed from years of physical activity and outdoor pursuits. His dark brown eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. He often wears his hair slightly unkempt, giving him a rugged, outdoorsy appearance that belies his intelligence and wit.

**Interests:** Jose is an avid reader, particularly of classics and philosophical texts. He enjoys long walks in the woods, where he can clear his mind and reflect on life's complexities. He is also an accomplished musician, playing the guitar with great skill and passion.

In his free time, Jose likes to explore new places, whether it be a nearby city or a rural village. He has a deep appreciation for history and culture, often seeking out local museums and historical sites to visit.

Overall, Jose Liepins is a complex and multifaceted individual, with a rich inner life and a deep sense of purpose.
