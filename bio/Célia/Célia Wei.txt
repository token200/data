* Eye Color: Her eyes are an unusual shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to reflect the complexity and depth of her intellect.
* Hair: She has long, dark hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. The color is so deep it appears almost black, but it catches hints of blue in certain lighting conditions.

**Interests:** Célia's primary interest is quantum physics and unraveling its secrets. She spends most of her time researching and experimenting with theories on space-time manipulation.
