Here's a summary of Célia Kuznetsova's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Célia is a creative and introspective person. She has a deep connection with her art and is drawn to the vibrant energy of the city. She's also curious and determined, as seen in her relentless pursuit of capturing the elusive essence hidden beneath the surface of the city. Her conversations with Maria reveal that she's open-minded and receptive to new ideas, but also has a quiet confidence in her own vision.

**Physical Attributes:** Célia is described as having eyes that "seem to come alive behind the lens" when she takes pictures. This suggests that her eyes are expressive and intense, possibly with an piercing quality. Unfortunately, no other physical attributes are explicitly mentioned, so we can only make educated guesses. Based on the context, it's possible that Célia has long hair (mentioned in the scene where Maria is mesmerized by her eyes) and a slender build, which would allow her to move easily through the city streets.

Height: Given her ability to navigate narrow alleyways and climb into abandoned warehouses with ease, Célia may be slightly above average height, around 5'8" (173 cm).

Eye Color: Her piercing gaze is likely a deep shade of brown or green, which complements her artistic sensibilities.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Célia's primary interest lies in capturing the intricate patterns and textures that reveal themselves in urban landscapes. She's fascinated by the way light interacts with concrete and steel, creating hidden stories and meanings. Her obsession with uncovering the elusive essence of the city is driven by her artistic vision and desire to expose the beauty that often goes unseen.

Secondary interests include:

* Photography (obviously!)
* Street art
* Abandoned buildings and spaces
* Urban exploration
* Creative collaboration (her friendship with Maria showcases this interest)

Célia's interests are deeply intertwined, reflecting her curious and introspective nature. Her artistic pursuits drive her to explore the city in new and unexpected ways, seeking out hidden worlds and secrets waiting to be uncovered.
