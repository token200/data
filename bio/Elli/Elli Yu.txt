As she gets to know her sister Lena, however, Elli's guardedness begins to fade, revealing a more vulnerable side.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a neat and tidy bob

**Interests:** Elli Yu's primary interest is astrophysics, particularly black holes. She is fascinated by the behavior of miniature black holes and their potential applications for space exploration. In addition to her scientific pursuits, Elli also values intellectual pursuits, such as reading and learning new languages (she is fluent in English, Mandarin, and Spanish). When she has more free time, Elli enjoys spending nights gazing at the stars, lost in thought.

It's worth noting that while Lena Yu is not explicitly described as having physical attributes, it can be inferred from her description of Elli: "Lena had always been jealous of Elli's academic success and felt that she lived in her shadow."
