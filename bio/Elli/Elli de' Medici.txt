Here is a summary of Elli de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elli is a complex and introverted individual. On the surface, she appears to be a dutiful daughter and future member of her influential family, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep-seated desire for autonomy and self-expression. She is fiercely intelligent and curious, with a thirst for knowledge that extends beyond the realm of politics and social expectations. Elli's inner fire is undeniable, and she has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to question the status quo and challenge the norms set by her family.

**Physical Attributes:** Elli stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a modest bun, framing her heart-shaped face and expressive green eyes that sparkle with curiosity. Her features are delicate yet determined, reflecting the turmoil brewing beneath her polished exterior.

**Interests:** Elli's true passions lie in astronomy and philosophy. She spends countless hours poring over books on these subjects, seeking to understand the mysteries of the universe and find meaning in the vast expanse of space. Her fascination with the night sky is all-consuming, and she finds solace in the stars, which serve as a reminder that there is more to life than the societal expectations placed upon her.

It's worth noting that Elli's character is heavily influenced by her experiences and relationships, particularly with Leonardo. As she navigates her feelings for him, she begins to forge her own path, one that diverges from the traditional expectations of her family and society.
