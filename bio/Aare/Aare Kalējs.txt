Based on the short story provided, I will create a summary of Aare Kalējs' personality, physical attributes, and interests.

**Personality:**
Aare Kalējs is an enigmatic and mysterious individual with a calm and hypnotic presence. He possesses an uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings, making him all but invisible. Despite this, he has a profound impact on those around him, as seen in Līva's transformation after their encounter. Aare Kalējs seems to be a keeper of secrets, aware of the hidden threads that weave together the tapestry of life.

**Physical Attributes:**
Aare Kalējs is likely a tall individual, with an unlisted height but possibly around 6'2" (188 cm) or taller, allowing him to command attention without drawing it. His piercing blue eyes seem to be his most striking feature, radiating an otherworldly intensity that draws people in. He has chiseled features, which may suggest a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones, giving him a sculpted appearance. His dark hair is unkempt or styled in a way that complements his mysterious aura.

**Interests:**
Aare Kalējs appears to be fascinated by the hidden secrets of Riga and its inhabitants. He seems to possess an uncanny ability to understand the intricacies of human emotions and thoughts, allowing him to navigate the complex web of relationships and connections within the city. His interests may revolve around observing and learning from others, perhaps with a focus on the artistic and creative aspects of human expression.

Given this information, I would suggest that Aare Kalējs is an elusive and intriguing character who exists at the intersection of art, mystery, and the unknown. He seems to be drawn to those with a strong creative spark or an innate curiosity about the world around them, such as Līva in the short story.
