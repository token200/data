Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on the character "Aare del Toro" either. To create a fictional character with all the attributes you requested, I need some context or details about Aare del Toro.

Could you please provide me with some background information on Aare del Toro? Here are some questions to consider:

1. What genre of story would you like Aare del Toro to be in (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, adventure)?
2. Is Aare del Toro a protagonist or antagonist?
3. What is the character's personality like? Are they brave, intelligent, kind, or perhaps ruthless and cunning?
4. Do you have any specific physical attributes in mind for Aare del Toro (e.g., height, eye color, hair color, facial features)?
5. Are there any interests or hobbies that Aare del Toro enjoys or is passionate about?

Once I have this information, I'd be happy to help create a 400-word story about Aare del Toro!
