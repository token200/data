Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Inese García Márquez:

**Physical Attributes:**
Inese is a petite woman with an athletic build, standing at approximately 5'4" (162.56 cm). Her hair is dark brown and falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a simple ponytail. Her eyes are a deep shade of hazel, reminiscent of the earthy tones found in the jungle she loves so much. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, giving her an endearing and introspective appearance.

**Personality:**
Inese is a quiet and thoughtful individual, often lost in her own world of curiosity and discovery. She is deeply empathetic and cares deeply about the people and stories around her. As she delves into her family's history, Inese has developed a sense of determination and resilience, which serves as a foundation for her growing passion to learn more about her roots. Despite her reserved nature, Inese has a dry wit and can be fiercely independent when faced with challenges.

**Interests:**
Inese is an avid researcher and history buff, often spending hours pouring over old photographs, documents, and journals from her family's past. She has a special affinity for botany and natural history, which led to her discovery of the old trunk in the jungle. Inse is also drawn to photography and is known to take stunning shots of the tropical landscapes around Puerto Viejo de Talamanca. As she continues to explore her family's heritage, Inese hopes to one day become a journalist or historian herself, sharing the stories of those who came before her.

**Additional Traits:**
Inese speaks fluent Spanish, with a hint of Costa Rican accent, which sets her apart from those around her. She has a small tattoo of a quetzal, the national bird of Guatemala, on her left shoulder blade, symbolizing her connection to the region's rich cultural heritage.
