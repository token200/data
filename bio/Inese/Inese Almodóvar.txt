She's an avid reader, devouring books on psychology, philosophy, and history to deepen her understanding of the human experience. Her collection of dusty tomes is one of her most prized possessions, reflecting her love for knowledge and intellectual exploration.

In addition to reading, Inese enjoys taking long walks in nature, allowing herself to become lost in the rhythms of the natural world. She's drawn to the raw power of light and darkness, often incorporating elements of these opposing forces into her art. Music is another source of inspiration for her; she finds solace in the melodies of classical composers like Chopin and Debussy, which evoke a depth of emotion that resonates within her soul.
