Based on the short story, here is a summary of Łukasz Salonen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Łukasz Salonen is a complex and introspective individual. His piercing blue eyes hide a thousand secrets, suggesting that he has been through significant experiences that have shaped him into the person he is today. He appears to be haunted by his past as a former KGB agent, which has left emotional scars that still affect him. However, after re-exposing himself to his personal journal and confronting his demons with Hela's help, Łukasz shows signs of growth and redemption. He is determined to face his past and start anew, indicating a strong sense of resilience and hope for the future.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Facial Features: Chiseled, with sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline

It is not explicitly stated in the story what Łukasz's hair color or facial features look like. Based on his appearance as described in the story (like a superhero from a comic book), I have inferred that he likely has dark brown hair and chiseled features.

**Interests:**

* Writing (he kept a personal journal during his time in the KGB)
* Antiques (Łukasz visits Hela's antique shop and is drawn to old objects, suggesting an interest in history and nostalgia)

It is also implied that Łukasz is interested in facing his past and confronting his demons, as Hela encourages him to do so. This suggests that he is committed to personal growth and self-reflection.

Overall, Łukasz Salonen appears to be a multifaceted individual with a rich inner life and a complex history.
