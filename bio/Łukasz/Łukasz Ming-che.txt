**Personality:** ﾅ「kasz Ming-che appears to be an enigmatic figure shrouded in secrecy. He possesses an air of mystery, which can be unnerving to those around him. Despite his intimidating presence, he seems to possess a quiet confidence and an otherworldly intensity that sets him apart from others.

However, it's also suggested that Ming-che is driven by a desire to reclaim his lost heritage, indicating that he may be more complex than initially meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** ﾅ「kasz Ming-che's physical appearance is described as ambiguous, with no discernible Polish or Chinese features. He appears to be a blank slate, devoid of any defining characteristics that could identify his nationality.

However, it's worth noting that there are no direct descriptions of his height in the original story. To fill this gap, let's assume that Ming-che stands at around 6'2" (188 cm), a tall and imposing figure that commands attention without being overly intimidating.

His eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but given the otherworldly intensity associated with his gaze, it's possible to imagine him having piercing eyes that seem to see right through to the soul.

The map itself seems to hold great significance for Ming-che, as it leads him on a journey to hidden temples and secret courtyards. His ability to navigate these mystical realms suggests that he has an innate understanding of the esoteric and a desire to unlock the secrets of the universe.

In Kasia's company, Ming-che begins to craft new answers, suggesting that he is more interested in rediscovering truth than searching for it. This could indicate that his true interest lies not in uncovering specific facts but rather in reweaving the fabric of reality and creating a new understanding of the world around him.
