Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Alexander KissStanisław Fuentes:

**Physical Attributes:** Alexander is likely a tall and slender individual, with an athletic build that belies his cunning and intelligent nature. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) and has dark brown or black hair, which he often styles impeccably to match his sharp suits. His eye color is a deep, piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Alexander is a charismatic and confident individual with a quick wit and silver tongue. He is a master manipulator, able to talk his way out of (or into) almost any situation. Despite his questionable past, he has a certain charm that makes people trust him, even when they should not. This confidence and charisma have served him well in his career as a thief and con artist.

**Interests:** Alexander's interests are largely centered around luxury, wealth, and power. He is drawn to high-stakes risks and is always on the lookout for the next big score. He has a particular fondness for designer suits, rare art, and valuable collectibles. When not planning his next heist, Alexander enjoys indulging in fine dining, expensive cars, and exclusive entertainment.

**Hobbies:** It's unlikely that Alexander would have "hobbies" in the classical sense, as his lifestyle is primarily driven by his work as a thief. However, if forced to choose, he might enjoy activities such as collecting rare artifacts, attending high-society events, or participating in underground poker games.

It's worth noting that these attributes are purely fictional and based on the short story provided. The actual characteristics of Alexander KissStanisław Fuentes, if he were a real person, would be entirely unknown.
