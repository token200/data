Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Alexander Górski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Alexander Górski is likely a tall individual, possibly around 6'1" or 6'2", judging from his ability to notice subtle inconsistencies in people's body language. His eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on the context, it can be inferred that he has piercing eyes, possibly blue or green, which aid him in reading people's reactions and detecting deception.

**Personality:**
Górski's personality is characterized as unorthodox, with a knack for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. He appears to be highly observant, able to pick up on subtle signs of deception, which suggests that he has excellent attention to detail and a keen sense of intuition. His colleagues describe him as having a "sixth sense" for sniffing out leads, indicating that he is extremely perceptive and has a unique way of approaching investigations.

**Interests:**
Górski's interests are centered around puzzles, riddles, and solving complex cases. As a child, he was fascinated by these types of problems, which ultimately led him to become a detective. His passion for investigation and problem-solving is evident in his approach to the art gallery case, where he carefully examined every detail and utilized his intuition to uncover the truth.

It's worth noting that Górski's interests extend beyond his work as a detective. He seems to have a broad range of passions and intellectual pursuits, which are hinted at by the mention of him sitting in his office, "pouring over the details of the case." This suggests that he is an introspective person who enjoys analyzing complex information and solving puzzles outside of his work as well.
