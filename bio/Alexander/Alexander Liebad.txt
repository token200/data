**Personality:**
Alexander Liebad is an enigmatic figure with a quiet confidence that commands attention. He has a strong sense of determination and is driven by an unwavering commitment to solving the most complex mysteries. His reclusive lifestyle can make him appear aloof or detached, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a sharp intellect, exceptional observational skills, and an innate ability to connect seemingly unrelated threads.

Despite his reserved nature, Liebad possesses a fierce passion for uncovering the truth, often leading him down paths fraught with danger and uncertainty. He is fiercely loyal to those he considers close, particularly family members, and will stop at nothing to protect them.

**Interests:**
As an exceptional detective, Alexander Liebad has an unrelenting curiosity about human nature, behavior, and psychology. He is drawn to the intricate workings of the human mind, meticulously analyzing every detail, no matter how seemingly insignificant, in order to unravel the tangled threads of a mystery.

In addition to his work as a detective, Liebad has a secret passion for art, specifically mosaic design. This creative outlet allows him to express himself in ways that are not accessible through his investigative work. His artistic skills are intuitive and highly developed, reflecting a keen understanding of spatial relationships and patterns.

Liebad is also an aficionado of classical literature and historical texts, often finding inspiration in the works of 19th-century European authors. He has a deep respect for the art and culture of Vienna's Austro-Hungarian Empire, which played a significant role in shaping his early years as a detective.

His singular focus on unraveling Sophia's disappearance, however, seems to be driven more by personal conviction than artistic or intellectual curiosity. This singular goal defines Liebad's legacy, imbuing every aspect of his life with an unyielding dedication to uncovering the truth.
