Based on this short story, it can be inferred that Sylwia has a deep connection to her past, having grown up under mysterious circumstances. Her investigation into Ryota's murder seems to have awakened a long-dormant sense of curiosity and determination within her.

It is also implied that Sylwia may have a personal connection to the watch, as it holds sentimental value and possibly ties her to Ryota's sister, who died under mysterious circumstances when Sylwia was just a teenager. This could hint at a deeper backstory or motivation for Sylwia, which is left to be explored further.
