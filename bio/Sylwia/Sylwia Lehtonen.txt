However, she is also open to new experiences and connections, such as meeting Kalle and learning about his life in the small town. Her initial wariness gives way to trust and enthusiasm as she listens to Kalle's stories and feels a sense of belonging.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Sylwia is likely of average height, perhaps around 5'6" (168 cm), given her ability to navigate the frozen forest with ease.

**Interests:** Sylwia is deeply interested in connecting humans with nature and finding solace in the natural world. She is drawn to Kalle's stories of hiking trips, fishing excursions, and summer solstice celebrations, which paint vivid pictures of a life untouched by technology. Her solo hike through the frozen forest also suggests that she values solitude and quiet reflection.
