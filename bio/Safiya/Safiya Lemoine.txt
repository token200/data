Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Safiya Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Safiya is depicted as a determined and courageous individual who has overcome challenges to achieve her goals. She is driven by a strong sense of curiosity and passion for science, particularly genetics. Her upbringing in a wealthy family in Paris may have instilled in her a somewhat privileged background, but it did not seem to hinder her ability to connect with her roots or stand up for what she believes in.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original text does not provide information on Safiya's physical appearance. However, considering her mixed heritage and possibly international upbringing, I would hypothesize that Safiya Lemoine has a unique blend of African and European features. Her hair could be dark brown or black with subtle highlights, reflecting her African roots. Her eye color might be hazel or green, reminiscent of the Mediterranean region where she grew up.

**Height:** Given her ancestry and possibly international upbringing, I would estimate Safiya's height to be around 5'7" (170 cm), which is slightly above average height for European women but closer to average height for African women.

**Interests:** Safiya's interests are primarily focused on genetics, science, and discovery. She has a deep love for gene editing technology and spends countless hours studying her father's research notes and attending lectures at the University of Paris. Her biological connection to an African dynasty also sparked a renewed interest in exploring her ancestral roots, which she finds strength and resilience in.

In addition to these interests, Safiya seems to be deeply driven by a sense of purpose and duty, as evident in her dedication to harnessing gene editing technology for the betterment of humanity.
