Here's a summary of Safiya Välja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Safiya is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, she appears to be a confident and calculating thief, known only by her codename "The Fox". However, beneath this façade lies a deeply introspective and emotionally scarred individual. Her early life of poverty and survival has left emotional scars, making it difficult for her to form close relationships or trust others easily. Despite this, she is fiercely loyal to her team and will do whatever it takes to protect them. As she navigates the moral implications of her actions, Safiya begins to reveal a more vulnerable and empathetic side.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green, often accentuated by her striking eyeliner and makeup
* Hair Color: Dark brown, usually styled in a short, edgy pixie cut
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of parkour and martial arts training

**Interests:** Safiya's interests are centered around her work as a thief and her desire for redemption. She is fascinated by the art of heist planning and execution, often studying the techniques of her predecessors and seeking to improve her own skills. She also has a keen interest in history, particularly the tumultuous past of Estonia, which drives her curiosity about the Crown Jewels. In addition, Safiya enjoys collecting rare and valuable items, not for personal gain, but as a way to fund her charitable endeavors.

**Additional Quirks:**

* Safiya has a habit of whispering cryptic messages to herself before each job, a superstition she believes helps calm her nerves.
* She is an avid reader of literature and philosophy, often devouring books on ethics and morality in the hopes of finding guidance for her own moral compass.

Despite her tough exterior, Safiya Välja is a deeply nuanced and intriguing character, driven by both a desire for justice and a need to forge her own path.
