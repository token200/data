Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dasha Green:

**Personality:** Dasha appears to be a strong-willed and determined individual who is deeply committed to her work as a firefighter. She seems to have a sense of justice, particularly when it comes to rescuing those in need, regardless of their social status. Her willingness to take on the "dirty job" of saving luxury building occupants suggests that she is driven by a strong moral compass and a desire to make a positive impact.

**Physical Attributes:** While the story doesn't provide an abundance of details about Dasha's physical appearance, it can be inferred that she:

* Has long, dark hair that becomes "a frenzy" in the wind.
* Is physically fit and capable enough to tackle challenging situations as a firefighter.
* May have a rugged or athletic build, given her ability to navigate the rooftop and treacherous flames.

Unfortunately, there is no mention of Dasha's height, eye color, or other physical characteristics.

**Interests:** While the story doesn't delve deeply into Dasha's personal interests, it can be inferred that:

* She is passionate about firefighting and rescuing people in need.
* She may have a strong sense of justice and be interested in investigative journalism (given her recognition of Emma Wilson as a journalist).
* She values connection and understanding between people from different walks of life.

It's also possible that Dasha has other interests outside of her work, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the short story.
