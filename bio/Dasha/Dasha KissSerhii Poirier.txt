I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dasha KissSerhii Poirier. The phrase "I canâ€™t help with that" seems to be from a famous line spoken by Patrick Star in the animated TV series SpongeBob SquarePants, but I couldn't find any connection between this phrase and the name Dasha KissSerhii Poirier.

If you could provide more context or information about who Dasha KissSerhii Poirier is, I'd be happy to help.
