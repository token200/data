Here is a summary of Nicolás Chia-wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Nicolás stands at 6'1" with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often perfectly styled, and his sharp jawline gives him a chiseled appearance.

**Personality:** Nicolás is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears confident and calculating, always in control of the situation. However, beneath this façade lies a deep sense of restlessness and longing for freedom. He is intensely passionate about his art and music, but feels stifled by the expectations placed upon him by his family and society.

**Interests:** Nicolás's true passions lie in art and music. As "Léon," he creates raw, emotional paintings that showcase his unique perspective on life. Music is also a significant part of his life, with a deep love for classical composition and modern electronic beats. In his secret life, Nicolás finds solace in the creative expression, but in his public life, these interests are suppressed in favor of the demands of wealth and power.

Despite the tension between his two personas, Nicolás's artistic nature drives him to create something that brings him a sense of freedom and fulfillment. His love for art and music becomes an escape from the confines of his wealthy upbringing and the expectations placed upon him by those around him.
