**Personality:**
Nicolás Molnár is a complex individual with multiple layers to his personality. On the surface, he appears refined, intelligent, and polished, reflecting his success as an expert on Eastern European history. However, beneath this façade lies a man driven by secrets, desires, and a past he's tried to keep locked away. He's guarded and mysterious, yet has a quick wit and sharp mind that allows him to navigate intricate situations with ease.

**Interests:**
Nicolás is deeply passionate about his work as an historian and scholar of Eastern European history. He finds solace in the study of his homeland's complex past, particularly during his time under communism.
