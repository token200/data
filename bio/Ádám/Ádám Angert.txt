**Interests:** Music is Ádám's primary passion, and he has spent countless hours honing his craft as a singer-songwriter. He is particularly drawn to indie rock and folk music, often incorporating elements of these genres into his own work. When not playing guitar or writing songs, Ádám enjoys reading (particularly literature and poetry), practicing yoga, and exploring the city's hidden corners in search of inspiration.

Ádám's love for music is deeply rooted in his experiences with "Echo Fade", a band he co-founded with friends who shared similar passions.
