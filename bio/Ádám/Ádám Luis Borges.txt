He stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with piercing emerald green eyes that seem to sparkle with creativity. His dark hair is often unkempt, and he sports a scruffy beard that adds to his rugged, intellectual demeanor.

Ádám's passion for poetry is matched only by his love of mythology and philosophy. He has a deep understanding of the human condition, which is reflected in his poetry, where he explores the complexities and contradictions of life with nuance and depth. Despite his adventurous spirit, Ádám remains humble and true to his art, always seeking to push the boundaries of language and creativity.

Ádám's discovery of the mysterious bookshop in Buenos Aires was a turning point in his life, opening up new avenues for exploration and creative expression. The experience sparked a sense of wonder and awe within him, inspiring him to continue pushing the boundaries of language and art in all that he does.
