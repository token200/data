- Eye Color: His eyes are a deep brown, almost like dark chocolate, which may reflect his intense emotions and inner struggles.
- Hair: Ádám's hair could be dark brown or black, framing his face with a slight messiness that adds to his brooding appearance.

**Interests:** Ádám seems to appreciate simple things in life, such as the taste of freshly brewed coffee (as seen in the café scene) and the anonymity provided by city streets. He's also fond of watching people and their stories, often getting lost in the rhythm of the city. His past interests include music or arts, but this isn't explicitly stated in the story; however, his melancholy nature suggests he might have been drawn to more somber art forms.

Ádám's hobbies may revolve around observing human behavior, writing (as hinted at by his introspective musings), and possibly photography. He could be someone who keeps a journal or sketchbook to record his thoughts and emotions, which serves as a way for him to process the world around him.

Given Ádám's emotional depth and responsibility towards Léa, it is likely that he prioritizes his role as a guardian and caretaker over other interests.
