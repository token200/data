His works are his way of expressing himself and pushing boundaries, whether it's through painting or possibly ghostwriting for dissident writers. He seems to be drawn to the world of rebellion and subversion, often using his talents as a means of social commentary. When not creating art, Ádám is likely to be found in his cramped, smoke-filled studio, lost in thought and contemplation, fueled by cigarette smoke and the scent of stale beer.
