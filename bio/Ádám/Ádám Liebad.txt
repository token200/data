Here's a summary of the fictional character Ádám Liebad:

**Physical Attributes:** Ádám Liebad stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender yet worn frame, hinting at the years of physical and emotional exhaustion he has endured. His eyes are an intense shade of dark brown that seem to hold a deep sadness and longing. Graying hair, often unkempt and mussed, frames his pale face, adding to the overall air of melancholy.

**Personality:** Ádám is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery. As a former jazz musician, he possesses a natural charisma that can command attention on stage, but offstage, he appears lost and uncertain. His memories haunt him, making it difficult for him to form connections with others or find solace in his own presence. Despite this, there is an undercurrent of hope within him, a spark that refuses to be extinguished.

**Interests:** Ádám's true passion lies in music – specifically jazz. The thrill of creation, the rush of adrenaline during performances, and the sense of community among fellow musicians are what drew him to the stage all those years ago. Even now, as he wanders through Prague's streets, the city's music scene still holds a special allure for him.

**Background:** As mentioned in the original story, Ádám Liebad was once a Hungarian jazz musician who reached the pinnacle of success in Budapest. However, the pressures and expectations of his craft took their toll, leading to a creative stagnation and eventual departure from the world. He now finds himself a stranger in Prague, searching for refuge from the ghosts of his past.

**Psychological State:** Ádám struggles with feelings of disconnection, nostalgia, and melancholy, making it challenging for him to find purpose or meaning in life beyond music. However, as evidenced by his performance at "Píseň" – Song – he is capable of experiencing moments of transcendent joy, hope, and redemption, hinting that there may still be more to him than the sum of his troubled past.
