Based on the short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ádám Popov:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ádám is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, which suggests he's physically fit from years of investigation work. His eye color is blue, a trait that's not mentioned in the story but could be inferred based on his background as a private investigator.

**Personality:**
Ádám appears to be a determined and resourceful individual, accustomed to navigating dark corners of life. He's fiercely independent and driven by a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to take on cases that others can't or won't touch. His confidence in his abilities is evident when he says "This case was going to be a challenge," but he's undaunted by the prospect of solving it.

**Interests:**
As a private investigator, Ádám likely has a keen interest in law enforcement procedures, forensic science, and surveillance techniques. He's probably also familiar with human psychology and behavior, which helps him piece together clues and understand the motivations of those involved in the case. Additionally, his experience working with Ivan Petrov suggests that he may have some background knowledge of high-stakes business dealings and wealthy individuals.

It's worth noting that Ádám's interests might extend beyond his professional life as well. The fact that he's willing to take on a challenging case like Sophia's disappearance suggests that he values fairness, justice, and potentially has a strong sense of empathy for those affected by these crimes.
