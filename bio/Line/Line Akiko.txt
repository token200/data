She seems to have struggled with exhaustion and stress during her time away from Japan, which suggests that she may be someone who feels things deeply. However, after returning home, she is able to let go of her emotions and feel a sense of peace settle over her. Her easygoing nature is also evident in the way she interacts with her sister Yumi, laughing and chatting with her as if they've been reunited for years.

She may be someone who finds comfort in simple pleasures like cooking a proper meal or spending time at home.
