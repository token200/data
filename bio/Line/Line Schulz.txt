**Personality:** Line Schulz appears to be a creative, passionate, and determined individual. She struggles with self-doubt and uncertainty about her art, but once she finds success and guidance, she becomes confident and driven. Her ability to adapt and learn from others (as seen in her relationship with Elara) suggests that she is open-minded and willing to take risks.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Line Schulz is likely around 5'6" to 5'8", as this range seems to be a good fit for the artist's portrayal in the story.

**Interests:** As an artist, Line Schulz is deeply interested in painting, drawing, and capturing the beauty of nature. She also values historical and cultural context, as seen in her desire to learn about techniques and styles from Elara.
