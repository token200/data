**Interests:** As an actress, Line's passion for her craft is evident. She finds solace in the spotlight, but also feels a sense of emptiness despite her success. Her interests may include:

* Acting and performing
* Writing ( possibly as a way to process her emotions)
* Traveling and exploring new places (perhaps to escape the pressures of fame)
* Connecting with others on a deeper level (thanks to Sofia's visit, she begins to see hope in forming meaningful relationships)

It's worth noting that Line's interests may be influenced by her Italian upbringing and her desire for connection and belonging. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she navigates the pressures of fame while searching for meaning beyond her public persona.
