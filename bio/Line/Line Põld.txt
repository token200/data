Based on the new story I created for Line PÃµld, here's a summary of her personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Line is a compassionate, wise, and gentle soul with a deep connection to nature. She possesses an air of mystique and authority that inspires trust and respect in those around her. Her calm demeanor and soothing presence make her an excellent listener and counselor. Line is also fiercely protective of those she cares about, but she approaches this protection with a sense of quiet confidence rather than aggression.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Line stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, often described as "the darkest blue" by those who have had the privilege of meeting her.
* Hair: Line's hair is long and wavy, with subtle hints of silver threading through it. The color is reminiscent of a moonlit night, shifting from dark brown to platinum in shades that seem to adapt to the light.
* Skin: Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, as if kissed by the Estonian sun. It's smooth and unblemished, reflecting her gentle lifestyle.

**Interests:** Line's interests revolve around natural remedies, herbalism, and the mystical connections between humans, animals, and the environment. She is deeply knowledgeable about plants, their properties, and how to harness them for healing purposes. Her love of nature extends beyond her garden; she is often found exploring the surrounding forests, meadows, and coastlines in search of rare flowers, herbs, or hidden patterns.

In terms of specific interests outside of herbalism, Line enjoys:

* Reading ancient texts on magic, mythology, and folklore
* Listening to stories from the local community about their traditions, legends, and historical events
* Meditating under the stars to connect with the celestial rhythms
