Here's a summary of Salvatore "Sam" Webb's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sam is a complex individual with a mysterious past. He has a rugged good looks and quick wit that has won over many hearts, but beneath this facade lies a web of emotions fueled by pain and loss. Despite his tough exterior, he is vulnerable and guarded, having been hurt in the past. As he opens up to Mimi, he reveals a dry, Cajun soul that is slowly mending. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about, as demonstrated by his willingness to confront his demons head-on.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue-green eyes with a hint of hazelnut undertones
* Hair Color: Dark brown hair that's often unkempt and messy
* Skin Tone: Warm, bronzed complexion from spending time outdoors

**Interests:** Sam has an affinity for the outdoors, particularly the wilderness of Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge. He enjoys exploring the bayous, hunting, and fishing in his free time. Despite his love for solitude, he has a soft spot for animals, often taking on odd jobs to help care for those in need. When with Mimi, he's drawn to laughter, warmth, and conversation, showing a more vulnerable side to his personality.

It's worth noting that Sam's past experiences have left him with emotional scars, making it difficult for him to form lasting connections or trust others. However, with Mimi by his side, he begins to heal and find a sense of belonging and purpose in life.
