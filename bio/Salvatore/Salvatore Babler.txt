As he opens up to Sophia, it becomes clear that he has a rich inner life, filled with secrets and lies from his past.

**Physical Attributes:** Sam stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, framing his angular face with messy waves. His eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to hold a depth that's difficult to read. He has a small nose ring and a scattering of tattoos on his wrists, hinting at his artistic side.
