**Personality:** Salvatore is a quiet and methodical individual who speaks with few words. However, his actions reveal a deep sense of kindness and dedication to helping others. He is patient and willing to take the time to explain complex problems to those who don't understand them. This rare display of emotion suggests that he may be more sensitive than he initially appears.

**Physical Attributes:** Salvatore is 35 years old. His physical attributes are not described in detail, but it can be inferred that he has a sturdy build, likely developed from his years as a soldier and mechanic. He probably maintains himself well, given the dedication he shows to his work at Petrov's Garage.

Unfortunately, there is no mention of Salvatore's eye color, so I'll leave that attribute blank for now. It would be interesting to imagine him with piercing blue eyes or warm brown eyes, both of which could complement his rugged yet gentle demeanor.

**Interests:** Salvatore is passionate about fixing cars and machines, likely inherited from his father who taught him everything he knows. He finds joy in the process of tinkering and problem-solving, which suggests that he is a hands-on learner who values practical experience over theoretical knowledge.
