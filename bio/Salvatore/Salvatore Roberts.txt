Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Salvatore "Sam" Roberts' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sam is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He possesses a dry wit and a sense of humor, often shown through his nickname "The Ghost," which he earned for his cunning and resourcefulness in surviving the streets of New York City as a young boy. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep emotional core, driven by loyalty and a desire for justice. He is fiercely protective of those he cares about and will go to great lengths to help others escape the same circumstances that defined his own life.

**Physical Attributes:** Sam stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in physically demanding activities. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a depth of emotion and experience that is unsettling to those who meet him for the first time. His rugged features are accentuated by a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he acquired during one of his many confrontations.

**Interests:** Sam's interests revolve around helping others escape the cycle of poverty and violence that defined his youth. He finds solace in working with community centers, job training programs, and social services organizations that aim to provide opportunities for those in need. Music plays a significant role in his life as well; he has a deep affection for Sinatra's music and often seeks out old records or CDs when looking for comfort. Whiskey is another favorite of his, but it is one he consumes responsibly, using it to soothe himself after a long day.

Sam's love for justice and redemption drives him forward, and he continues to search for answers in the face of adversity, always seeking ways to make amends for past hurts and help others find their own paths towards healing.
