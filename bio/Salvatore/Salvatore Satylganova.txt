Beneath his polished exterior lies a deeply emotional and introspective person, driven by a passion for uncovering hidden secrets and stories in the art world.

When not immersed in the world of art, Salvatore enjoys long walks in the city's oldest neighborhoods, browsing antique shops and dusty archives for hidden treasures and obscure artifacts. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and literary theory to deepen his understanding of the human condition and the creative process.

Despite his many interests and passions, Salvatore remains a humble and introspective individual, preferring to let his discoveries speak for themselves rather than seeking to draw attention to himself.
