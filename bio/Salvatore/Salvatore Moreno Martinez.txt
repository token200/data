Here's a summary of Salvatore "Sam" Moreno Martinez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sam stands at 6'1" with an imposing build, honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in physically demanding activities. His eyes are an unsettling shade of piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. His sharp jawline is accentuated by a subtle scruff of stubble, giving him a rugged yet refined appearance.

**Personality:** Sam's past has left emotional scars, but he remains fiercely independent and resilient. He has an unyielding sense of self-preservation and will stop at nothing to protect himself or those he cares about. Despite this, there is a depth to his eyes that suggests he may still harbor emotions, such as loyalty, compassion, or even love. Sam's demeanor can be calm and collected, but beneath the surface lies a cauldron of raw instincts and primal fears.

**Interests:** When not running his bakery, Sam enjoys indulging in whiskey, cigars, and the simple pleasures of life. He is an avid observer of human nature, often studying people from afar to understand their motivations and behaviors. Sam has a fascination with history, particularly the darker aspects of it, which seems to fuel his curiosity about the world around him.

In his free time, he likes to take long walks along the Buenos Aires streets, immersing himself in the city's rhythms and sounds. This allows him to keep an ear to the ground for rumors or whispers about potential threats, keeping his legendary status as a retired hitman at bay. Sam also enjoys listening to classical music, which provides a welcome respite from the chaos of his past.

Despite his efforts to blend into the crowd, there is a sense that Sam's past will always be tied to him, and he must constantly navigate this delicate balance between his old life and his new one.
