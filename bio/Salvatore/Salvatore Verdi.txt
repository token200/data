**Physical Attributes:** Salvatore Verdi stands at around 6'1" with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his chiseled features and angular jawline. His eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to hold a world of emotion within them. He has a strong nose and full lips that curve into a subtle smile when he's lost in thought.

**Personality:** Salvatore is a quiet and introspective person with an air of confidence that commands respect from those who meet him. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or enigmatic to those who don't know him, but once you get to know him, he reveals himself to be kind, empathetic, and deeply passionate about his art. He is a listener, always attuned to the subtleties of human emotion and the rhythms of the universe.

**Interests:** Salvatore is an accomplished artist and musician with a deep love for all forms of creative expression. He spends most of his free time honing his craft, whether it's painting, playing the piano, or experimenting with new sounds on his guitar. Music has a profound effect on him, and he finds solace in the quiet moments when he can lose himself in the rhythms and melodies. His apartment is a reflection of his artistic soul, filled with half-finished canvases, musical instruments, and scattered notes and lyrics.

**Additional Quirks:** Salvatore has a habit of carrying a small notebook and pencil with him at all times, jotting down observations, ideas, or phrases that strike him as inspiration. He is also a bit of a nocturnal creature, finding his most creative energy in the late hours of the night when the world outside seems to slow down. Despite his introspective nature, he has a deep sense of curiosity and love for exploration, often venturing into the city's hidden corners to seek out new sounds, stories, or artistic inspirations.
