Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Salvatore Rivera's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Salvatore "Sam" Rivera is described as one of the toughest and most principled guys on the street. He has a reputation for being a man with a name that commands respect in the city's underworld. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side and a determination to make a difference outside of his previous work as a police detective. Sam is also shown to be empathetic, understanding, and willing to take on cases that need discreet attention.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (a tall and imposing figure)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or almost black (not piercing green, which was mentioned in the story as belonging to Sofia)

Unfortunately, there is no information about Sam's physical appearance beyond his height. He is likely a ruggedly handsome man with a strong build, given his profession as a private investigator.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Sam's interests revolve around solving mysteries and helping those in need. His work at Rivera Investigations suggests that he takes on cases that involve insurance claims, missing persons, or other crimes that require discretion. He also seems to have an interest in the darker aspects of human nature, as evident from his investigation into Emily's case involving a mysterious benefactor.

Other interests are not explicitly mentioned in the story, but it can be inferred that Sam values justice and is driven by a desire to help people in need, particularly those who have been vulnerable or exploited.
