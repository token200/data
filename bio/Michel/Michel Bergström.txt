Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Michel Bergström:

**Personality:** Michel Bergström is a master manipulator with a complex web of motivations and desires. He appears calm and detached on the surface but is driven by a desire to push boundaries and achieve his goals through any means necessary. Despite this, he has a charisma that draws people in, making it difficult for others to fully understand what drives them to befriend him.

**Physical Attributes:** Michel Bergström stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an unassuming presence. He has short, dark brown hair and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he encounters. His features are neutral, allowing him to blend into any environment and adopt different personas as needed.

**Interests:** Michel Bergström is fascinated by the world of art, particularly contemporary art, which is why he was drawn to Emily Wilson's work. He is a patron and mentor to many artists, using his guidance and support to further their careers in exchange for access to their creative output. Beyond his interest in art, Michel is also driven by a desire for power and control, often manipulating those around him to achieve his goals.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide much information about Michel's interests outside of art and his desire for power, so these are speculative additions based on his behavior towards Emily Wilson.
