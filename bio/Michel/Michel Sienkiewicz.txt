Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Michel Sienkiewicz:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Jet-black
* Hair Style: Swooping arc of hair that falls across his forehead
* Glasses: Thick black glasses perched on the end of his nose

**Personality:**
Michel is a brilliant, enigmatic, and somewhat introverted artist who is deeply passionate about his craft. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to keep people at arm's length, which can make it challenging for others to get close to him. Despite this, he has a deep desire to connect with others on an intellectual level, particularly when it comes to art and creativity.

**Interests:**

* Art: Michel is deeply interested in exploring the boundaries of art and pushing the limits of what is possible.
* Symbolism: He is fascinated by the use of symbols and codes in art, and sees them as a way to tap into deeper meanings and themes.
* Music: Michel enjoys listening to classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which he finds evocative of his own emotional state.
* Literature: He is an avid reader of philosophical texts and literary classics, which often inspire his artistic vision.

**Habits:**

* Michel has a tendency to be overly critical of himself and others when it comes to art.
* He is a perfectionist who can become consumed by the desire to create something truly exceptional.
* Despite his introverted nature, he has a strong sense of justice and will speak out on issues that he feels are important.

**Quirks:**

* Michel often talks to himself in French when he's nervous or deep in thought.
* He has a habit of muttering artistic musings under his breath while working on a canvas.
* Despite his refined appearance, he has a tendency to get paint stains on his clothes and shirts.
