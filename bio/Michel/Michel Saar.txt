I'd like to start with a blank slate and create a character based on the prompts you provided. Here's a summary of Michel Saar:

**Personality:** Michel Saar is a complex and introspective individual. As a detective, he has developed a strong sense of justice and a keen analytical mind. However, his past experiences have also left emotional scars, making him guarded and slightly introverted. Despite this, he has a deep empathy for those who are marginalized or oppressed, which drives his pursuit of truth and justice.

**Physical Attributes:** Michel Saar is 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his years of physical activity. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, framing his sharp features and piercing blue eyes. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly harrowing case early in his career.

**Interests:** Michel Saar's interests are diverse and reflect his dual nature as both an artist and a detective. When not solving crimes, he enjoys painting and sketching, finding solace in the creative process. He is also an avid reader of philosophy, psychology, and history, which helps him understand the motivations behind human behavior.

As for his artistic side, Michel Saar's style is a unique blend of realism and surrealism. His paintings often capture the darker aspects of society, but with a hint of hope and redemption. This dichotomy reflects his own inner struggles and his desire to find balance in a chaotic world.

I'd like to start developing this character further based on your prompts or discuss how I can help refine the story idea that resonates with you the most.
