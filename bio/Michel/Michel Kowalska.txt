Here is a summary of Michel Kowalska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Michel Kowalska is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or guarded to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior, he has a deep sense of loyalty and commitment to the people and causes he cares about. As a former spy, Michel has had to develop strong instincts and strategic thinking skills, which serve him well in both personal and professional relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Michel Kowalska is a tall man in his late 40s, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). His eyes are a deep brown that seem to bore into those he looks at. His dark hair is flecked with grey, giving him a distinguished and weathered appearance. He has a lean, athletic build from his years of espionage work.

**Interests:** As a retired spy, Michel Kowalska's interests have shifted away from high-stakes international intrigue. He now enjoys simpler pursuits like reading (particularly historical non-fiction), practicing yoga to manage stress, and tending to his garden. He is also an avid collector of antique books and artwork, which he finds soothing and thought-provoking.

Despite his quieter lifestyle, Michel's espionage background has left him with a strong sense of justice and a desire to use his skills for good. When Sophia drops the bombshell about Project Eclipse, it awakens something within him, and he begins to re-evaluate his life and the secrets he has kept hidden for so long.
