Here's a summary of Michel Christensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Michel is a tall and lean man in his mid-40s. He stands at around 6'2" with a wiry build, honed from years of surviving on the streets. His eyes are an unsettling shade of blue, almost grey, which seem to hold a deep intensity. His dark hair is often unkempt, and he has a scattering of scars on his face and hands that speak to his rough past.

**Personality:** Michel is a complex and introspective individual. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which served him well growing up on the streets. However, this same drive can also make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep love for horology and a passion that borders on obsession. This intensity can make him appear "lost in time," always focused on the next project or puzzle to solve.

**Interests:** Michel's true calling is horology - the study and craftsmanship of timekeeping. He's an expert watchmaker, able to craft intricate mechanisms with ease and precision. His work is a reflection of his love for order and structure, and he finds joy in understanding the delicate balance of gears and springs. However, as revealed in the story, his obsession with horology also stems from a deeper desire for connection and belonging. With the return of his sister Astrid, Michel's priorities shift towards family and relationships, but his passion for timekeeping remains an integral part of who he is.

Overall, Michel Christensen is a man of contrasts - tough on the outside, vulnerable on the inside; driven by his passion, yet open to the possibility of love and connection.
