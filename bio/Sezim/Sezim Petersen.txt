Sezim appears to be a perfectionist, pouring over his work and experimenting tirelessly to unlock new secrets. He has an uncanny ability to tap into the mysterious forces that govern his creations, which sometimes borders on obsession. This dedication comes with a risk of being perceived as cursed or even possessed by some, but Sezim seems entirely comfortable with this ambiguity.
