Based on the inspiration from the short story about Sezil Sienkiewicz, I've created a new character profile for you:

- Facial Features: Sezil has prominent cheekbones, a pointed chin, and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His nose is slightly aquiline, giving him an air of intellectual intensity.

Personality:
Sezil is an eccentric inventor with an insatiable curiosity for the world around him. He's a perfectionist who sees flaws everywhere, but his passion for discovery often clouds his judgment. Despite his tendency to be reclusive and aloof, Sezil has a soft spot for those in need, particularly children and animals. His sharp wit and quick intellect make him a formidable opponent in debates and arguments.
