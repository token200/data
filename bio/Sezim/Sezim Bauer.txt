However, he is fiercely loyal to those he trusts, particularly Rachel, who has been instrumental in helping him understand and control his powers.

**Physical Attributes:** Sezim stands at 6'1" with an athletic build, which hints at a more active lifestyle than he may let on. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a world of secrets within them. He often dresses in layers, favoring darker colors and jeans, giving off a somewhat introverted appearance.

**Interests:** Sezim's interests revolve around understanding and exploring the mysteries of parallel universes and his unique gift. He is fascinated by the concept of alternate realities and spends countless hours studying and experimenting with his powers. On more mundane days, he enjoys grabbing coffee at the local caf√© (as seen in the story) or reading science fiction novels to pass the time.

Sezim's fascination with parallel universes has also led him to develop a strong interest in philosophy and cosmology, often finding himself pondering the implications of his abilities on the nature of reality itself.
