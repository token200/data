Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Sezim Jansone's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sezim appears to be an enigmatic figure with a mysterious aura surrounding her. Her air of mystery might suggest that she is introverted or prefers to keep people at arm's length. However, despite the warnings and warnings from others, she seems to be driven by her passion for art and willing to take risks to create something truly meaningful.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Sezim's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but given her air of mystery and artistic persona, I would estimate her to be around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are described as "two pools of liquid darkness," which suggests that they might be an unusual shade of color. Based on this description, I would imagine her eyes to be a deep, almost black brown or even an inky blue-gray color.

**Interests:** Sezim's primary interest is her art, specifically surreal painting. She seems to have a unique ability to capture the essence of human experience through her work, which earns her international recognition and accolades. Despite the risks and challenges associated with her talent, she continues to create art that pushes boundaries and explores new themes.

It's worth noting that Sezim's personality and interests may be influenced by the vengeful spirit that curses her, and her experiences with this entity have shaped her into the person she is today. However, her drive for creativity and self-expression remains a constant thread throughout the story.
