**Personality:** Francesco is a complex and troubled individual with a sharp wit and quick tongue. He has built a reputation as one of the shrewdest players on Wall Street, but beneath his charming facade lies a deep-seated need for control and fear of vulnerability. He has been haunted by pain and regret in his personal life, particularly due to his absent father and loss of his mother at a young age.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Build: Lean and athletic, likely honed from years of working out to maintain his high level of physical fitness
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, piercing eyebrows, and a sharp nose that suggests a determined and focused individual

**Interests:** As a successful businessman, Francesco is intensely interested in finance, economics, and the world of high-stakes deal-making. He is also drawn to books, particularly those on philosophy, psychology, and self-help. However, his sister Sophia's visit has awakened a desire within him to explore other aspects of life, including art, travel, and taking risks.

It is likely that Francesco's interests have been influenced by his upbringing, with his absent father possibly instilling in him a love for books and intellectual pursuits. His mother's loss may have also shaped his appreciation for the beauty and simplicity of life, as hinted at by Sophia's words about finding joy in the mundane.
