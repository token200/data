**Physical Attributes:** Francesco is approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His eyes are a bright brown color that sparkle with creativity, reflecting his passion for art. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges charm. Francisco has a scattering of scars on his hands and arms from years of working with discarded materials, but they only add to his rugged appeal.
