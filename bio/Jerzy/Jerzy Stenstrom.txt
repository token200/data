Here is a summary of Jerzy Stenstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jerzy Stenstrom is a man of mystery with an air of quiet confidence. He is a master of surveillance and has honed his skills over decades as a former operative of the Polish intelligence agency, Wisnia. Despite his peaceful appearance, Jerzy's past still lingers, etched into every wrinkle on his weathered face. He is fiercely protective of those he trusts and can sense deception with ease. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a deep empathy for those who are seeking the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a hint of grey at the outer edges
* Hair: Silver, thinning, and combed back to reveal his weathered face
* Build: Lean, athletic, and wiry, with a subtle weight loss that suggests years of disciplined living
* Facial Features: Weathered, worn, and etched with deep lines and creases, giving him an air of wisdom and experience

**Interests:** Jerzy Stenstrom is an avid gardener, tending to his small garden on the rural estate outside Warsaw. He finds solace in the quiet, methodical work of nurturing plants and watching them grow. His other interests include reading, particularly history and espionage literature, as well as listening to classical music and poetry. Jerzy also has a fondness for fine scotch and good conversation.

It's worth noting that Jerzy's past experiences have left him with some emotional scars, making it difficult for him to open up to new people or relationships. However, his encounter with Aleksandra brings out a glimmer of curiosity and perhaps even a desire to reconnect with the world beyond his garden.
