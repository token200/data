Based on the short story, here is a summary of Jerzy Cooper's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jerzy Cooper is a introspective and emotionally guarded individual who has built walls around himself after experiencing trauma and loss. However, as he opens up to Szczepan, he reveals a deep-seated desire for hope, resilience, and human connection. He is also shown to be resilient, determined, and eventually finds a new sense of purpose in helping others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue-Grey (a color that reflects his complex emotions and introspective nature)

**Interests:** After finding solace with Szczepan's company, Jerzy Cooper develops a passion for volunteering at local charities. He becomes driven to help those in need, which gives him a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Other interests that emerge in his life include listening to music (possibly classical or folk music), reading about history, and engaging in conversations about philosophy and the human condition.

It's worth noting that Jerzy's past experiences have left emotional scars, making it difficult for him to open up or share his feelings with others. However, through his interactions with Szczepan, he begins to confront his demons and find new ways to connect with the world around him.
