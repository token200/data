Here is a summary of the fictional character Jerzy Girace:

**Physical Attributes:** Jerzy stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build, suggesting he maintains a regular exercise routine. His eye color is a bright, piercing blue that seems to sparkle with intensity when he's focused on solving a case.

**Personality:** Jerzy is known for his sharp mind and quick wit, which makes him an exceptional detective. He has an unorthodox approach to investigation that allows him to think outside the box and consider unconventional solutions. Despite his tough exterior, Jerzy has a compassionate side and genuinely cares about solving cases that affect his clients' lives.

**Interests:** As a private investigator in Warsaw, Jerzy's interests lie at the intersection of detection, politics, and social justice. He is drawn to cases involving high-society scandals, embezzlement schemes, and other forms of corruption. In his free time, Jerzy enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, visiting museums, and reading literature that explores the human condition.

Jerzy also seems to have an affinity for coffee, as mentioned in the short story where he sips his coffee at a caf√© while gathering information. His love for coffee suggests that he values comfort and tranquility, perhaps serving as a counterbalance to the high-stakes world of detection.
