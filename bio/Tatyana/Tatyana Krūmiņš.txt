Here is a summary of the fictional character Tatyana Krūmiņš:

**Physical Attributes:** Tatyana is likely a petite woman with long, dark hair and piercing blue eyes (a common trait among Latvian people). She stands around 5'2" (157 cm) tall. Her slender build belies her sharp intellect and intense focus on her work.

**Personality:** Tatyana is a brilliant and introverted scientist who is deeply passionate about her research. Despite her reclusive nature, she has a warm and nurturing side, as evident in her mentorship of Maria. She is fiercely dedicated to her work and expects the same level of commitment from those around her. Her dry sense of humor and occasional quotes from mentors suggest that she is not afraid to poke fun at herself or offer words of wisdom to others.

**Interests:** Tatyana's primary interest lies in understanding the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, particularly ocean acidification. She is deeply fascinated by the power and beauty of the ocean, which has inspired her to dedicate her career to studying its dynamics. Her work is a combination of science, curiosity, and passion, driven by a desire to protect the world's waters from human-induced damage.

In her free time (which is limited!), Tatyana might enjoy reading about marine biology, listening to classical music, or taking short walks along the coast to clear her mind. Despite her busy schedule, she finds joy in mentoring young researchers like Maria and watching them grow into confident scientists in their own right.
