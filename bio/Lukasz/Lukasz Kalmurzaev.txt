**Interests:** Music is Lukasz's lifeblood, and he's deeply fascinated by the intersection of traditional Russian folk music, jazz, and worldbeat influences. He's a voracious learner, always seeking out new sounds, styles, and inspiration from around the world. When not composing or performing with his band, Lukasz loves to explore the outdoors, hiking through the forests and mountains of Eastern Europe in search of unique landscapes and mythological stories that can inform his music.

**Additional Traits:** Lukasz has a quirky sense of humor and is often seen laughing at his own jokes or making light-hearted remarks between takes. He's fiercely loyal to his friends and bandmates, always willing to take risks and try new things to support their artistic endeavors.
