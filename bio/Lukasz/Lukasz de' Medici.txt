However, he also seems uncertain and slightly overwhelmed by the darker aspects of mysticism and superstition in Florence's society. As a member of the powerful de' Medici family, Lukasz is likely driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, but his encounter with Lady Isabella's illness leaves him questioning whether his family's power and influence can truly protect them from the forces of darkness.
