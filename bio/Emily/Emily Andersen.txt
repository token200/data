Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Emily Andersen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Emily is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. She stands at around 5'8" with long, curly brown hair that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eye color is a bright, sparkling blue that seems to hold warmth and kindness. Her features are delicate yet strong, reflecting the resilience of the woman she is.

**Personality:** Emily appears to be a compassionate, introspective person who values family, home, and heritage deeply. She has a nostalgic streak and often finds herself lost in memories of her childhood. Despite her return to Willow Creek as an adult, Emily's emotional connection to this place suggests that she may have retained some innocence and wonder from her youth. Her experience with grief and loss (her mother's passing) also indicates that she is resilient, empathetic, and strong-willed.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Emily has a deep love for nature, particularly gardening and botany. The discovery of an old trunk containing letters from her grandmother highlights her interest in family history and genealogy. Her exploration of the Andersen house also reveals a passion for preserving memories and holding onto the past, suggesting that she values tradition and heritage.

It's worth noting that Emily's story doesn't provide many explicit details about her interests beyond these inferences. However, based on the narrative, it seems clear that she has a deep connection to her roots and is eager to reconnect with them.
