On the surface, she presents herself as confident and poised, but beneath this exterior lies a deeply guarded and vulnerable person who struggles to connect with others on an emotional level. She has a tendency to shield herself behind a mask of bravado and sarcasm, which often makes it difficult for people to get close to her.

However, when pushed out of her comfort zone, Monika reveals a more sensitive side, as seen in her encounter at the high-society gala where she opened up about her experiences with heartache and loss. She is capable of empathy and compassion, but only begins to share these qualities when someone creates a safe space for her to do so.

In her free time, Monika enjoys reading literary fiction, practicing yoga, and indulging in fine wine. She is also an avid art collector, with a particular fondness for abstract expressionism.
