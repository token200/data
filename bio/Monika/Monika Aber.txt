She is also passionate about history and has been inspired by her father's love of archaeology. As she engages with her father, Monika demonstrates a strong sense of determination and resilience, willing to confront difficult questions and emotions head-on.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the story about Monika's physical attributes beyond her eye color. However, based on her age (unspecified but likely middle-aged) and background as a history buff, it can be inferred that she may have an average to above-average build. Her height is not mentioned either.

**Eye Color:** Given her interest in history, it would seem plausible for Monika's eyes to be brown or green, colors often associated with earthy tones and historical relics.

In terms of interests outside of academia, there is no direct mention of specific hobbies or activities that Monika enjoys. However, given her driven personality and curiosity-driven nature, it's possible that she may also enjoy solo activities like reading, journaling, or even urban exploration (given her tracking skills).
