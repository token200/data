Here's a summary of Monika Ozols' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Monika is known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, which initially hides a heart of gold. She is fearless and driven, always chasing down leads and uncovering the truth no matter what it takes. As a seasoned journalist, she has developed a thick skin, but deep down, she has a strong sense of empathy and compassion. Her past experiences have also made her resilient and determined.

**Physical Attributes:** Monika stands at around 5'8" with striking blue eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a sharp jawline and high cheekbones. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of investigative work.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Monika's primary interest lies in uncovering the truth and exposing wrongdoing. However, her experience with her sister Elza's descent into crime has made her realize the importance of personal relationships and family ties. She now also finds herself drawn to helping others who are struggling with similar issues, using her skills to make a positive impact on her community.

In her free time, Monika enjoys reading about psychology, sociology, and criminology, which she believes helps her understand human behavior and motivations better. She is an avid fan of jazz music, often listening to classic songs by Miles Davis or Billie Holiday while working on her latest stories. Her love for the art world also stems from her own experiences in the warehouse with Elza's stolen artwork, and she has become fascinated by the intersection of art and crime.
