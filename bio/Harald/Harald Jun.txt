Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Harald Jun:

**Personality:** Harald Jun is portrayed as a mysterious and skilled hunter and tracker with an uncanny ability to navigate the Arctic wilderness. He is described as not being a man to be trifled with, suggesting that he has a strong sense of self-reliance and resilience. His past is shrouded in mystery, adding to his enigmatic persona. However, his determination to survive and thrive in the harsh environment suggests that he is also driven by a sense of duty and possibly a thirst for adventure.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no details provided about Harald Jun's physical appearance beyond one cryptic description of an "enigmatic smile." However, we can make some educated guesses based on his profession as a hunter and tracker. It is likely that he is physically fit and has a strong build, with perhaps rugged features to match the harsh Arctic environment he calls home.

Assuming Harald Jun's height is consistent with a typical Norwegian male, I would estimate him to be around 5'10" (178 cm) tall. His eye color is unknown, but considering his heritage as a Norwegian, it is possible that he has blue or green eyes, which are common in Scandinavian countries.

**Interests:** As a skilled hunter and tracker, Harald Jun's primary interest is likely the wilderness and the thrill of the hunt. He is drawn to the Arctic tundra, where he can test his skills against the harsh environment and its incredible wildlife. His ability to navigate by the stars and track elusive prey suggests that he has a deep respect for nature and a desire to understand its workings.

It's also clear that Harald Jun values resilience and determination, as evidenced by his ability to persevere through storms, blizzards, and other extreme conditions. This suggests that he is drawn to challenges and is willing to push himself to the limit in order to survive and thrive.
