**Personality:** Harald appears to be a passionate and dedicated individual, driven by his love for art. He is described as hunching over his easel, surrounded by half-finished canvases, indicating his intense focus on his craft. His bold brushstrokes and vivid colors suggest that he is confident in his artistic abilities and unafraid to take risks. When interacting with others, Harald seems charismatic, able to engage in easy conversations with people like Poliziano.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, we can infer some of Harald's physical characteristics:

* Height: It's not explicitly stated, but given his father Lorenzo's height (he is described as standing at the edge of the room), it's likely that Harald is slightly shorter.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, there is no mention of Harald's eye color in the story. However, considering his association with the wealthy and influential Medici family, it's possible that he has piercing or bright eyes to match his father's reputation.
