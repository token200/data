He has piercing blue eyes that sparkle with curiosity, and his dark hair is often tousled, giving him a gentle, boyish appearance. His features are not striking, but they carry a quiet intensity that commands attention.

**Interests:** Hal's love for language, literature, and philosophy led him to become an avid reader of poetry, particularly the works of Baudelaire and Rimbaud. He is also drawn to the written word and has a passion for writing, using his antique typewriter to craft letters, stories, and poems that reflect his inner world. His travels have given him a deep appreciation for art, architecture, and the culture of Eastern Europe, which he weaves into his performances as a traveling bard.

As a storyteller, Hal is fascinated by the human condition, love, loss, and the search for belonging. He finds solace in the words of others and seeks to share these stories with others, creating connections that transcend borders and boundaries.
