Here is a summary of Harald Górski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Harald Górski is a complex and introspective person, haunted by the memories of his sister's murder. He has a troubled past as a retired detective, struggling with guilt, grief, and self-doubt. Despite this, he remains fiercely determined and resolute, driven by a desire for justice and closure. Harald's sharp instincts and keen observational skills serve him well in his investigation, but his emotional scars also make it difficult for him to trust others and form close relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Harald Górski is likely a middle-aged man, probably in his late 50s or early 60s. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a rugged, worn appearance, reflecting his years of experience as a detective and the toll it has taken on his physical health. His eyes are a deep brown, possibly flecked with gray, giving him a weathered, world-weary look. His hair is graying, cut short, and unkempt, framing a face lined by time, grief, and hard living.

**Interests:** As a retired detective, Harald's interests revolve around his work and solving the mystery of his sister's murder. He spends countless hours studying cases, re-interviewing witnesses, and researching new leads. Outside of his investigation, Harald enjoys drinking whiskey, reading books, and taking long walks in the city to clear his mind.

In his current state, however, even these comforts seem to bring him little solace. The only thing that seems to give him a sense of purpose is the possibility of finally uncovering the truth about Elżbieta's murder.
