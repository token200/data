Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Harald Corberó's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Harald Corberó appears to be a charismatic and confident individual who is able to stay calm under pressure. He seems to have an air of mystery surrounding him, which allows him to maintain his reputation as a master thief. Despite the attention he receives from the public and law enforcement, he remains impervious to it, suggesting that he has a strong sense of self-preservation and discipline.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair: Dark brown, cut short and stylishly messy

Additional details about Harald Corberó's physical appearance are not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will provide some speculative information:

* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, possibly with a Mediterranean or Latin American heritage.
* Facial Features: Chiseled cheekbones, sharp jawline, and full lips that curve into a subtle smile.

**Interests:** Based on his profession as a master thief, it can be inferred that Harald Corberó has a strong interest in:

* Treasure hunting and collecting rare artifacts
* Mastering various skills such as lock-picking, safe-cracking, and disguise techniques
* Outsmarting law enforcement and staying one step ahead of the competition
* Building and maintaining relationships with other members of the underworld or organized crime networks

It is also possible that Harald Corberó has a fascination with high-stakes games and puzzles, as hinted at by his cryptic message on the windowsill ("Harald Corberó was here"). This could suggest that he enjoys intellectual challenges and pushing himself to solve complex problems.

Of course, these details are speculative based on limited information from the story. A more in-depth exploration of Harald Corberó's character would be needed to flesh out his personality, interests, and motivations further.
