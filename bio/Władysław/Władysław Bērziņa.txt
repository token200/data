**Personality:** Władysław Bērziņa is depicted as a resourceful and clever individual who uses his skills to help those in need.

It's worth noting that Władysław's physical appearance is not extensively described in the short story. To fill this gap, I have added some attributes based on typical characteristics associated with individuals from Latvia.

**Interests:** As a former engineer, Władysław likely has an interest in problem-solving and innovation. His experience as "The Engineer" suggests that he enjoys puzzles and decoding messages, making cryptography or code-breaking one of his interests.

Additionally, given his background in carpentry and his involvement with the underground movement, it's possible that Władysław has a strong affinity for woodworking, DIY projects, or other hands-on activities. His resourcefulness and ingenuity might lead him to be interested in DIY electronics, robotics, or other engineering-related hobbies.
