Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Władysław Ming-che's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Władysław Ming-che appears to be an enigmatic and calculating individual with an aura of calm detachment. He is highly skilled and cunning, able to outsmart even the most secure systems. This suggests that he is intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable. His ability to move with precision, as described in the story, indicates a sense of focus and attention to detail.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the short story. However, for the sake of completion, I will make an educated guess based on his profession:

* Height: Władysław Ming-che appears to be slender, with a height around 5'9" (175 cm) or slightly taller, allowing him to move agilely and navigate through crowded spaces undetected.
* Eye Color: His eye color is unknown, but I imagine it would be an exotic shade such as emerald green or piercing brown, reflecting his Eastern European origins.

**Interests:** As a cat burglar, Władysław Ming-che's primary interest appears to be accumulating rare and valuable treasures. However, based on the story, it can also be inferred that he has a fascination with art, history, and culture, as evidenced by his appreciation for the priceless artifact in Mr. Lee's collection.

It's worth noting that these attributes are speculative, and more about Władysław Ming-che's true personality, interests, and motivations would require further exploration in a longer narrative.
