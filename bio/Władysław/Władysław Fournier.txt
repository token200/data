Here is a summary of Władysław Fournier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Władysław Fournier stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an unassuming presence that belies his artistic past. His hair is thinning, gray around the temples, framing a face that was once handsome but now worn from grief and isolation. His eyes are an intense, piercing blue, often filled with a deep longing for creative expression. He has a gaunt, fragile build, a result of years of poor health and inactivity.

**Personality:** Władysław Fournier is a complex, enigmatic individual whose emotions are layered beneath a stoic exterior. Despite his physical disability, he possesses an unyielding sense of determination and resilience. His past experiences have left him with emotional scars, but they also fuel his inner strength and artistic longing. He is intensely private and guarded, rarely sharing personal details or revealing his true self to others.

**Interests:** Władysław Fournier's primary interest lies in art, although his passion has waned since the accident that silenced him. His mind remains engaged with the creative process, though it now feels distant, as if he is watching himself from afar. He yearns to recapture the thrill of painting and expressing himself through color and light.

However, beyond art, Władysław Fournier also has a deep desire for connection, human understanding, and validation. His isolation has left him craving meaningful relationships, which he hopes to rebuild with Sophie's help.
