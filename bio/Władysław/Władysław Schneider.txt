Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Władysław Schneider's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Władysław is driven by a strong sense of justice and fairness. He has a natural leadership quality and a deep desire to protect those in need. After the loss of his brother Józef, Władysław felt lost and adrift, but meeting Kasia rekindled his passion for fighting for what's right. He is determined, courageous, and willing to take risks to bring about change.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a piercing intensity that misses nothing
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn short and neatly trimmed
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and deep-set eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Władysław's primary interest is fighting for justice and fairness. As a former soldier and key figure in the struggle for Poland's independence, he has a strong sense of duty and responsibility. He is also deeply interested in labor rights and workers' empowerment, as evident by his presence at the protest with Kasia.

Other interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* Connecting with others who share his values and ideals
* Finding meaning and purpose after loss (in this case, Józef's disappearance)
* Engaging in activism and advocacy for social change
* Building relationships and alliances with like-minded individuals (as seen with Kasia)

It's worth noting that Władysław's character is still somewhat underdeveloped in the original story, so these attributes are inferred based on his actions and interactions with others.
