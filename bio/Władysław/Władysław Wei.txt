**Personality:**

Władysław is a complex individual, driven by a mix of emotions. He's a man of contradictions - charismatic on the surface but haunted by his past. He has an air of confidence and charm that serves him well in his art dealer persona, but beneath this facade lies a deep-seated sense of vulnerability. Władysław is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, which stems from years of living with the weight of secrets.

He's also intensely loyal to those he considers friends and will go to great lengths to protect them. This loyalty can sometimes manifest as an overprotectiveness, making it difficult for him to open up to new people or situations. Władysław has a dry sense of humor and often uses sarcasm as a defense mechanism.

**Interests:**

- Art Collecting: Władysław is highly knowledgeable about art and possesses a keen eye for valuable pieces.
- Whiskey Collection: He's an aficionado of fine whiskeys, with a vast collection that he enjoys sipping on during quiet moments like the one depicted in the short story.
- Surveillance and Espionage: Though he's retired from active espionage, Władysław still keeps an ear to the ground for rumors and leads related to old cases or current operations.
- Mystery Solving: With his years of experience as a spy, Władysław has developed an analytical mind that allows him to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.
- Wine Enthusiast: As part of his art dealer persona, he also appreciates fine wines.

Despite the allure of these interests, it's clear that Władysław is struggling with feelings of isolation and purposelessness. His encounters with Jacek have reignited a spark within him, leaving him more curious about the truth behind the art market than ever before.
