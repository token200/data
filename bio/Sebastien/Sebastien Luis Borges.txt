Based on the provided short story, I will create a fictional character profile for Sebastien Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastien is a slender, 5'9" (175 cm) tall Argentine with unruly dark brown hair and piercing emerald green eyes. His expressive face features high cheekbones, a small nose, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile. He has a scattering of freckles across his cheeks and nose, giving him a warm, earthy glow.

**Personality:** Sebastien is an artistic soul with a deep passion for music and storytelling. He is introspective, imaginative, and fiercely creative, often lost in his own thoughts and daydreams. His dry sense of humor and quick wit make him a charming conversationalist, but he can also be reserved and enigmatic at times. Sebastien is driven by his emotions, which he channels into his music to convey the complexities and contradictions of life.

**Interests:** As a musician, Sebastien's primary interest lies in exploring the intersections between art, music, and storytelling. He draws inspiration from the urban landscapes of Buenos Aires, its rich history, and the city's vibrant cultural heritage. Sebastien is fascinated by philosophy, literature, and poetry, often incorporating themes from these disciplines into his lyrics. His love for language, metaphor, and symbolism drives him to experiment with unconventional songwriting techniques.

In terms of specific interests outside of music, Sebastien enjoys:

* Attending avant-garde theater performances
* Exploring Buenos Aires' hidden bookstores and libraries (particularly those with rare volumes on mysticism and philosophy)
* Practicing yoga and meditation to clear his mind and focus his creativity
* Collecting antique guitars and instruments, each with its unique history and character

These attributes blend together to create a unique individual – Sebastien Luis Borges – who embodies the essence of Buenos Aires through his music, poetry, and soulful performances.
