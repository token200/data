Despite being surrounded by opulence and luxury, he feels stifled by expectations placed upon him and longs to bring about change. He's a listener, often preferring to observe and absorb information rather than speak his mind. However, when he does share his thoughts and feelings, he can be vulnerable and open-minded.

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastien stands at 6'2" with piercing green eyes that seem to hold a world of emotions within them. His hair is dark brown, often kept short and neat in the traditional Roman style. He has broad shoulders and a strong build, honed from years of riding and outdoor activities.

**Other Details:** Sebastien's ancestry is a mix of Germanic and Roman heritage, reflecting his unique blend of cultural influences. He has a scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident and a small tattoo of a wolf on his right wrist – a symbol of his ancestral heritage.
