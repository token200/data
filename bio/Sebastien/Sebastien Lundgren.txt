Here is a summary of Sebastien Lundgren's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sebastien is a charismatic and passionate individual with a strong work ethic. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks has instilled in him a determination and resilience that drives him to succeed. He has a tendency to get into trouble, but his music serves as an escape and a reminder of where he comes from. Despite his doubts and fears, Sebastien is fiercely dedicated to his craft and his fans.

**Physical Attributes:** Sebastien stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into the souls of those who meet him. His dark hair is often styled in a messy, piecey fashion that adds to his rockstar persona. He has a toned physique from years of performing live and maintaining an active lifestyle.

**Interests:** Music is Sebastien's primary passion, and he spends every waking moment thinking about his craft, writing songs, and perfecting his performance. He is deeply connected to the electric guitar and sees it as an extension of himself. In addition to music, Sebastien enjoys playing sports (basketball and soccer are particular favorites) and spending time with his loved ones. However, his drive and ambition often take precedence over other interests, leaving him little time for leisure activities.

It's worth noting that while the original story doesn't provide extensive information about Sebastien's physical attributes beyond eye color, I've filled in some additional details based on common rockstar archetypes.
