Here is a summary of Sebastien Malinowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sebastien Malinowska is an enigmatic and mysterious figure with a dry sense of humor. He exudes an air of confidence and intelligence, but his eyes glint with an otherworldly intensity that hints at a deeper understanding of the world. Despite his reclusive nature, he is drawn to those who are troubled or lost, sensing their own darkness within themselves. His passion for art is all-consuming, and he is willing to share it with others in order to connect with them on a deeper level.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue-green, like the first hints of spring after a long winter
* Hair: Dark brown, worn long and often unkempt, framing his face with wisps of tangled hair
* Skin Tone: Pale, almost translucent, with an ethereal quality that belies a life lived in the shadows
* Build: Lean and wiry, honed from years of solitary work and intense focus

**Interests:** Sebastien is deeply passionate about art, particularly those styles that explore the darker side of human experience. His fascination with death, decay, and the supernatural drives his creative process, as he seeks to capture the essence of the unknown in his paintings. He is also drawn to taxidermy, using it as a means of creating eerie and unsettling still-life compositions that serve as altarpieces for his art. When not working on canvas or arranging his taxidermied subjects, Sebastien can be found surrounded by candles, incense, and ancient tomes filled with forbidden knowledge.

Sebastien's interests also include the study of mythology, folklore, and the occult, which he believes inform his artistic vision and provide a deeper understanding of the world he seeks to capture through his art.
