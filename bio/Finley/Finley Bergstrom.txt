Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Finley Bergstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Finley is known for her fearless attitude and quick wit. She is undaunted by challenges and has an unyielding spirit that drives her to push beyond her limits. Her determination and focus are unwavering, even in the face of adversity.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue

Unfortunately, there's no information about Finley's height in the original story, so I had to make an educated guess. However, considering her athletic build and climbing background, it's likely that she has a slender yet muscular physique.

**Interests:** Finley is passionate about rock climbing and spends most of her free time honing her skills and preparing for new challenges. She has a personal connection with the rock faces, as if she can read their secrets, which suggests a deep respect and understanding of the natural world. Her love for adventure and pushing herself to the limit is evident in her fearless attitude and unwavering dedication.

Additional details that I added:

* Finley's hair color is likely blonde or light brown, given her bright blue eye color.
* She has a strong athletic build, honed from years of climbing and training.
* Her smile is radiant and confident, reflecting her sense of triumph and satisfaction.
* Despite her fearless attitude, she is not impulsive and takes the time to study routes and gather advice before tackling challenging climbs.
