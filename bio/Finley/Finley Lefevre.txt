**Personality:** Finley is a free-spirited individual who has always been drawn to his creative side. He's passionate about art and is not afraid to take risks to pursue his dreams. As a young artist, he was likely charismatic and confident, but over the years, the constraints of corporate life have tempered his enthusiasm. However, upon returning to Paris, Finley's spark is rekindled, and he's once again driven by a sense of purpose and creativity.

**Physical Attributes:** Finley stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a bright blue that seems to sparkle with creativity, and his hair is likely a rich, dark brown color that falls across his forehead in a way that frames his face. His style is effortless and bohemian, reflecting his artistic personality.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Finley values freedom and autonomy. He's drawn to the bohemian vibe of Montmartre, where he spent many formative years as a young artist.
