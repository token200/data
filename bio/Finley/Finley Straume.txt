Here is a summary of the fictional character Finley Straume's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Finley Straume appears to be a determined and curious individual, driven by a desire to uncover the truth about her family's past. She is observant but has historically struggled to fit in with her peers, suggesting that she may be introverted or creative types who prefer to observe rather than participate. Despite this, she shows determination and courage in the face of uncertainty, as evidenced by her willingness to investigate the cryptic message and approach the mysterious boat.

**Physical Attributes:** Finley Straume is described as someone who steps out of a misty morning air and into a dimly lit caf√©, suggesting that she may be a bit reserved or introverted. She is not given specific details about her physical appearance, but based on the description of her waiting in line to order coffee and taking a sip before walking back out into the morning air, it can be inferred that she is likely a young adult with a slender build.

**Height and Eye Color:** Unfortunately, there are no explicit mentions of Finley Straume's height. However, given the context of a small coastal town and a young woman who might walk to her car or coffee shop, it's possible that she is in her early twenties and relatively petite.

**Eye Color:** The text does not provide information about Finley Straume's eye color. 

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, photography appears to be one of Finley Straume's passions, serving as a means of escape from the pressures of small-town life. Her interest in uncovering the secrets of her family's past suggests that she is also drawn to genealogy and history.

It can be noted that very little about Finley Straume is explicitly stated.
