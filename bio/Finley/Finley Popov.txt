Finley is a deeply introspective and empathetic individual who is attuned to the natural world around him. He has a profound connection with plants and flowers, which allows him to sense their needs and desires.

He is also an avid observer of human behavior, fascinated by the ways in which people interact with the natural world. This interest has led him to develop a unique understanding of the emotional and psychological connections that exist between humans and the environment.

In his spare moments, Finley enjoys sketching and drawing the plants and flowers he encounters, as well as studying the symbolism and mythology surrounding various botanical species. His notebook is filled with sketches of flowers, trees, and other plants, each one accompanied by notes on their meanings and significance.
