Here is a summary of the fictional character Finley Poirier:

**Physical Attributes:** Finley stands at 5'11" with an athletic build. His piercing green eyes seem to sparkle with mischief, and his chiseled features give him a rugged charm. His dark brown hair is often perfectly messy, and he has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a past encounter.

**Personality:** Finley is known for his charismatic grin and quick wit, which have earned him a reputation as a skilled con artist. He is confident, resourceful, and adaptable, able to think on his feet to talk his way out of even the most precarious situations. Despite his rough exterior, Finley has a good heart and is not without empathy, which makes him a compelling and complex character.

**Interests:** Finley's interests include masterminding elaborate cons, studying the art of persuasion, and exploring the city's underbelly for new marks (or potential partners). He is fascinated by human psychology and behavior, often analyzing people to determine their weaknesses. In his free time, Finley enjoys sipping champagne, playing cards with his acquaintances, and indulging in good food and drink at New Orleans' finest establishments.

**Habits:** Finley has a habit of tapping his fingers on the surface when he's thinking or plotting. He also tends to whistle tunelessly when he's feeling confident or nervous. His eyes often light up when he senses an opportunity, and he can't resist the urge to charm those around him with his quick wit.

**Goals:** Finley's ultimate goal is to use his talents for good, while still maintaining a semblance of his carefree con artist lifestyle. He hopes to find a partner who shares his values and morals, but also understands that life as an outsider requires adaptability and cunning. For now, he's content to take on new challenges and see where they lead him â€“ as long as the champagne is flowing and the stakes are high!
