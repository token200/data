Here is a summary of the fictional character Finley Kaminska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Finley Kaminska is a man of quiet intensity, exuding an aura of mystery that commands respect. He is a skilled and deadly assassin with a calm demeanor, able to assess situations quickly and make calculated moves. Despite his reputation as untouchable, he seems to be driven by a sense of curiosity and justice, rather than purely mercenary motives.

**Physical Attributes:** Finley stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he encounters. His dark hair is often slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones that give him a chiseled appearance. He has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of martial arts training and hand-to-hand combat.

**Interests:** Finley appears to be deeply interested in the world of espionage and international intrigue, with a particular fascination for the darker corners of human nature. He is drawn to cases involving murder, corruption, and power struggles, where he can use his skills to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.

Despite his reputation as an assassin, Finley seems to be driven by a sense of purpose and moral conviction, rather than purely personal gain. He is a lone wolf, preferring to work alone and relying on his own wits and skills to get the job done. When not working, it can be assumed that he may have few social connections or interests outside of his line of work.

It's also possible that Finley has a certain affinity for the supernatural or occult, given his connection to his enigmatic father and the mention of "the darkness itself" in the story. However, this is not explicitly stated, and more information would be needed to confirm such an interest.
