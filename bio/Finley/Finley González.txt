**Physical Attributes:** Finley stands at approximately 5'10" with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a depth of emotion, a trait inherited from his artistic past.

**Personality:** Finley is a complex and introspective individual, haunted by the trauma of his mother's murder but driven by a deep sense of purpose. His unique blend of artistic intuition and forensic expertise allows him to approach crime scenes with a fresh perspective. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for vulnerable individuals and is fiercely protective of those he cares about.

**Interests:** Finley is passionate about art, not just as an outlet for self-expression but also as a way to understand the world around him. His love of art history, symbolism, and semiotics informs his approach to crime scene investigations. He is also deeply fascinated by psychology, particularly the motivations behind human behavior that leads to violent crimes. In his free time, he enjoys sketching, writing, and exploring the city's hidden corners, searching for inspiration in the urban landscape.

Finley's interests are not limited to art and science; he is also drawn to philosophy, poetry, and music.
