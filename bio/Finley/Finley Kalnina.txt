Here's a summary of Finley Kalnina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Finley Kalnina stands at around 6'1" with an athletic build, honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in high-risk activities. His hair is dark brown and often slicked back, revealing piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. A small scar above his left eyebrow and a sharp jawline add to his rugged appearance, making him appear even more intimidating than he actually is.

**Personality:**
Finley is a complex individual with a rich inner life. Beneath his tough exterior lies a quick wit, razor-sharp instincts, and an uncanny ability to read people. He has a charming facade that allows him to effortlessly manipulate others, but this also makes him vulnerable to those who see beyond the surface. Finley's past is marked by secrets and a multitude of faces, making it difficult for him to form genuine connections with others.

**Interests:**
Finley's interests are largely centered around his craft as a thief and con artist. He is always on the lookout for the next big score, and his mind is constantly racing with schemes and strategies to outsmart his marks. However, despite his tough exterior, Finley has a fascination with human psychology and behavior, often studying his victims' habits and patterns to better understand their motivations.

Finley's interests also extend beyond his professional life. He is an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and sociology in his rare moments of downtime. Music plays a significant role in Finley's life as well; he has a fondness for classical music and can often be found listening to Chopin or Mozart while planning his next move.

In addition to these interests, Finley has a deep-seated desire to understand the world around him and connect with others on a deeper level. Despite his tough exterior, he is haunted by feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which are slowly beginning to unravel in the presence of Lena, his trusted accomplice and potential confidante.
