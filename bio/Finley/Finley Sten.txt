Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Finley Sten:

**Physical Attributes:**
Finley Sten is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. He has an unassuming height, probably around 5'9" (175 cm), with a lean build that allows him to move freely through the city's crowded streets. His eye color is a deep brown that seems to hold a world of experience and weariness. His facial features are sharp, with high cheekbones and a nose that hints at his British heritage.

**Personality:**
Finley Sten is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a sharp intellect. He's been around the block enough times to know that nothing comes easily, but he's driven by a curiosity that propels him forward, even in the face of danger or uncertainty. His years as a private investigator have made him resourceful, observant, and patient – traits that serve him well in his line of work.

Finley is not a sentimental person, preferring to focus on facts and evidence rather than emotions or personal connections. However, he's not completely heartless; there's an underlying vulnerability to him, hinted at by the way he listens intently to Emma and the stranger, seeking to unravel the tangled threads of their stories.

**Interests:**
As a private investigator, Finley Sten has an innate interest in the dark corners of London's underbelly. He spends his evenings pouring over case files, interviewing witnesses, and navigating the city's hidden passages in search of clues. His work is often fueled by a desire for intellectual challenge and a need to understand the human psyche.

Outside of work, Finley appears to enjoy solitude, preferring the company of books, whiskey, and the city's smoky streets. He has a taste for the unusual and the inexplicable, as evident in his willingness to follow up on peculiar cases like Mrs. Jenkins' missing daughter. There's also a hint that he might be drawn to something more – perhaps the thrill of the unknown or the allure of secrets yet to be uncovered.

It's worth noting that Finley's interests seem to extend beyond just solving cases; there's an underlying mystery to him, a sense that his own story is waiting to be unraveled. This makes him a compelling and complex character, with layers to be peeled away as his story unfolds.
