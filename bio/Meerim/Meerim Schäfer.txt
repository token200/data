Here's a summary of Meerim Schäfer's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Meerim is a introspective and creative individual who finds solace in her work as a skilled woodcarver. She has a deep connection with nature and the stories that surround it, often weaving myths and secrets into her creations. Despite her love for storytelling, she's been withdrawn and hesitant to join in recently, possibly due to feelings of responsibility or a longing for quiet solitude.

**Physical Attributes:** Meerim is a slender woman with an unassuming presence. She stands approximately 5'4" (162 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are an earthy green color, reminiscent of the moss and stones found in the mountains she calls home.

**Interests:** Meerim is passionate about woodworking and storytelling, often combining these interests to create intricate wooden figurines that hold secrets and myths from her family's past. She loves hearing tales from others, especially those who have a deep connection with nature, and finds inspiration in the stories of her neighbors and friends. Her other interests include gardening (thanks to her sister Linnéa) and exploring the mountains and forests surrounding her village.

It seems that Meerim has a mix of artistic expression (through woodcarving), love for nature, and a desire for connection with others through storytelling. She's someone who finds solace in solitude but also values community and relationships, as evidenced by her interactions with Herr Müller and Linnéa.
