As a skilled huntress and member of the Wulfgar family, she has been shaped by her experiences as a leader and protector.

She is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will not hesitate to defend them.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Her eyes are a bright, piercing blue, with a sharp intelligence and depth that misses nothing.
* Hair: She has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied back in a practical knot for hunting or other physical pursuits.

**Interests:** Meerim Hebert is passionate about hunting, outdoor activities, and exploring the natural world.
