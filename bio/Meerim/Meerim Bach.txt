Based on the inspiration from Aurora Wynter, I've created a fictional character profile for Meerim Bach:

**Physical Attributes:**
Meerim Bach is a 27-year-old singer-songwriter with a unique and captivating presence. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an striking shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which seem to hold a deep intensity when she performs.

**Personality:**
Meerim Bach is a introspective and creative individual with a passion for storytelling through music. She is fiercely independent and values her artistic freedom above all else, often taking risks in her songwriting and performances to stay true to herself. Despite this, she has a kind and compassionate heart, which shines through in her lyrics and interactions with fans.

**Interests:**
Meerim Bach's musical influences range from folk to indie-folk, with a deep appreciation for the storytelling ability of classic singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan. She is also drawn to the poetic and literary traditions of European folklore, which often finds its way into her lyrics. When not writing or performing music, Meerim Bach enjoys hiking in nature, practicing yoga, and reading contemporary poetry and fiction.

Like Aurora Wynter, Meerim Bach aims to craft songs that are both deeply personal and universally relatable, exploring themes of love, loss, identity, and self-discovery through her lyrics. Her music is a reflection of her own experiences and emotions, filtered through the lens of her imagination and creativity.
