Here is a summary of Véronique Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Véronique is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, she presents herself as tough, confident, and ruthless in business dealings. However, beneath this exterior lies a kind, compassionate, and fiercely loyal person who will go to great lengths to support those she cares about. Her wit and quick tongue are razor-sharp, but they also hide a vulnerable soul that has been shaped by her difficult childhood and struggles with addiction.

**Physical Attributes:** Véronique stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet toned build. Her hair is dark brown and straight, often pulled back into a sleek ponytail. Her eyes are an intense shade of green, reflecting her sharp wit and perceptive nature. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of tattoos on her arms, hinting at a rebellious streak that she's carefully concealed.

**Interests:** Outside of work, Véronique enjoys practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being. She's an avid reader and loves devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and personal development. Her friends know that if you can get past her gruff exterior, she's always up for a lively debate or game night, where she can let loose and be herself.

Despite her tough exterior, Véronique is also passionate about social justice and philanthropy, often using her business acumen to support causes that align with her values. Her love of food and cooking is another hidden passion – in fact, she's been known to whip up a mean stir-fry or two when she's not too busy running the world.

As Véronique navigates her complicated past and present, it becomes clear that this multifaceted woman is far more than just a tough businesswoman – she's a rich tapestry of contradictions, full of depth, complexity, and vulnerability.
