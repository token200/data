Based on the short story, here is a summary of Véronique Dahir's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Véronique is likely in her mid-to-late twenties or early thirties. She has not been explicitly described as tall, but considering she is able to walk through the quiet streets with Pierre without difficulty, it can be inferred that she is of average height, possibly around 5'6" (168 cm). Her eye color is not specified, but given Pierre's striking green eyes, it would be surprising if hers were any different. Her hair and skin tone are not described either.

**Personality:**
Véronique appears to be a guarded individual who has built walls around herself to protect her from the past. She has been running for an extended period and is wary of strangers, as evidenced by her initial reaction to Pierre's approach. However, she also exhibits a strong sense of self-preservation and independence, which allows her to navigate unfamiliar situations with confidence. Her intuition tells her to flee when meeting Pierre at first, but as the conversation unfolds, she becomes increasingly open and receptive.

**Interests:**
Véronique seems to be drawn to art or creative pursuits, as evidenced by Pierre's description of him as a writer and traveler who appreciates secrets. The fact that Véronique finds herself feeling seen and understood by Pierre in his company suggests that she values authenticity and may be searching for something meaningful. Her willingness to open up to Pierre and share her stories implies that she is looking for connection and understanding, which could indicate a passion for storytelling or a desire for meaningful relationships.

Overall, Véronique's personality is characterized by her guarded nature, independence, and search for authenticity and connection.
