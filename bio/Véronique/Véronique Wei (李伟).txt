Here is a summary of Véronique Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Véronique Wei, also known as Lee Wei, is a woman in her mid-twenties. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall and has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an arresting shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with curiosity when discussing art or philosophy.

**Personality:**
Véronique is a introspective and empathetic individual with a deep passion for art, self-discovery, and human connection. She is a natural listener, often lost in thought as she absorbs the words of others, much like Mr. Wong's wisdom had a profound impact on her early life. Her quiet confidence and genuine interest in others make her an endearing presence in social settings. Véronique is also fiercely independent, having grown up with privilege but never feeling truly at home in her family's wealth; this ambivalence has helped shape her unique perspective.

**Interests:**
Véronique Wei is deeply invested in the world of art, not just as a collector or connoisseur, but as a way to understand herself and others. She finds solace in discussions about philosophy, psychology, and existentialism, which often intersect with her artistic explorations. Her experiences at Mr. Wong's gallery have broadened her appreciation for local artists, contemporary trends, and the emotional resonance of art. Véronique is also drawn to literature, particularly poetry and 19th-century novels, which offer insight into the human condition.

As she delves deeper into the art world, Lee Wei discovers an affinity for painting, printmaking, and sculpture – mediums that allow her to express emotions, explore abstract concepts, and create something meaningful with her own hands.
