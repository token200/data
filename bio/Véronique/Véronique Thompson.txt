**Physical Attributes:** Véronique stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an athletic yet toned physique, likely developed from years of physical activity and high-stress situations. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a practical and understated manner to blend in with her surroundings. Her eyes are an arresting shade of blue-green, almost indigo, which may be mistaken for the green eyes mentioned by Pierre's contact.

**Personality:** Véronique appears to be highly intelligent, resourceful, and calculating, with a keen sense of observation and intuition that allows her to navigate complex social situations. She is also deeply driven, both physically and mentally, as evidenced by her extensive training and dedication to her mission. This driven personality may sometimes put her at odds with those around her, but it also enables her to stay focused under pressure.

She is skilled in multiple languages, which suggests a keen interest in cultural nuances and global politics. Her experience as an undercover agent has also instilled in her a strong sense of adaptability and resilience. Outside of her professional life, it is unclear what specific interests or hobbies Véronique might enjoy, but it can be inferred that she values efficiency, effectiveness, and precision in all aspects of her life.
