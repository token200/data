Based on my research, I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mārtiņš Huffington. However, since we are working from the video game series "Mass Effect," I will create a character profile for Marti Hoffman.

Marti Hoffman is a human Spectre in the Mass Effect universe. Physically, she stands at 5'8" with piercing blue eyes and shoulder-length dark brown hair. Her athletic build and toned physique reflect her extensive training as an agent of the Citadel Council.

In terms of personality, Marti Hoffman is highly intelligent and resourceful, often relying on her wit and cunning to get out of challenging situations. She is fiercely loyal to her team and will stop at nothing to protect them from harm. However, she also has a tendency to be somewhat reckless, which can sometimes put herself and others in danger.

Marti's interests lie in the field of advanced biotechnology, particularly genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Her unique perspective as a Spectre allows her to approach problems from multiple angles, often incorporating cutting-edge technology to inform her decisions. She is also deeply passionate about improving the lives of those affected by the Reaper threat and finding new ways to combat these destructive forces.

If you would like to continue with Marti's story or create a new character for me, please let me know!
