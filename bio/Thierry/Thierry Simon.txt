Here is a summary of Thierry Simon's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thierry is a quiet and introspective individual who has built walls around himself after being ostracized by his peers. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a sharp mind and a deep sense of curiosity. He is intensely observant and analytical, having honed these skills as a private investigator. Despite his tough exterior, Thierry is vulnerable to the idea that he may have been "served" by someone who understands him - a feeling that Sophie's presence evokes in him.

**Physical Attributes:** Thierry stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) with an unassuming build. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, while his eyes are a piercing green that seems to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his earlier investigations.

**Interests:** Thierry's primary interest lies in books, particularly rare and obscure volumes that hold secrets and stories within their pages. As the owner of "Les Pages Perdus", he spends most of his days surrounded by dusty tomes, lost in the world of fiction and imagination. He has a deep passion for mystery novels and has a keen eye for detecting hidden patterns and meanings beneath the surface. Outside of his bookstore, Thierry is fascinated by the art of observation, often finding himself drawn to the intricate details that others might overlook.

While Thierry's life had been quiet and solitary, Sophie's arrival has awakened something within him - a sense of possibility and purpose that he thought was lost forever. As they delve into the secrets of "Les Secrets de la Nuit", Thierry finds himself rediscovering his passion for life and unraveling the mysteries that have haunted him for so long.
