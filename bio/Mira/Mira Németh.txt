Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Mira NÃ©meth's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mira appears to be a creative and introspective person. She spends most of her days alone in her studio apartment, lost in her own world of words and colors. This suggests that she values solitude and may be someone who needs time to herself to recharge. At the same time, she is drawn to people-watching and connecting with others, which indicates that she is curious and empathetic.

When Mira meets the stranger at the bar, she feels a connection form between them, suggesting that she is open to new relationships and willing to take risks. Her decision to approach him and strike up a conversation demonstrates her confidence and social skills.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much information about Mira's physical appearance beyond her eye color. However, based on the context and tone of the narrative, I would imagine that she is likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. Her height is not specified, but considering her slender build and artistic nature, she might be petite.

**Eye Color:** Mira's eye color is described as brown, which suggests a warm and earthy appearance. This complements her creative and introspective personality, hinting at a rich inner world.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Mira is a freelance writer and artist. She spends most of her days lost in her own world of words and colors, indicating that she values creativity and self-expression. Her interest in people-watching and connecting with others suggests that she is curious about human nature and relationships.

Additionally, Mira appears to be an observer of the world around her, taking note of the details and nuances of everyday life. This curiosity could be a trait shared by many creatives, who often find inspiration in the ordinary and unexpected.

**Additional Details:** Given her artistic background, I imagine that Mira's interests might also include music, literature, or other forms of creative expression. Her love for writing and drawing suggests that she values self-expression and has a deep connection to her art.

However, without more information from the story, it's difficult to say for certain what specific interests Mira enjoys outside of writing and art.
