Here is a summary of Mira Kov√°cs' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mira is a brilliant, reclusive mathematician who has spent most of her life studying fractals. She was previously isolated and focused on her work, with little room for social interactions or personal relationships. However, through her correspondence with her sister Sofia, she begins to open up and reveals a more vulnerable side. Mira's personality is complex, with a strong sense of curiosity and passion for mathematics.

**Physical Attributes:** Mira has an unassuming physical presence. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with slender build. Her eye color is an unsettling shade of pale blue, almost indigo, which may be reminiscent of the colors she associates with fractal geometry. Her dark hair is often worn in a neat, but slightly unkempt bun.

**Interests:** Mira's primary interest is mathematics, specifically fractals and their intricate patterns. She has spent years studying these self-similar shapes, which have become an integral part of her identity. However, through her correspondence with Sofia, she begins to see the world in different colors, both literally (shades of blue and red) and metaphorically. Mira starts to appreciate the beauty of human connection and the complexity of the world around her.

In addition to mathematics, Mira has a deep appreciation for patterns and order, which is reflected in her handwriting and overall demeanor. She is also drawn to the art of weaving intricate connections between seemingly disparate concepts, much like she does with fractals.

It's worth noting that Mira's personality, physical attributes, and interests are closely tied to her mathematical passion. Her experiences and relationships with others shape her perception of the world, causing her to see patterns and beauty in unexpected places.
