Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Mira García Márquez:

**Physical Attributes:** Mira stands at around 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and often worn in a messy bun, framing her heart-shaped face and expressive eyes - which are a deep shade of hazel that seem to sparkle with curiosity. She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small tattoo of a camera on her left wrist.

**Personality:** Mira is a free-spirited and enigmatic individual, often lost in thought as she explores the city's hidden corners. Despite growing up under the weight of family expectations, she has forged her own path and is fiercely independent. Her creative energy is boundless, and she has an uncanny ability to connect with the world around her - whether it's through photography or simply observing life.

**Interests:** Mira's true passions lie in photography and storytelling. She spends most of her days exploring La Candelaria, capturing the vibrant colors and textures of the city on film. Her camera is always slung over her shoulder, waiting to be put to use as she wanders through streets and alleys, uncovering hidden gems and secrets.

In addition to her love of photography, Mira has a deep fascination with history and storytelling - particularly those tales that have been lost or forgotten over time. She senses the city is alive and whispering stories in its own voice if one knows where to listen.
