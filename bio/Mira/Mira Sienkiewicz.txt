**Interests:** Mira's true passions lie in mathematics (particularly advanced calculus and topology), contortionism, and exploring the fluid boundaries between self and world. She is also fascinated by chaos theory and its application to human existence. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain balance and flexibility in both body and mind.

As a mathematician, Mira has a natural curiosity about the underlying structures of the universe, which fuels her interest in contortionism as an art form that challenges conventional notions of space and movement.
