**Physical Attributes:** Mira Bērziņa stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with long, curly brown hair and expressive green eyes that seem to sparkle with warmth. Her features are delicate yet striking, giving her an ethereal quality that belies her strong connection to the natural world.

**Interests:** Mira Bērziņa is deeply passionate about animal welfare and conservation. She spends much of her time exploring the forests and meadows surrounding Cesis, communing with creatures great and small.
