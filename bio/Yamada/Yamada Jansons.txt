**Personality:**
Yamada Jansons is an introverted and enigmatic individual. He possesses a dry wit and a subtle sense of humor, which he only reveals to those close enough to decipher the code of his thoughts. His reserve stems from years of dealing with the pressures of the creative world, where one's innermost self must often be kept hidden behind masks.

Despite this introverted nature, Yamada Jansons has an immense capacity for empathy and understandingâ€” traits that Akane Nakamura discovers in him as she uncovers more about his writing process. This duality makes him intriguingly complex and multi-dimensional.

**Interests:**

He draws inspiration from these themes to weave intricate webs of intrigue in his stories. In his leisure time, he enjoys reading (particularly works by Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, and other Gothic masterminds), playing the guitar, collecting rare books, and composing poetry.

His love for solitude is deeply rooted in his passion for writing, which allows him to tap into the depths of human suffering and explore the uncharted territories of the soul.
