Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I have created a fictional character profile for Yamada Szymańska:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep Brown
* Hair Color: Dark Brown, often worn in a neat and tidy bob
* Skin Tone: Olive with a subtle golden glow from years of spending time outdoors

**Personality:**

Yamada Szymańska is an introverted yet intensely passionate individual. She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof to those who don't know her. However, once you gain her trust, she reveals a warm and kind heart that is driven by a deep love for discovery and learning. Her focus on her work can sometimes make her appear distant or preoccupied, but it's only because she is so deeply invested in unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

**Interests:**

* Astronomy (of course!)
* Reading scientific texts and academic papers
* Conducting experiments and analyzing data
* Exploring the night sky with a telescope
* Collecting rare astronomical artifacts and books on stargazing history
* Practicing yoga to maintain mental clarity and balance

Additional Details:

* Yamada Szymańska has a small tattoo of a star chart on her left wrist, which she got as a young woman.
* She is an avid fan of classical music, particularly Chopin and Debussy.
* Despite her international recognition, Szymańska still lives in a modest apartment near the observatory where she works.
