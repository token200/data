Based on the story about Yulisa Kabylbekova, I can create a fictional character profile for Yamada Kabylbekova:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Chestnut Brown
* Skin Tone: Olive with a warm undertone
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, small nose, and full lips

**Personality:**
Yamada Kabylbekova is a curious and driven individual with a passion for storytelling. She is fiercely independent and determined to uncover the truth about her family's history. Yamada values knowledge and learning above all else, often putting in long hours of research and investigation to uncover hidden secrets. Despite her drive, she has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards those who have been marginalized or oppressed.

**Interests:**

* Historical Research
* Cultural Preservation
* Journalism
* Music (traditional Kazakh music)
* Reading (especially books on history, anthropology, and sociology)
* Hiking and Outdoor Activities

Note that I've taken some creative liberties to make Yamada a distinct character from Yulisa Kabylbekova. If you'd like me to make any changes or adjustments, please let me know!
