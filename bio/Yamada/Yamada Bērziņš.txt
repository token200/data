Based on the provided story about Yūta Yamada's encounter with Yūichi Bērziņš, I have created a fictional character profile for Yamada Bērziņš:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue with a golden tint
* Hair Color: Wild gray hair that is often unkempt and wispy
* Facial Features: Strong, angular face with bushy eyebrows and a pointed chin

**Personality:**
Yamada Bērziņš appears to be an eccentric and enigmatic individual with a rich history. He has an air of mystery surrounding him, which makes people curious about his past and motivations. Despite this, he is warm and welcoming, particularly towards those who share his passion for collecting rare artifacts. His eyes sparkle with excitement when discussing the intricacies of his collection, indicating a deep love and knowledge of the items he gathers.

**Interests:**

* Collecting rare and obscure artifacts
* Traveling to explore new places and discover hidden treasures
