Here's a summary of Erik Pawlak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Erik is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He has a strong sense of determination and resilience, which drives him to keep fighting against his former life as a hitman for the Red Viper gang. Despite his rough start, he shows signs of vulnerability and a deep-seated desire to leave his past behind and start anew. However, his instincts remain sharp, and he is fiercely independent and non-conformist.

**Physical Attributes:** Erik stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of manual labor and intense physical activity. His hair is dark brown, often unkempt and styled in a messy fashion. His eyes are piercing blue, with a sharp, intelligent glint that misses nothing. His features are chiseled, with high cheekbones and a strong jawline.

**Interests:** As Erik navigates his new life in Oakdale, he appears to be interested in mechanics, fixer-upper cars, and tinkering with engines. He has taken on the identity of "Mike" and is working as a mechanic at the local garage, which seems to be a source of solace and stability for him. However, it's clear that his true interests lie in keeping a low profile, staying under the radar, and protecting himself from his past mistakes.

Some additional details that were not explicitly mentioned in the original story but can be inferred:

* Erik has a dry sense of humor and is often sarcastic, which he uses as a defense mechanism to mask his true emotions.
* He has a strong sense of loyalty to those he considers friends and will go to great lengths to protect them.
* Despite his tough exterior, Erik has a deep emotional scar from his past experiences, particularly related to the Red Viper gang. This trauma continues to affect him even after leaving his life behind.

These details aim to flesh out Erik's character while staying true to the spirit of the original story.
