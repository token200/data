Here's a summary of Erik Adelberg's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Erik is a introspective and melancholic person. He struggles with feelings of guilt, regret, and loss after his accident, which has left him feeling trapped between worlds. Despite this, he exhibits resilience and determination as he tries to communicate with his wife's ghost and find a way to move on.

As the story progresses, Erik shows signs of hope and optimism, particularly when he connects with Sarah's ghost. He is driven by a desire to be reunited with his loved ones and to escape the pain of his own mortality.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Erik is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, around 6 feet tall (183 cm), which was a typical height range for men at that age.
* Eye Color: His eyes are described as "a piercing blue" that seem to hold a deep sadness and introspection.

**Interests:** It can be inferred that Erik is an intelligent and driven individual with a strong focus on his business career. As the story suggests, he was a successful businessman before his accident, which implies that he has a high level of ambition and dedication to his work.

However, after being trapped in limbo, Erik's interests may shift from material success to more spiritual or emotional pursuits. He seems to find solace in communicating with Sarah's ghost and contemplating the meaning of life, death, and the afterlife. These new interests suggest a deeper exploration of human connection, love, and the complexities of mortality.

Overall, Erik Adelberg appears to be a complex and multi-dimensional character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are shaped by his tragic circumstances and his journey towards self-discovery.
