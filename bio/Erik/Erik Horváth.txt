Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Erik Horváth:

**Personality:** Erik is a stoic and introspective person who has learned to mask his emotions, particularly after losing his wife Lívia. However, he still holds onto deep feelings of love, loss, and nostalgia. He is a resilient individual who has built a life for himself and his daughter Szofi despite the pain of their past. Erik's personality is characterized by his quiet strength, determination, and capacity to create new memories with those around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Erik is not explicitly described in terms of height and eye color, but we can make some assumptions based on his age and profession. Given that he works as an English teacher at a local language school, it's likely that he is in his late 40s or early 50s. His height is unknown, but he seems slender enough to be able to fit comfortably in his small apartment.

**Interests:** Erik has a passion for reading and painting, which served as creative outlets for him during a difficult time. These interests helped him cope with the loss of Lívia and find solace in the present moment. He also enjoys spending quality time with Szofi and creating new memories with her. His interest in photography is hinted at through Szofi's budding interest in it.

It's worth noting that Erik's personality, physical attributes, and interests are not as fully fleshed out as those of some characters, which may be due to the short story being a introspective, character-driven piece rather than an action-oriented plot-driven narrative.
