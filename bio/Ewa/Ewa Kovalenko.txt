Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ewa Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ewa Kovalenko is described as having an "unwavering determination" and being driven by her passion for uncovering the secrets of the past. She is highly intelligent, with a keen mind that enables her to decipher ancient texts and interpret artifacts. Her colleagues joke about her obsession, but it's clear that she is intensely focused on her work.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, we don't have much information about Ewa's physical appearance in the short story, so I'll make some educated guesses:

* Height: Ewa appears to be a tall and slender woman. She may stand around 5'9" (175 cm) or taller.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are dark brown, which complements her determined and focused personality.

**Interests:** As an archaeologist, Ewa's primary interest is in uncovering the secrets of the past, particularly those related to the lost city of Zerzura. She is passionate about understanding ancient civilizations, languages, and cultures. Her interests likely extend beyond archaeology, as she is mentioned to be taking on the next challenge after uncovering the secrets of Zerzura.

It's worth noting that some details about Ewa's physical appearance are left to the reader's imagination, such as her hair color, skin tone, or any notable features. However, based on her personality and interests, I've tried to provide a comprehensive summary of what we can infer about her from the short story.
