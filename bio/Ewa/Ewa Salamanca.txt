Ewa Salamanca is portrayed as a strong-willed, intelligent, and resourceful individual with a quiet confidence that commands attention. She has grown accustomed to being overlooked but has developed an air of self-reliance, which serves her well in high-pressure situations like the one she finds herself in when the young man arrives at her doorstep seeking help. Ewa's demeanor can shift from skepticism to compassion quickly, as seen when she listens to the young man's tale and begins to show empathy towards him.

**Interests:**

- Justice and power dynamics: As the youngest Lannister sister, she has grown accustomed to being underestimated, yet she remains committed to using her position to influence events in a way that benefits those who have been overlooked.

Ewa's interests also seem to extend beyond mere personal ambition. Her willingness to help someone accused of treason despite their supposed wrongdoings suggests a deeper desire for justice and understanding, particularly among those who feel marginalized or oppressed by the ruling elite.

Overall, Ewa Salamanca is complex character with multifaceted interests that blur the lines between traditional notions of loyalty and duty in a world where power can be both a means to an end and an ultimate goal.
