Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ewa Aurelius Antoninus Augustus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ewa appears to be a determined and strong-willed individual. She feels like an outsider among her own people, having grown up in the shadow of power without truly belonging to it. This has driven her to prove herself as more than just her birthright. Her determination and conviction are evident in her actions, as she is ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead with courage and conviction.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no details about Ewa's physical appearance provided in the short story. However, based on her title (Ewa Aurelius Antoninus Augustus), it can be inferred that she holds a high-ranking position in Roman society, possibly making her an older woman or at least middle-aged.

It is likely that Ewa is of average to above-average height for a woman during this time period, with some historical accounts suggesting that Roman women were generally around 5'2" (157 cm) tall. Her eye color is not specified in the story, but it's possible that she has dark or hazel eyes due to her ancestral heritage.

**Interests:** Ewa seems to be deeply interested in politics and strategy, as evidenced by her attention during a meeting with the Emperor where he outlines his campaign strategy. She is also an outdoorsy person, enjoying time spent under the desert sun, exploring the vast dunes of Palmyra's oasis.

It appears that Ewa values strength, courage, and leadership above all else, driven in part by a desire to prove herself as more than just her family's name.
