Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ewa Berzina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ewa seems to be a curious and observant person. She is able to notice small details about someone that make them seem familiar, even if they don't quite match up with her expectations. She also appears to be emotional, as evidenced by the wave of unease she feels when waiting for Katarzyna in line and the mix of relief and confusion that follows their reunion.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Ewa's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on the way she interacts with others (e.g., having to hover her hand over someone's shoulder before sitting down), it appears that she is of average height or slightly above average.
* Eye Color: Ewa's eye color is not specified in the story, but based on the fact that the woman who doppelgangers Katarzyna has piercing green eyes, it seems likely that Ewa's own eye color could be green as well. However, this is purely speculative and may not be accurate.

**Interests:** Based on the way Ewa interacts with her sister Katarzyna over coffee, it appears that she enjoys small talk and casual conversations. She also seems to have an interest in observing people and noticing details about them, which is evident when she notices a woman sitting alone by the window who looks vaguely familiar.

Overall, Ewa's personality is characterized by her curiosity, emotional depth, and interest in observing others.
