Here's a summary of Ewa Bērziņš' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Ewa is described as having an "unassuming demeanor" and soft-spoken nature, which allows her to blend into a crowd. However, this doesn't mean she's introverted or shy. She has a quiet confidence and determination that drives her creativity. Despite her artistic success, Ewa remains humble and willing to share her expertise with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story doesn't provide specific details about Ewa's physical attributes. However, based on the fact that she was born in Riga, Latvia, it's likely that she has a Slavic appearance, perhaps with features common among Latvian or Baltic people (e.g., dark hair, eyes, and skin tone).

Assuming an average height for a woman of her nationality, let's say Ewa stands at around 5'6" to 5'8". Her eye color could be a bright brown or green, reminiscent of the country's natural landscape.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Ewa is deeply passionate about art and teaching. She finds inspiration in the world around her, often taking long walks through Riga's Old Town to observe its architecture and details. Her love for nature and history influences her abstract expressionist style.

In addition to painting, Ewa likely enjoys exploring abandoned spaces, like the forgotten courtyard that inspired her own work. This curiosity might also extend to other creative pursuits, such as photography or writing.
