Here is a summary of Ewa Maria's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ewa Maria is an inquisitive and determined individual. She has a deep love for mythology and the natural world, which drives her to learn as much as she can about these subjects. Despite being teased by her friends for her "nerdy" interests, Ewa Maria remains passionate and focused on her goals. She is also fiercely curious and open-minded, willing to listen to new ideas and perspectives.

**Physical Attributes:** Ewa Maria's full name is Ewa Maria Kowalska. She has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an expressive shade of green, a trait she inherited from her grandmother. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm), with a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of exploring the woods and hiking.

**Interests:** Ewa Maria's love for mythology is all-consuming, driving her to read books and attend lectures on the subject. Her favorite mythological creatures include the Leshy, a forest spirit said to inhabit the Polish woods, and the Wilga, a mythical bird believed to possess healing properties. She is also fascinated by the ancient gods of Poland, such as Perun, the god of thunder, and Mokosh, the goddess of fertility. In addition to mythology, Ewa Maria has a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors, often spending hours exploring the woods near her village.

It's worth noting that while there is no specific mention of Ewa Maria's age in the original story, I've assumed she is likely in her late teens or early twenties based on her academic pursuits and personal development.
