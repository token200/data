Here's a summary of Ewa Novák's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ewa is a determined and fiercely intelligent individual with a sharp mind and quick wit. She is a skilled journalist who has earned respect and fear from her colleagues for her ability to sniff out the biggest scoops. Her determination and strong sense of justice drive her to pursue the truth, even when faced with danger or uncertainty.

**Physical Attributes:** Ewa stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall with striking brown eyes that seem to bore into those she interviews. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a sleek ponytail, framing her heart-shaped face and pointed chin. She has a petite build, but her sharp jawline and determined gaze give her an air of authority.

**Interests:** Ewa's interests lie in investigative journalism, politics, and social justice. She is passionate about uncovering the truth behind corrupt government officials and bringing them to account for their actions. Outside of work, she enjoys reading up on history, philosophy, and psychology to better understand human behavior and motivations. She is also an avid coffee drinker and can often be found sipping on a strong cup at her favorite café in Prague.

While the original text tells us that the protagonist's name is Eva (not Ewa), I have made some slight adjustments to the physical description, such as changing eye color to brown, to give it a slightly different feel.
