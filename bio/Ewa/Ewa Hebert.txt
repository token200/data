**Personality:**
Ewa Helena Kowalska Hebert is a multifaceted individual with two distinct sides to her personality. By day, she exudes warmth and kindness as the owner of the local bakery. Her infectious laughter and cheerful demeanor draw people from all over the county to her shop. However, by night, Ewa transforms into "Eva," a literary enthusiast who is not afraid to express her opinions or share her own writing with others. She has a secret passion for storytelling that sets her apart as a creative force in the community.

**Interests:**
Ewa's love for baking serves as the foundation of her life, providing comfort and joy to those around her. Her bakery is more than just a business; it's an extension of herself where she shares her warmth and creativity with others. Outside of work, Ewa has a deep passion for literature, particularly reading and writing stories that explore themes of mystery, identity, and community. She finds solace in the written word, using it to express herself authentically when "Eva" is on stage.

The boundaries between her two personas blur beautifully as she engages with both her readers at the bakery and the book club members who know her better. This dichotomy highlights Ewa's incredible capacity for self-expression and her desire to share different facets of herself with the world, enriching her life through her writing and baking alike.
