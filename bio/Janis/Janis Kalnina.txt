**Personality:**
Janis Kalnina is a brilliant and reclusive scientist who appears to be guarded and defensive due to her private nature. However, as she opens up to Sarah, it becomes clear that beneath her reserved exterior lies a deeply sensitive soul with complex emotions and insecurities. Janis seems introspective and quiet, often lost in thought, suggesting that she is a reflective and contemplative person.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: Janis stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm), which is slightly above average height.
- Eye Color: Her eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost piercing, which may reflect her sharp intellect and keen observational skills.
- Other Physical Features: Little is mentioned about Janis's physical appearance, but it can be inferred that she has a slender yet athletic build, suggesting she values health and fitness. Her dark hair is unkempt and often falls in loose waves down her back.

**Interests:**
Janis is deeply passionate about understanding the human brain and its functions, particularly when it comes to neural networks and artificial intelligence. She finds inspiration in philosophical works like Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" and spends a significant amount of time pondering existential questions that underpin her scientific pursuits.

However, Janis's primary motivation is driven by personal loss due to Alzheimer's disease affecting her loved ones, which underscores the compassionate side of her personality. Her research on brain-computer interfaces can be seen as an attempt to regain control over this uncontrollable force, thus striving for a deeper comprehension of human consciousness and seeking ways to prevent or mitigate similar tragedies in the future.
