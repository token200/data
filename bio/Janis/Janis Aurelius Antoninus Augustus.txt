Based on the inspiration from the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Janis Aurelius Antoninus Augustus:

**Physical Attributes:** Janis stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet elegant build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that falls in loose waves down her back, and her piercing green eyes sparkle with intelligence and determination. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, hinting at her mixed heritage.

**Personality:** Janis is a force to be reckoned with - intelligent, charismatic, and unapologetically ambitious. She possesses a natural air of authority, which she exudes through her confident demeanor and sharp wit. Despite her adopted father's influence, Janis has carved out her own path in life, driven by a passion for politics and statesmanship. Her strong sense of self-worth and conviction have earned her the respect of those around her.

**Interests:** Janis is deeply interested in diplomacy, trade agreements, and international relations. She has spent countless hours studying under her adoptive father's guidance, learning about Rome's history, politics, and cultural dynamics. Her other interests include philosophy (particularly Stoicism), music (she plays the lyre), and literature (she's an avid reader of Greek authors). Janis is also a skilled horseback rider and enjoys taking long rides along the Roman countryside.

**Habits:** Despite her poised exterior, Janis has a habit of biting her lower lip when deep in thought or feeling anxious. She often uses this behavior to conceal her emotions, allowing her to focus on the task at hand. In quieter moments, she is known to jot down notes and ideas in her leather-bound journal, which she carries with her everywhere.

**Goals:** Janis's ultimate goal is to become a respected leader in Rome, utilizing her skills to promote peace, prosperity, and cultural exchange between nations. She envisions a future where the Roman Empire expands its influence through diplomacy rather than conquest, creating a more harmonious world order.
