Despite this, they have learned to channel these feelings into their writing, which has become a source of solace and empowerment for them. Janis is fiercely independent and values their alone time, but they also crave deep connections with others. They are intensely introspective and may come across as aloof or intimidating to those who don't know them.

**Interests:** As a writer, Janis is deeply passionate about literature, poetry, and storytelling. They have an extensive library of books on various subjects, including philosophy, psychology, and mythology. Music also plays a significant role in their life, as they find solace in the works of classical composers like Chopin and Debussy.

Janis is particularly drawn to the works of authors like Samuel Beckett, Virginia Woolf, and Toni Morrison, who share similar themes of isolation, redemption, and the human condition. They also enjoy taking long walks in nature, observing the way light falls on trees and the patterns of clouds drifting across the sky.

In their free time, Janis might be found journaling, practicing yoga, or sipping tea by a warm candlelight, lost in the world of words they've created.
