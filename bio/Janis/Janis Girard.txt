**Physical Attributes:**
Janis "JD" Girard stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet curves-honed physique. Her eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a world of emotions within them. Her hair is a wild tangle of curly black locks that often falls in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist and a scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Janis is a force to be reckoned with - intense, passionate, and unapologetic. She has a fiery spirit that drives her to create music that speaks truth to power and tells the stories of those who need to be heard. Despite her tough exterior, Janis has a vulnerable side that she only reveals when she's on stage or with her closest friends. She is fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them.

**Interests:**
Janis's interests are centered around music, specifically the blues genre. She spends hours poring over vinyl records of classic blues musicians like Bessie Smith and Robert Johnson, studying their lyrics and instrumentation. When not on stage or rehearsing with The Blackwater Serenaders, Janis enjoys taking long walks through the French Quarter, sipping coffee at a local caf√©, and reading poetry and literature.
