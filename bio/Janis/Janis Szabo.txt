However, once you get to know her, she can be open and passionate about her craft.

**Physical Attributes:** Janis Szabo is approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, curly brown hair that often escapes her ponytail.

She has a small scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident and wears faded tattoos on her ankles, including the image of a peacock, which holds personal significance for her.
