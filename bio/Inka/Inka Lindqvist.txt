Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Inka Lindqvist:

**Personality:** Inka appears to be a determined and passionate individual, driven by her commitment to environmental causes. She is also introspective and possibly melancholic, as indicated by her need for a break from her city-bred life after a grueling assignment went sour. Her willingness to help out with Linnéa's eco-museum project suggests that she is kind-hearted and willing to support friends in need.

**Physical Attributes:** Inka's physical attributes are not explicitly described in the story, but based on her height and eye color, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height would give Inka a slightly above-average stature, allowing her to be visible in crowds without being overshadowed.
* Eye Color: Green or hazel eyes - The mention of "the stars twinkling overhead" during her speech on the night of the festival suggests that she has a connection to nature, and green or hazel eyes would complement this theme.

**Interests:** Inka's primary interest is environmental conservation. Her passion for this cause drives her to help out with Linnéa's eco-museum project, which aligns with her personal values. She also appears to have an appreciation for the natural beauty of her hometown, Åre, and finds solace in its quiet charms.

In addition to her environmental interests, Inka seems to value her relationships with others, as evident from her close friendship with Linnéa and her willingness to support her friend's project.
