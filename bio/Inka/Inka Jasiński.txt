Based on the inspiration provided by the short story about Inka Jasiński, I have created a fictional character profile:

**Name:** Inka Jasiński

**Age:** 25

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright hazel with golden undertones
* Hair: Dark brown, wavy, and shoulder-length, often tied back in a ponytail when working or traveling.
* Build: Athletic and toned, honed from years of hiking, climbing, and excavating.

**Personality:** Inka is an intelligent, resourceful, and determined individual with a passion for history and archaeology. She is fiercely independent, driven by her curiosity and desire to uncover the truth about Mazowiec. Her obsession often leads her to take risks and push boundaries, but she is also fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Interests:**

* Archaeology and history, particularly Eastern European and Slavic civilizations.
* Geocaching and map-reading

**Background:** Growing up in Poland, Inka was always fascinated by the country's rich history and mythology. She spent countless hours studying and exploring local legends and stories about Mazowiec, which ultimately led her to become an archaeologist. Her search for the truth has taken her across the Polish countryside, from crumbling castles to abandoned mines, and has finally led her to uncover the secrets of the ancient city.
