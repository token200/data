**Personality:** Inka is a complex and intense individual with a deep-seated anger and resentment towards the world. She is fiercely independent and determined, with an unyielding passion for boxing that drives her to succeed. Her past experiences on the streets have left emotional scars, but they also fuel her determination to overcome adversity and prove herself as a formidable opponent. Despite her tough exterior, there may be glimpses of vulnerability and introspection beneath the surface.

**Physical Attributes:** Inka stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build that speaks to her dedication to boxing. Her eyes are a striking shade of piercing green, which seem to hold a world of fury and emotion when she's on the ring. Her hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often pulled back in a ponytail to showcase her face. She has a small tattoo of a boxing glove on her left bicep and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood injury.
