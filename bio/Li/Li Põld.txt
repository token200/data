Since I couldn't find any information on Li Põld, I'll create a new character inspired by the original story. Here's a summary of Li Põld's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Name:** Li Põld

**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s

**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)

**Weight:** Athletic build, around 140 lbs (64 kg)

**Eye Color:** Deep blue, almost indigo

**Personality:** Li Põld is a brave and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging traditional norms and authority. Her passion for freedom and equality drives her to take risks and push boundaries. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of her way to protect the vulnerable.

**Interests:** Li Põld is an avid reader and enjoys studying ancient history, philosophy, and mythology. She is also a skilled archer and enjoys practicing martial arts. Her love for nature and the outdoors leads her to spend time exploring forests, mountains, and rivers.

**Physical Attributes:** As mentioned earlier, Li Põld stands at 5'8" with an athletic build. Her deep blue eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. She has short, dark hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her features are sharp and angular, giving her a striking appearance.

**Additional Traits:** Li Põld has a scar above her left eyebrow, obtained during a battle with bandits when she was younger. This scar serves as a reminder of her past experiences and fuels her determination to protect others from harm.

Keep in mind that these attributes are fictional and created for the purpose of this response. Feel free to modify or discard them as you see fit!
