Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Li Kovacs:

**Personality:** Li Kovacs is a driven and determined individual, fueled by a strong sense of justice. She has a pragmatic and detached air about her, which helps her navigate the harsh realities of her work as a detective and forensic pathologist. Despite this, she has a deep empathy for those affected by crime and is fiercely committed to making a difference in her community.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing brown eyes
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn straight and shoulder-length

**Interests:** Li Kovacs has a strong interest in forensic science and medicine, which drives her passion for solving crimes. She is meticulous and thorough in her work, always seeking to understand the underlying causes of each case. In addition to her professional interests, she values justice and equality, having grown up in a community that struggles with poverty and inequality.

Outside of work, it's unclear what Li Kovacs' personal interests might be, but it can be inferred that she is someone who prioritizes her duties as a detective and forensic pathologist above all else. She may have few hobbies or leisure activities outside of the demands of her job.

It's worth noting that while Li Kovacs has piercing green eyes in this fictional character summary (which contrasts with the brown eyes mentioned earlier), these two different descriptions seem to create a bit of inconsistency.
