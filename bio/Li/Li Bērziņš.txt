**Interests:** Li Bērziņš is passionate about science, particularly physics and chemistry. He enjoys tinkering with machines, experimenting with new materials, and exploring the properties of light. When not working on scientific endeavors, he can be found reading philosophy texts or attending lectures by prominent thinkers of his time.

**Additional Details:**
