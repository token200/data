Based on the provided short story about Li Jankowska, I have created a new character profile that includes details such as height, eye color, and interests. Here is the summary:

**Physical Attributes:**
Li Jankowska stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, which belies her sharp intellect and intense focus on her work. Her hair is dark brown and often falls in loose waves down her back, framing a heart-shaped face with high cheekbones and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets.

**Personality:**
Li Jankowska is a brilliant and reclusive scientist who exudes an air of quiet confidence and authority. Her intense passion for unlocking the secrets of the universe drives her to push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom, often at great personal cost. Despite this, she possesses a dry sense of humor and can be fiercely loyal to those she trusts. Li's reserved nature has led many to assume that she is aloof or standoffish, but in reality, she is simply intensely focused on her work.

**Interests:**
Li Jankowska's interests are deeply rooted in science, particularly astrophysics and cosmology. She spends most of her free time reading scientific papers, attending lectures, and observing the night sky through a telescope at her private observatory. Li is also an avid pianist and enjoys playing Chopin's nocturnes to clear her mind and stimulate her creative thinking.

In terms of hobbies, Li Jankowska has a fascination with astronomy, particularly the study of black holes and dark matter. She is also a skilled programmer and enjoys coding in her spare time, often using it to simulate complex astrophysical scenarios and test her theories.
