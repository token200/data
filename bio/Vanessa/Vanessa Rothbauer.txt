This suggests that Vanessa is confident, determined, and unafraid to speak her mind.

**Physical Attributes:** Vanessa Rothbauer stands at 5'8" with long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back.

She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** Vanessa Rothbauer is passionate about investigative journalism, with a particular interest in exposing corruption and wrongdoing among the powerful. Outside of work, she enjoys reading history books and watching classic detective films for inspiration.
