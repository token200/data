Here's a summary of Vanessa Ruiz Garcia's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Vanessa is a vibrant and passionate individual with a strong sense of justice. Her fiery personality often gets her into humorous situations, but it also inspires those around her to take action. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for underdogs and strays, which explains why she took in Tortilla, the scrappy little terrier mix who wandered into her bakery.

**Physical Attributes:** Vanessa stands at about 5'6" with an athletic build, honed from years of working in her bakery. Her dark hair is often styled in a messy bun, and her bright hazel eyes sparkle with warmth and wit. She has a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose, which add to her sunny disposition.

**Interests:** Vanessa's passions extend far beyond baking. She loves nothing more than volunteering at local animal shelters and advocating for social justice causes that support underprivileged communities. When she's not in the bakery or working on a new recipe, you can find her hiking in nearby parks or practicing yoga to clear her mind. Her love for animals also led her to become an avid reader of dog behaviorists and trainers, which helps her better understand Tortilla's antics.

Additionally, Vanessa is quite the creative soul, often doodling designs onto concha shells and experimenting with new recipes in her free time. She has a flair for the dramatic, which is reflected in her baked goods â€“ each treat is carefully crafted to evoke a sense of wonder and delight.
