Tomasz Altmann stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and slightly unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a depth of emotion that matches the complexity of his music. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly intense performance.

Tomasz is a creative and introspective person with a passion for sharing emotions through music. He's humble and down-to-earth, despite his international fame and critical acclaim. Tomasz has a strong sense of vulnerability and empathy, which allows him to connect with audiences on a deeper level. He's also fiercely dedicated to his craft, willing to push himself to the limits of human expression to create something truly beautiful.

Tomasz's creative expression extends beyond music as well; he's an avid painter, often using watercolors to capture the fleeting moments of inspiration that strike him during his performances. His art is a reflection of his inner world, with vibrant colors and swirling patterns that evoke the same emotions as his music.
