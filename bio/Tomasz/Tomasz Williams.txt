**Personality:**

Tomasz is a complex individual with a mysterious past and a dry sense of humor. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep love for art and a vulnerable soul that only begins to surface when he's around Sophia. He's fiercely independent and guarded, having grown up on the streets of Warsaw where trust was hard-won. However, as he collaborates with Sophia, he begins to open up about his past struggles and emotions.

**Interests:**

- Art (painting, drawing, sketching)
- Music (classical, jazz, and folk)

- Travel (exploring cities, trying new foods, and immersing himself in different cultures)

Tomasz is passionate about art, which has become his escape from the hardships of his childhood. He's a voracious learner, devouring books on art history, philosophy, and literature to fuel his creativity. When he's not creating art, Tomasz enjoys music and travel, seeking inspiration from the world around him.

As he begins to form a connection with Sophia, Tomasz starts to explore other interests beyond art, including food, architecture, and urban planning. This newfound interest in life's experiences adds depth to his personality and allows him to grow as an individual.
