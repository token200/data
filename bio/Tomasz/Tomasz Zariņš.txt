Based on the provided short story as inspiration, I've created a fictional character profile for Tomasz Zariņš:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of chestnut
* Skin Tone: Pale, with a subtle scattering of freckles across his cheeks and nose

**Personality:**

Tomasz is a quiet and introspective person who prefers to keep to himself. He has a passion for history that drives him to learn as much as he can about the world around him. Despite his reserved nature, Tomasz has a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to uncover hidden secrets.

**Interests:**

* History, particularly the history of Latvia and Eastern Europe
* Researching and studying old manuscripts and photographs
* Genealogy and family research
* Gardening and botany (he has a small garden on his estate where he grows rare flowers and herbs)
* Reading (especially classical literature and historical texts)

**Additional Details:**

Tomasz's love of books and learning is reflected in his workspace at the library, which is filled with stacks of dusty tomes and papers. He often spends hours poring over old manuscripts and photographs, searching for clues about Riga's past.

Despite his love of solitude, Tomasz has a deep sense of loyalty to those he cares about. When Maria invited him to visit her estate, he was hesitant at first, but ultimately accepted the invitation because he knew she was someone special who understood his passions and interests.

In terms of his family history, it's not clear if Tomasz knows much about his parents or where they came from. However, he has always felt a sense of connection to the city of Riga and its rich cultural heritage, which led him to pursue his love of history and research.
