Here's a summary of Tomasz Lewis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tomasz is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He exudes an air of calmness and authority, which commands attention and respect. As a retired detective, he has honed his skills to become one of the most skilled investigators in Warsaw, Poland. Despite his reputation, Tomasz remains humble and unassuming, often underestimating others due to his reserved nature.

However, as the story progresses, it's clear that Tomasz is driven by his insatiable curiosity and determination. He is fiercely intelligent and refuses to accept anything at face value, even when faced with inconsistencies in witnesses' testimonies or surprising twists in the case. His confidence grows with each new discovery, but he also remains humble and open-minded, willing to re-examine evidence with fresh eyes.

**Physical Attributes:** Tomasz Lewis is a tall, imposing figure. He stands at 6 feet (183 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of physical activity and mental discipline. His dark hair is graying at the temples, adding a touch of maturity to his features. His piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential deception.

Tomasz's style is understated yet elegant. He favors classic, timeless clothing in muted colors that allow him to blend into the background while still exuding an air of sophistication.

**Interests:** As a retired detective, Tomasz has spent years honing his skills in observation, deduction, and analysis. His interests lie in the fields of criminology, forensic science, and psychology, which he pursued during his time as a detective. He is particularly fascinated by human behavior and the intricacies of the human mind.

Outside of his work, Tomasz enjoys relaxing in peaceful environments, such as the small town of Gda≈Ñsk where he now resides. He finds solace in the stunning views of the Baltic coast and the calming atmosphere that comes with it. His tranquil existence is disrupted only by the occasional case that requires his expertise, which always keeps him engaged and stimulated.

Despite his calm exterior, Tomasz has a dry sense of humor and enjoys observing human behavior, often with a wry smile or raised eyebrow. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly Anna Nowak, who unknowingly led him on a wild goose chase in the case.
