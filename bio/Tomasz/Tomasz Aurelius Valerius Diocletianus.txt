Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Tomasz Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Personality:** Tomasz is a complex and brooding individual with a strong sense of resolve. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to carry emotional burdens due to his troubled past. Despite this, he has a deep-seated desire for connection and adventure, which drives him to keep moving forward. Tomasz is also intensely introspective and haunted by the expectations of others, particularly those associated with his full name.

**Physical Attributes:** Tomasz stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a ruggedly handsome face and piercing blue-green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His hair is a dark brown color that falls to his shoulders in loose waves. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many battles.

**Interests:** Tomasz's past experiences have shaped him into a skilled warrior and tactician, but he no longer finds fulfillment in the military or politics that once defined his life. Instead, he is drawn to the freedom and adventure of the open desert landscape, where he can walk alone and unencumbered. He has a deep appreciation for ancient history and culture, particularly Roman and Eastern traditions, which he learned during his early years as a warrior.

In his current state of drift, Tomasz finds solace in simple activities like walking, exploring, and engaging in conversation with fellow travelers. Despite his tough exterior, he is deeply curious about the world around him and is always on the lookout for new experiences and connections that might help him rediscover his purpose.
