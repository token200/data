Her athletic build is honed from years of rigorous training and competition, earning her a reputation as one of the most formidable players in the women's game.

**Interests:** Ismail is passionate about tennis, of course, but she's also an avid traveler and loves exploring new cultures.

When under pressure or feeling stressed, Ismail tends to tap her pen impatiently against the clipboard, a habit that drove her coaches crazy but also helped her focus.
