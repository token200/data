**Interests:**
Ismail's interests are largely centered around his work as a con artist. He enjoys the thrill of the game, outsmarting others and staying one step ahead of those who try to catch him.

As for his connection to philanthropy, Ismail sees it as a means to an end – a way to use his skills to help people while also advancing his own career. However, as he gets closer to Sophia and the charity she works for, he starts to question whether his motives are entirely pure.
