Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Aurélie Németh:

**Personality:** Aurélie is a creative and introspective person who has experienced significant loss in her life. She is deeply emotional and sensitive, often struggling to find inspiration in her art after the passing of her husband, Pierre. Despite this, she is resilient and determined, willing to confront her grief head-on and find solace in her craft.

**Physical Attributes:** Aurélie stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a deep, expressive brown that seem to hold a wealth of emotions within them. Her hair is dark brown and falls in loose waves down her back. She often dresses in simple, elegant clothing that allows her full range of movement, as she is always on the go between her studio and various art supplies.

**Interests:** Aurélie's primary interest is painting, which has been a vital part of her life since childhood. She finds solace and inspiration in the process of creating art, using color and texture to convey emotions and tell stories. Her other interests include literature (she is particularly fond of French poetry), nature (she spends hours walking along the Seine River near her studio), and philosophy (she often reads about existentialism and phenomenology). Despite struggling with grief, she has also recently developed a passion for photography, using it as a means to capture the fleeting moments of life.

**Other traits:** Aurélie is fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. She can come across as introverted or aloof to those who don't know her, but once you get to know her, she reveals a warm and compassionate side. Her creative process is deeply intuitive, often guided by emotions rather than logical reasoning. As she navigates her grief, Aurélie is constantly seeking new ways to channel her emotions into meaningful work that brings her joy and fulfillment.

**Quirks:** Aurélie has a habit of muttering French phrases to herself when she's lost in thought or feeling anxious. She also tends to get lost in daydreams while working on her art, often forgetting about time altogether. When painting, she will sometimes hum melodies that echo the rhythms and harmonies found in music from her childhood.

Overall, Aurélie is a complex and multifaceted person whose artistic journey reflects both her inner struggles and creative triumphs.
