Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aurélie Nachtnebel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Aurélie appears to be a creative and introspective person who values connection and community. She seems to be comfortable with herself and others, as evidenced by her easy smile when Luna joins her at the café. Her thoughts wander back to her art project, suggesting that she is passionate about artistic expression and willing to explore new ideas. The text also suggests that Aurélie is reflective, able to calm herself in a stressful situation (washing away stress with the background noise of conversation) and aware of her own emotional state ("the comfort wash over [her]").

Physical Attributes: 
- Height: 5'6" (168 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark Brown

Interests:
- Art (specifically, charcoal sketches exploring reality and fantasy)
- Creative Expression
- Abstract Expressionism (a style of art characterized by spontaneous and expressive brushstrokes)

Based on the story's description of her thoughts while sitting at a café, it can be inferred that Aurélie is likely an introverted person. However, when she engages with Luna, her friend, she seems more outgoing.

Given the brief nature of the passage, it's challenging to pinpoint all aspects of Aurélie's personality and interests.
