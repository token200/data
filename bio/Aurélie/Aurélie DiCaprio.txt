Here is a rewritten summary with the details fictionalized and inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio:

Aurélie is an American environmentalist and actor born on November 11th in New Orleans, Louisiana. She stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing green eyes that seem to sparkle with passion for the causes she advocates for.

Growing up surrounded by the arts, Aurélie was encouraged by her mother, a renowned photographer, and her father, a musician who played the guitar in various bands. Her family's love for creativity and self-expression nurtured her interest in acting from a young age. She began performing in school plays and local theater productions before landing her first role at 13 on the TV series "Bayou Nights".

As she grew older, Aurélie took on more significant roles in Hollywood films such as "The Wildheart", "River's Edge", and "Echoes of the Past". Her performances earned her critical acclaim and numerous award nominations. She is particularly known for her portrayal of strong-willed characters who fight against injustice.

When not acting, Aurélie is an avid environmentalist. She has traveled extensively to study different ecosystems and raise awareness about conservation efforts. In 2006, she founded the "Green Odyssey" project, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions in local communities through innovative solutions. Her dedication to this cause earned her recognition from various environmental organizations.

Years later, Aurélie's tireless work paid off when she won the prestigious "Golden Leaf" award for Best Environmentalist of the Year (2015). The honor was given in recognition of her outstanding contributions to raising awareness about climate change and promoting sustainable practices.
