**Physical Attributes:** Harley Petrovich stands at around 5'10" with an athletic build, suggesting he is physically fit from his active lifestyle as a private investigator. His hair is likely dark brown or black, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he interrogates. He has a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, hinting at a troubled past.

**Personality:** Harley Petrovich is known for his quick wit and sharp tongue, often using his sarcasm to disarm suspects and get them to open up. He is confident in his abilities as a private investigator, never hesitating to take on cases that others deem too difficult or complicated. Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and an underlying sense of justice that drives him to solve each case.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Harley Petrovich has a keen interest in uncovering the truth and exposing those who try to hide it. He is fiercely intelligent and loves nothing more than piecing together seemingly unrelated clues to solve a case. In his free time, he enjoys smoking cigarettes (despite the dismay of his secretary), likely as a way to relax and unwind after a long day of investigating.

Overall, Harley Petrovich appears to be a rugged, confident, and intelligent individual with a dry sense of humor and an unwavering commitment to justice.
