However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep sense of vulnerability and empathy, which she developed growing up on the streets.

In addition to these interests, Harley is also drawn to music, particularly the sounds of punk rock and indie folk, which resonate with her own rebellious spirit and desire for self-expression. She enjoys reading books on philosophy and psychology, seeking to understand herself and others better, and practicing yoga and meditation to find balance in a chaotic world.

As she begins to question her own identity and purpose, Harley discovers a new interest in spirituality and personal growth, seeking to explore the depths of human connection and meaning. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she navigates the complexities of her own heart and soul.
