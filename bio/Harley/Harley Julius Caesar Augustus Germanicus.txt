His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if searching for hidden truths or weaknesses. His dark hair is always neatly trimmed, revealing a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones that give him an air of authority.

**Interests:** Harley's primary interests lie in the mystical arts and the study of ancient magic. He is particularly drawn to the works of Augustus Caesar and seeks to emulate his wisdom and leadership qualities. When not fighting or studying, Harley enjoys meditating, practicing martial arts, and engaging in strategic planning with his allies.

**Additional Details:** Harley's family background suggests a strong connection to Roman heritage, but he also has Germanic ancestry through his mentor, Germanicus. This blend of influences shapes his unique approach to magic and warfare, combining the discipline of ancient Rome with the fierce warrior traditions of his Germanic forebears.
