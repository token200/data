Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Harley Bergstrom:

**Personality:** Harley Bergstrom is known for her fiery personality and sharp wit, which allows her to cut through even the most complex web of deceit. She is fearless, driven by a strong sense of justice, and has an unrelenting determination to uncover the truth. Her sharp mind and quick thinking have made her a formidable investigative journalist.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a piercing intensity that seems to bore into those she interviews.
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a short, edgy pixie cut that adds to her confident and assertive demeanor.

**Interests:** As an investigative journalist, Harley has a natural curiosity about the world around her. She is fascinated by the intricate web of power structures and corruption that exist beneath the surface of society. Her interests include:

* Investigative journalism
* Politics and government
* Corruption and scandal
* True crime and history
* Reading (she's particularly fond of philosophy, psychology, and sociology)
* Exercise and staying physically fit (as a busy journalist, she needs to maintain her energy levels)

As an added detail, I'll suggest that Harley has a habit of collecting rare and obscure books on history and philosophy, which reflects her intellectual curiosity and passion for learning. She's also been known to indulge in the occasional glass of wine after a long day of writing, as a way to unwind and recharge for the next investigative challenge.
