Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Harley Lafourcade:

**Personality:** Harley appears to be a free-spirited individual with a complex and introspective nature. She has a tendency to carry emotional weight, as evident from her relief in taking deep breaths after stepping off the bus and feeling the cool desert air envelop her. Her husky voice and cigarette smoke-tinged demeanor suggest a certain level of weariness and possibly a rebellious streak. However, she is also shown to be introspective and contemplative, lost in thought as she gazes out into the darkness.

**Physical Attributes:** Harley's physical appearance remains largely unexplored in the provided text, but we can make some educated guesses based on her age, height, and eye color. She likely has a lean or athletic build, given that she is described as sliding onto a stool without any hesitation. Her height appears to be average to below-average, as there are no explicit mentions of her standing out in terms of size. Her eye color is not mentioned explicitly, but the blue-eyed stranger who catches her attention suggests that she may have similar or contrasting eye colors.

**Interests:** Based on her interactions with the blue-eyed stranger and her own introspection, it can be inferred that Harley has a strong interest in exploring her past and rekindling old relationships. Her attraction to the stranger is not just physical but also emotional, suggesting that she values deep connections and possibly intimacy. Additionally, her affinity for whiskey and cigarettes implies that she may have a taste for adventure and a more reckless lifestyle.

**Additional Details:** Given Harley's background as someone who lost touch with her confidant and first love in college, it is likely that she has a strong emotional attachment to the past and an inclination towards nostalgia. Her willingness to engage in long conversations with strangers also suggests that she values connection and communication over material comforts or superficial relationships.

Overall, Harley Lafourcade seems like a complex and enigmatic individual, driven by her emotions, desires, and curiosity.
