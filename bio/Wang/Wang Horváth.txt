Based on the inspiration provided by the prompt, here's a summary of the fictional character Wang Horváth:

**Physical Attributes:** Wang Horváth stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic build. His eyes are a bright shade of indigo, which seems almost impossible for his Hungarian heritage to be true. He has short, dark brown hair that is often styled in a messy, piecey manner.

**Personality:** Wang Horváth is a complex and introspective individual. As the illegitimate son of a Hungarian aristocrat and an unknown mother from Eastern Europe, he has always struggled with his identity and sense of belonging. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them. His sharp intellect and strategic thinking make him an excellent problem solver, but also lead him to be somewhat detached from others.

**Background:** Born in Budapest, Hungary, Wang Horváth grew up moving between different countries and living in a state of limbo due to his illegitimate status. He is well-educated and highly intelligent, with a passion for engineering and physics. He has spent years working as an engineer and inventor, but has recently turned his attention to art, where he finds solace from the world's scrutiny.

**Interests:** Wang Horváth is deeply passionate about painting and sketching, often finding inspiration in the intricate patterns of nature. He also enjoys playing chess and reading classical literature, with a particular fondness for the works of Kafka and Dostoevsky. Despite his reserved personality, he has a playful sense of humor and loves to tell bad jokes and make people laugh.
