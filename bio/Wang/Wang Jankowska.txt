Based on the inspiration from Wang Jianna's story, I've created a fictional character profile for Wang Jankowska:

**Physical Attributes:**
Wang Jankowska stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an piercing emerald green, almond-shaped and fringed with thick lashes. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, a testament to her mixed heritage.

**Personality:**
Wang Jankowska is a free-spirited and adventurous individual, always chasing the next thrill and mystery. She possesses an innate curiosity that drives her to uncover hidden truths and secrets. Despite her bold nature, she has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect those she cares about.

**Interests:**
Wang Jankowska is passionate about exploring ancient mysteries, folklore, and mythology. She's fascinated by the intersection of science and spirituality, often finding herself drawn to unconventional explanations for seemingly inexplicable events. When not working on a case or investigating new leads, Wang Jankowska can be found practicing martial arts, playing the violin, or reading philosophy texts.

**Additional Details:**
Wang Jankowska's full name means "clear river" in Polish, a nod to her Eastern European heritage. She has a small tattoo of a Celtic knot on her left wrist and often wears layered clothing with intricate patterns that reflect her eclectic style.

I hope this character profile captures the essence of a fictional Wang Jankowska!
