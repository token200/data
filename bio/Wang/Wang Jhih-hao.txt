Based on the short story, here is a summary of Wang Jhih-hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Wang Jhih-hao stands at 6'1" with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost purple in hue, which seem to bore into those he looks at. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his chiseled features. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, suggesting a life of adventure and danger.

**Personality:** Jhih-hao's past shrouded in mystery has left him with a complex personality. On the surface, he appears to be a master thief, a charmer, and a man with a heart of stone. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deeply wounded soul. He is haunted by his past, driven by memories of loss and pain. Despite this, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and empathy, particularly when it comes to those around him, like Lin. As he opens up to her, his guard drops, revealing a sensitive and caring individual who yearns for connection and redemption.

**Interests:** Wang Jhih-hao's life revolves around the city, its rhythms, and its secrets. He is drawn to the urban landscape like a magnet, navigating its streets with ease and fluidity. His interests include:

* Mastering the art of stealth and deception
* Exploring the city's hidden corners and alleys
* Collecting rare artifacts and treasures
* Learning new skills and trades (e.g., pickpocketing, lock-picking)
* Hiding in plain sight, observing human behavior

However, after meeting Lin, Jhih-hao's interests shift towards:

* Painting and art (inspired by Lin's creative energy)
* Exploring the emotional depths of his past
* Finding a way to leave his dark past behind
* Nurturing a new sense of hope and redemption
