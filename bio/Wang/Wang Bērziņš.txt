Based on the short story, I have created a fictional character profile for Wang Bērziņš:

His hair is dark brown, often tied back in a ponytail, revealing his piercing emerald green eyes that seem to sparkle with determination.

His strong sense of justice and conviction drive him to take bold action, even if it means putting himself in harm's way. Despite his bravery, Wang Bērziņš has a compassionate side, showing empathy and kindness to those who have been affected by the darkness.

**Interests:**

In quieter moments, Wang Bērziņš enjoys studying ancient texts and learning about the history of Azura's mystical forces. His love for his homeland drives him to continue fighting for its freedom and prosperity.

**Additional Details:**
