Here's a summary of Lucien Wo≈∫niak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, textured manner
- Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at

**Personality:**
Lucien is a brooding and introspective individual with a complex past. He's fiercely independent and has a deep sense of loyalty, which can sometimes make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. As a former spy, Lucien has learned to navigate the shadows and trust his instincts, but he's also haunted by demons from his past that still linger in the present.

**Interests:**
Lucien's interests are centered around his work and personal relationships, though his line of work often leaves little time for leisure activities. When not working, Lucien enjoys:

- Cigarettes and whiskey (he has a fondness for fine scotch)
- Long walks along the Seine or other Parisian thoroughfares
- Classic literature (he's particularly drawn to French authors like Baudelaire and Proust)
- Music: Lucien is an avid fan of jazz and blues, often seeking out underground clubs in the city where he can lose himself in the rhythms.

Despite his tough exterior, Lucien has a deep emotional wellspring that he only occasionally reveals. He's driven by a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to uncover the truth about his past, even if it means putting himself in harm's way once again.
