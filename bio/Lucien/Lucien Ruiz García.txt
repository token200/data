Here is a summary of Lucien Ruiz García's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lucien is a complex individual with a mysterious past. He appears reserved and introverted, preferring to keep to himself and maintain a low profile. Despite this, he has a deep sense of connection to those around him, particularly when it comes to Aurore. He is guarded and cautious, having been burned by his past experiences as a member of "The Order." However, as he opens up to Aurore, his personality reveals itself to be thoughtful, introspective, and even vulnerable.

**Physical Attributes:** Lucien stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His eyes are a striking indigo color that seem to hold secrets, adding to his enigmatic persona. His hair is dark and neatly trimmed, often falling across his forehead in a way that hints at a deeper intensity beneath the surface.

**Interests:** Lucien's primary interests revolve around bookselling and collecting rare volumes. He finds solace in the quiet, calming atmosphere of his bookstore, surrounded by dusty tomes and the soothing sound of the Mediterranean waves. Despite his love for literature, he is also drawn to music – particularly classical compositions that evoke a sense of melancholy and longing.

As Lucien navigates his complex past with Aurore, it becomes clear that he is slowly shedding his cloak of secrecy and embracing a new sense of purpose. With her by his side, he begins to explore the possibility of leaving "The Order" behind and forging a new path in life.
