Here is a summary of Lucien Martin's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lucien is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a deep sense of vulnerability and a longing for redemption. As he navigates his personal and professional life, Lucien struggles with the weight of his own failures and the moral compromises he's made in pursuit of success.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown

**Interests:** Lucien is a man of few passions, but those he does have are deeply rooted in his work as a private investigator. He is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged. Outside of work, Lucien has no discernible hobbies or interests, except perhaps reading about history and philosophy. He is also an avid observer of human behavior and is drawn to understanding the motivations and desires of those around him.

Despite his tough exterior, Lucien has a deep sense of empathy and is capable of forming strong connections with others, particularly those who share similar experiences of loss or trauma. His encounter with Colette at the bar sets off a chain reaction that challenges his entire worldview and forces him to confront the darkness he's been running from for so long.

Overall, Lucien Martin is a richly nuanced character with a complex mix of strengths and weaknesses, driven by both a desire for redemption and a thirst for truth.
