Here's a summary of Lucien Hiroki's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the given short story:

**Personality:** Lucien is introspective and emotionally guarded. He struggles with opening up to people, especially after receiving devastating news about his sister's health. However, when he meets Emiko, he finds himself drawn to her presence and feels a sense of ease around her. This suggests that he may be more open and vulnerable than he initially appears, and that he values deep connections with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Lucien is not described in great detail, but we can infer some characteristics from the story:

* Age: It's difficult to determine Lucien's age, but based on his emotional maturity and life experience, it's likely that he's an adult in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s.
* Height: There is no mention of Lucien's height, but based on the narrative, it's possible that he's average to slightly above-average height.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, there is no information about Lucien's eye color in the story.

**Interests:** Based on his behavior and interactions with Emiko, we can infer some aspects of Lucien's interests:

* Art: Lucien notices Emiko sketching and becomes captivated by her creative process. This suggests that he may appreciate art or have an interest in creative activities.
* Music or atmosphere: The fact that Lucien is drawn to the dimly lit caf√© setting, with its rain-soaked window, implies that he values cozy and intimate environments. He may also enjoy music or atmosphere that evokes a sense of calmness or melancholy.

It's worth noting that these inferences are based on a limited sample of information and should be taken as speculative rather than definitive conclusions about Lucien Hiroki's personality, physical attributes, and interests.
