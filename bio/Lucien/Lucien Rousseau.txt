He has a strong sense of conviction and is not afraid to take risks in pursuit of knowledge.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Hazel, with a golden undertone that seems to sparkle when he's excited about something.
* Hair: Dark brown, cut short, and often windswept due to his outdoor adventures.
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a wiry physique honed from years of rock climbing and hiking.

**Interests:** Geology is Lucien's greatest passion, and he spends most of his time studying the Earth's history and uncovering hidden secrets beneath the surface. He is fascinated by the intricate patterns and processes that shape our planet, and he has a deep respect for the natural world. When not in the field, Lucien enjoys reading about science, philosophy, and history, and he is always on the lookout for new books or articles to expand his knowledge.
