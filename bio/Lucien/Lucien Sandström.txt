Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Lucien Sandström:

**Personality:** Lucien appears to be a thoughtful and introspective individual, with a passion for learning and discovery. He is driven by a desire to understand his own past and connect with others across different realms. Despite struggling to find purpose after university, he found solace in the world of books and eventually discovered his own unique abilities through "Memoriae". His personality suggests that Lucien is curious, empathetic, and open-minded.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel with a warm golden brown hue
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly to reveal his forehead and temples
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent cheekbones, and an expression that hints at quiet contemplation

**Interests:** 

- Books and Literature: Lucien's love for books is evident from the moment he enters Mrs. Jenkins' bookstore. He has a keen eye for rare and obscure volumes, and his connection to "Memoriae" suggests a deep interest in ancient knowledge and mystical practices.
- Mysticism and Spirituality: The visions and echoes Lucien experiences through "Memoriae" reveal his fascination with the mysteries of life, death, and the interconnectedness of all things. His great-grandfather's journal and Magnus Sandström's legacy fuel this curiosity.
- Historical Research: Lucien's exploration of his family history and the book's secrets indicate a strong desire to learn from the past and understand the present in terms of its connections to previous eras.
- Personal Growth and Self-Discovery: As he navigates his newfound abilities, Lucien strives to deepen his understanding of himself and the world around him. This quest for self-knowledge underscores the importance of introspection and exploration in his life.

**Missing Details:** To further flesh out Lucien's character:

* Age: Late 20s or early 30s, given that he left university and found purpose through "Memoriae".
* Education Background: Before entering Mrs. Jenkins' bookstore, Lucien may have pursued various studies, including history, literature, or philosophy.
* Skills: Beyond his intuitive abilities with "Memoriae", Lucien's skills might lie in linguistics, historical research, or empathy-based counseling, reflecting his interests and the values instilled by Mrs. Jenkins.
