Here is a summary of Lucien Angert's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:**

Lucien appears to be a determined and driven individual, willing to put in long hours to solve a case. He is also introspective and haunted by his past, as evident from his emotional response to the murder victims' stories of fear and vulnerability. Despite this, he is not one to shy away from challenges and is willing to face difficult situations alone.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Lucien's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on the description of him standing at the edge of a cliff, it can be inferred that he is tall and likely an imposing figure.
* Eye Color: The story does not mention Lucien's eye color, so I will assume it to be brown or hazel, which are common eye colors for detectives.

**Interests:**

It appears that Lucien has a strong interest in solving mysteries and crimes, particularly those that involve the vulnerable members of society. He is deeply invested in his work as a detective with the NYPD and is willing to put in extra effort to bring justice to his victims' families.

Additionally, it seems that Lucien values his independence and autonomy, as he hesitates to answer his boss's call initially and prefers to face challenges alone rather than seeking support from others. This may indicate a personality trait of introversion or self-reliance.
