Despite this, he has a childlike curiosity and sense of wonder, evident in his enthusiasm for exploring the past and learning about historical events.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost electric in intensity
* Hair: Dark brown, often disheveled and sticking out in every direction, as if he has been touching his head with his hands too many times.
* Build: Slightly slender, but strong from years of working on complex machinery.
* Distinguishing feature: A small scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which he obtained during an accident in his laboratory.

**Interests:** Evgeniy is obsessed with understanding the mysteries of time travel and has spent years studying theoretical physics and historical events.

**Habits:** Evgeniy has a tendency to get lost in thought, often zoning out while working on complex problems. He is also prone to making mistakes, as evidenced by the "steampunk nightmare" of his time machine, Chrono.

**Quirks:** Evgeniy has a habit of muttering to himself when working on particularly tricky problems, often saying phrases like "What if?" or "Why not?". He also has a fondness for antique clocks and other time-keeping devices, which he displays proudly in his laboratory.
