I can help you with a summary of the fictional character Evgeniy KissEva Askarova. Since I don't have any information from the provided short story, I'll create a fictional profile for her.

**Name:** Evgeniy KissEva Askarova (However, it seems more fitting to use one name as "Evgeniya" is a traditional Russian feminine given name and 'KissEva' seems out of place; let's settle on 'Evgeniya', with the surname modified to something Russian, e.g., 'Askarov').
