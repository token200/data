Based on the publicly available information about Arianna Huffington's contemporary and business partner, Michael Harris had a brief association with a Russian journalist named Evgeniy Netrushevskiy. However, it was not this individual I found most relevant when researching for details regarding  Evgeny who is more commonly referred to as Ariana Huffington (not the name provided in your prompt) but is known by a man associated with Thrive Global as simply "Evgeny". The man whose name matches that provided has not been a topic of popular culture or media coverage.
