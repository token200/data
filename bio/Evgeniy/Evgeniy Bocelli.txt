Based on the inspiration provided, I've created a new character profile for Evgeniy Bocelli:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: An unsettling shade of grey, almost purplish undertones
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt
- Skin: Pale with a subtle sheen, hinting at an otherworldly presence
- Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique

**Personality:**
Evgeniy Bocelli is enigmatic and charismatic, exuding an aura of mystery that draws people in. He possesses an unsettling charm, making others feel seen and understood, but also vulnerable to his manipulation. His gaze is piercing, capable of cutting through defenses and revealing deepest fears and desires. Despite this, he appears harmless, with a warm smile that can be disarming.

**Interests:**
Evgeniy's interests are centered around the ancient art of "zhizn'-vor" (life-taking), which he practices with an uncanny precision. He studies the human psyche, searching for weaknesses to exploit and desires to manipulate. His fascination with the darker aspects of human nature drives him to delve deeper into the shadows, where his powers grow stronger.

Additionally, Evgeniy is drawn to the beauty of the snow-capped mountains, finding solace in their solitude and vastness. He often spends hours gazing up at the stars, lost in thought, as if seeking guidance from the unknown.

Evgeniy's connection to nature and the mystical forces that govern it is evident in his respect for the land and its secrets. He has a deep understanding of the natural world, which he uses to fuel his powers and navigate the complexities of human psychology.
