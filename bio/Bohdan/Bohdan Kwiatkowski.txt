**Physical Attributes:**
Bohdan Kwiatkowski is a tall and slender individual, standing at 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) with an athletic build. His eye color is a deep shade of brown that seems to sparkle with curiosity. He has short, dark hair often styled in a messy, tousled manner, which complements his rugged yet refined features.

**Personality:**

As a self-taught taxidermy expert, he has developed a unique approach to his craft that blends creativity with precision. He is confident in his abilities but remains open to feedback and new ideas, which makes him relatable and endearing to those around him. Bohdan's passion for art and science drives him to innovate and push boundaries, often leading to lively debates and discussions about the intersection of these two disciplines.

**Interests:**
Bohdan is deeply passionate about taxidermy, which has become an integral part of his artistic expression. He finds joy in combining seemingly disparate elements to create striking and thought-provoking arrangements. When not working on new projects, Bohdan enjoys spending time outdoors, exploring the natural world, and engaging with animals. His love for tracking and hunting (which he inherited from his father) has taught him valuable skills that complement his artistic pursuits. Additionally, Bohdan is an avid collector of vinyl records, which often finds its way into his taxidermy creations as a creative element.

**Additional Insights:**
Bohdan's fascination with the intersection of art and science stems from his childhood experiences growing up in rural Poland, surrounded by animals and the natural world. His father's stories about hunting and preserving specimens sparked an interest that eventually led him to develop his own unique approach to taxidermy. As he continued to hone his craft, Bohdan became increasingly drawn to the creative possibilities offered by this ancient art form.
