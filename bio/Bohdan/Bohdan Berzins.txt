**Personality:** Bohdan is a charismatic and passionate individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He has a raw energy and unapologetic stage presence that commands attention, but he also has a soft spot for strays - both human and animal. Despite his tough exterior, Bohdan is vulnerable and emotionally expressive.

**Physical Attributes:** Bohdan stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, which suggests a strong foundation for his energetic stage presence. His eyes are a bright blue, piercing and intense, reflecting his creative intensity. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his edgy reputation.

**Interests:** Bohdan has two main passions in life: music (specifically, alternative rock) and art. He finds inspiration in both mediums, but they seem to be pulling him in different directions at the moment. He loves attending local art openings and engaging with artists and curators, where he can showcase his eclectic taste and charm. Bohdan is also deeply committed to Electric Storm, the band he founded, although it's clear that his priorities are shifting.

Bohdan's fascination with strays - both human and animal - suggests a compassionate and empathetic side to his personality, which might be at odds with his tough exterior. His love of art and music, however, is undeniably infectious and creative.
