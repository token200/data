Despite his difficulties, Peter is determined to find solace and healing, particularly when it comes to remembering the happier times with Emily.

**Interests:** Peter's interests appear to be centered around his work as a librarian and sailing. He is deeply passionate about books and literature, and spends many hours surrounded by dusty tomes in his small office. Sailing is also a significant interest of his, particularly when he can do it with Emily by his side (even if her presence is more imaginary than real).
