Based on the story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Peter Kalniņa:

**Personality:** Peter Kalniņa seems to be a driven and determined individual who faces pressure and expectations from being a national hero. However, he also has a moment of relief and enjoyment when he's able to forget about his struggles and just focus on the game. This suggests that he may have a strong sense of resilience and determination, as well as the ability to manage stress and maintain a positive mindset.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the story about Peter Kalniņa's physical attributes, including height and eye color. However, based on his athletic abilities and skills as a hockey player, it can be inferred that he has quick reflexes, agility, and strength.

**Interests:** As a skilled hockey player, Peter Kalniņa is likely passionate about the sport of ice hockey and enjoys competing at a high level. The story also suggests that he values winning and achieving success, but this may not necessarily mean that he is driven by personal ambition or material gain. Instead, his interest in the game seems to be rooted in his love for competition and the thrill of playing with others.
