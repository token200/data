Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Peter Krūmiņš's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Peter is an introspective and artistic individual who appreciates the beauty of the past. He has a keen eye for detail and a passion for photography that drives him to capture the essence of Riga's Old Town. He seems to be humble and down-to-earth, as evident from his willingness to listen and learn from the shopkeeper about her grandfather's camera.

**Physical Attributes:** Peter is likely a slender or average-built individual, given the description of him "wandering through the cobblestone streets" without mentioning any notable physical strength. However, this could also be an assumption, and we don't have enough information to confirm his physique.

His height remains unknown, but we can estimate it based on the story. As Peter navigates narrow alleys and shops with ease, he likely has a somewhat compact build that allows him to fit comfortably in tight spaces.

Eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but assuming a typical Eastern European (Latvian) eye color profile, we could imagine Peter having brown or blue eyes.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, photography is Peter's primary passion. He is fascinated by the beauty of Riga's Old Town and spends most of his days capturing its architecture and history through his camera lens.

In addition to photography, it can be inferred that Peter values art, history, and antiques. His fascination with the antique camera in the shop suggests he has a deep appreciation for artifacts from the past.

Peter's connection to his town and community is also evident, as he becomes known as the "town's resident photographer." He takes pride in capturing memories and moments that showcase Riga's rich history and beauty.
