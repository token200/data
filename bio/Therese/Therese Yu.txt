Here's a summary of Therese Yu's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Therese is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her expressive eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to hold a world of emotion within them. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of practicing yoga and other forms of physical exercise.

**Personality:**
Therese is a complex and introverted individual with a sharp wit and quick tongue. Despite her confident exterior, she struggles with self-doubt and anxiety, particularly in the face of criticism or rejection. However, when it comes to her art, Therese is unapologetically passionate and determined, willing to take risks and push boundaries to express herself authentically.

**Interests:**
Therese is a talented artist with a deep love for painting, drawing, and mixed media techniques. She is particularly drawn to abstract expressionism and the exploration of themes related to identity, culture, and social justice. When not creating art, Therese enjoys practicing yoga, reading philosophical and literary works, and experimenting with new recipes in her small kitchen. She is also an avid listener, often finding inspiration in the stories and experiences of others.

**Additional Details:**
Therese grew up in a multicultural family that encouraged her creativity from a young age. She spent much of her childhood exploring the city's street art scene and attending concerts, festivals, and other cultural events. As she grew older, Therese became increasingly interested in exploring the intersections between identity, politics, and art, which would eventually become the subject matter of her own work.

Despite her passion for art, Therese is not a fan of social media or the art world's superficial aspects. She prefers to focus on creating meaningful connections with others through her art, rather than seeking likes, followers, or fame.
