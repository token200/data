Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Therese Cooper:

**Personality:** Therese is known for her striking green eyes and fiery personality. As a detective with the city police department, she has a reputation for being fearless and unapologetic. She is confident in her instincts and isn't afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. Her colleagues respect her tenacity and willingness to take risks.

**Physical Attributes:** Therese is of average height, standing at around 5'8" (173 cm). Her striking green eyes are a distinctive feature, and they seem to gleam with intensity when she's focused on a case. She has short, dark hair that frames her heart-shaped face. Her sharp jawline and angular features give her a strong, determined look.

**Interests:** Therese is passionate about solving complex cases and uncovering the truth. She has a keen analytical mind and enjoys pouring over evidence and following leads. Outside of work, she likely values independence, intelligence, and physical activity (given her height and build). Her love for justice and desire to see wrongdoers brought to account suggest that she's also fiercely loyal to those she cares about.

It's worth noting that some details from the short story are not explicitly stated, so I've used my best judgment to fill in any gaps. For example, it's not clear what Therese's personal life is like or whether she has any family or close relationships outside of work. However, based on her personality and skills as a detective, it seems likely that she values independence and self-sufficiency.
