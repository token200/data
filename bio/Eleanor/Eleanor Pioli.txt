Eleanor is a petite woman, standing at approximately 5'2" (157 cm) tall. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, bright blue that seem to sparkle with creativity whenever she's engaged in art. She has a slender build and often wears comfortable, flowing clothing that allows her to move freely.

Eleanor is a quiet and reserved person who has always felt like an outsider among her peers. However, behind her introverted exterior lies a passionate and creative soul. She is determined and driven, willing to take risks and challenge the status quo in order to pursue her dreams. Eleanor is also fiercely loyal to those she cares about, particularly her best friend Rachel, whom she met at La Bohème.

**Interests:**
Eleanor's primary passion is art, specifically painting and drawing. She finds solace and inspiration in the world of color and texture, and spends hours sketching and experimenting with different techniques. Her parents encouraged her creativity from a young age, providing her with access to art supplies and fostering her love of art.

She is drawn to the experimental and avant-garde aspects of art, enjoying the process of pushing boundaries and challenging herself creatively. With Francoise and the gang at La Bohème by her side, Eleanor feels a sense of belonging and community that she has never experienced before, and she knows that this is where she is meant to be.
