Here's a summary of Eleanor Ros√©n's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Eleanor is a introspective and creative person who follows her heart. She's been known to be impulsive and emotional, as evident from her decision to leave her small village in Sweden without fully thinking through the consequences. Despite this, she's also shown to be brave and willing to take risks, as seen in her willingness to explore a new city on her own. Her personality is likely influenced by her desire for independence and self-discovery.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown
* Hair Color: Dark blonde
* Skin Tone: Fair with a hint of Scandinavian undertones

These physical attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on Eleanor's description as having "grey London air" and being from Sweden, I've made some educated guesses about her appearance.

**Interests:** Eleanor is an avid reader and writer. She has a passion for literature and is drawn to books that explore complex themes and emotions. Her love of words and stories likely stems from her desire for self-expression and connection with others through writing. In the context of the story, she's also interested in exploring new places and experiencing different cultures, which is evident from her wanderings through the city.

Additionally, Eleanor appears to be fascinated by the concept of identity and how it relates to one's past, present, and future. Her conversation with Alice in the bookstore suggests that she's grappling with questions about who she truly is and where she belongs.
