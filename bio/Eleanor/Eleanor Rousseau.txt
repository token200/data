Here is a summary of Eleanor Rousseau's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eleanor is a passionate and determined individual with a strong love for restoration and preservation. She is driven by a sense of pride and satisfaction when she brings an old car back to its former glory. Her friends and family may have thought her obsession was "mad," but Eleanor's dedication and perseverance ultimately led to success.

**Physical Attributes:** Eleanor is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with a slender build and a strong presence. She has long, curly brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a bright blue, reminiscent of the French sky on a clear summer day. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.

**Interests:** Eleanor's primary interest is restoring and preserving classic cars, particularly vintage Citroen models like the 1962 2CV she restored. Her grandfather's teachings about engines and upholstery laid the foundation for her passion, which has evolved into a business. She enjoys traveling to scavenge for rare parts and vehicles, often venturing out of her comfort zone to find hidden gems.

Additional interests might include:

* Learning about French history and culture
* Exploring rural France and discovering new countryside routes
* Collecting vintage car-related memorabilia
* Sharing her passion with others, whether through workshops or online forums

Eleanor's motto, "La vie est une roue qui tourne" (Life is a wheel that turns), reflects her adaptability and enthusiasm for life's journey, much like the turning wheels of a restored classic car.
