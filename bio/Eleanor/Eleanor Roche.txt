Here's a summary of Eleanor Roche's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Eleanor is a woman in her mid-to-late 30s. She stands at about 5'6" (168 cm) tall and has long, curly brown hair that often escapes her ponytail. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with warmth and kindness, putting those around her at ease. Her skin has a golden glow from years of spending time outdoors, whether it's baking for customers or working on her art.

**Personality:** Eleanor is a kind-hearted and warm individual who always puts others before herself. She has a natural ability to make people feel welcome and at ease, which makes her an exceptional baker and entrepreneur. However, she also has a creative and introspective side that she only reveals to those closest to her – like her grandmother Agnes Roche. Eleanor is determined, passionate, and driven, but never lets her desire for success overshadow her relationships with others.

**Interests:** Eleanor's primary interests are baking, art, and sharing her creativity with others. She finds solace in the quiet moments of her studio where she can express herself through color and canvas. Baking allows her to connect with her community and bring joy to people's lives, while painting is her escape – a way for her to tap into her inner world and process her emotions.

As she balances her life between running the bakery and pursuing her art, Eleanor remains dedicated to her values: kindness, creativity, and following one's passion.
