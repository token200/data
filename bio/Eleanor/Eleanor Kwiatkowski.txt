Here is a summary of Eleanor Kwiatkowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eleanor is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, she presents herself as confident, charismatic, and poised, able to effortlessly navigate high-society events and maintain her reputation as a top art dealer. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply guarded emotional landscape, shaped by years of resilience and determination in the face of adversity. Eleanor is fiercely independent and intensely private, with a tendency to keep people at arm's length due to past betrayals and heartbreaks.

Despite this tough exterior, Eleanor has a dry sense of humor and a wicked wit that she uses to deflect attention and protect herself from getting too close to others. She is a master manipulator, able to expertly play on the emotions and insecurities of those around her to achieve her goals.

**Physical Attributes:** Eleanor stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet curvy build, honed from years of physical labor and self-defense training as a child growing up in Chicago's rough streets. Her piercing green eyes are her most striking feature, seeming to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up for potential weakness or vulnerability.

Her raven-black hair is shoulder-length, often styled in loose waves that frame her heart-shaped face and accentuate her full lips. Eleanor has a small nose ring and a scattering of tattoos on her arms, which she keeps hidden under long sleeves at formal events.

**Interests:** At the surface level, Eleanor appears to be driven by a passion for art, particularly rare and valuable pieces that hold historical significance or high emotional value. She is an expert in various art movements, including Impressionism, Expressionism, and Abstract Expressionism, and has a keen eye for spotting potential investments.

However, as she becomes embroiled in the world of high-stakes art dealing, Eleanor's interests expand to include the darker corners of human nature – corruption, power struggles, and the gray areas between right and wrong. She is drawn to the thrill of the hunt, the rush of adrenaline that comes with uncovering hidden secrets and navigating treacherous social landscapes.

As she delves deeper into her investigation alongside Julian, Eleanor finds herself increasingly fascinated by the mysteries of human psychology and behavior, particularly as it relates to the darker aspects of art dealing. She is a seeker of truth, driven by a desire for justice and accountability in a world where corruption and deception are rampant.
