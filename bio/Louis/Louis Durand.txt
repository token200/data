Here's a summary of the fictional character Louis Durand:

**Physical Attributes:** Louis is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, given that it's been 20 years since he last set foot in his hometown. He stands around 5'10" (178 cm) tall with a slender build, which may be attributed to his profession as an architect. His eyes are a warm, hazel brown color that seems to soften the more rugged aspects of his features.

**Personality:** Louis appears to be introspective and reflective, having carried a heavy burden for years that only the ocean's soothing sounds could alleviate. He's been on a journey of self-discovery, reconnecting with his roots and finding solace in the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed. Despite his success as an architect, he seems to have lost sight of his own accomplishments, prioritizing connection over material possessions. Louis has a sense of peace about him, especially when surrounded by nature and the stories of those who came before him.

**Interests:** As evidenced by his behavior in the story, Louis is deeply interested in:

* Nature and the outdoors: He spends countless hours wandering the shore, listening to the old-timers' tales, and watching the stars twinkle over the waves.
* His hometown's history: Louis is drawn to understanding the stories of wars fought and lost, storms that ravaged the coast, and the resilience of the people who lived through them.
* Family and heritage: The discovery of his mother's locket serves as a catalyst for Louis' newfound connection to his past and his sense of home.

**Additional Insights:** Louis seems to be someone who values simplicity over luxury, preferring the quiet rhythms of life in Saint-Pierre over the fast-paced city. His experience with loss (his mother's passing) has given him a deeper appreciation for the present moment and a desire to reconnect with his roots.
