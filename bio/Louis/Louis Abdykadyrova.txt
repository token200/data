As an outsider in both Russian and Uzbek cultures, Louis has developed a strong sense of empathy and openness, allowing him to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms through his art.

Despite his struggles with identity, Louis is incredibly resilient and determined. His passion for social justice and human rights fuels his creativity and motivates him to create work that sparks important conversations.

As an artist, Louis is also deeply interested in exploring themes of identity, displacement, and belonging through his work. He draws inspiration from personal experiences, historical events, and social justice movements to create art that resonates with others.

When not creating, Louis enjoys practicing yoga, reading poetry and short stories, and exploring the urban landscapes of Moscow and Tashkent for inspiration. His art studio is a reflection of his eclectic interests, filled with books, instruments, and textiles that reflect his Uzbek heritage.
