Kaneko is enigmatic and reserved, preferring to keep to herself in public. However, those who have had the privilege of interacting with her describe her as warm, introspective, and intensely passionate about her art. She has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but this is often hidden beneath a layer of wit and intelligence. Kaneko values authenticity and honesty above all else, which makes her an elusive figure in the art world.
