Here is a summary of Kaneko Dubois' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Kaneko Dubois is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, she appears tough, resourceful, and calculating, having spent years honing her skills as a con artist. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of empathy and compassion, earned through her experiences in the underworld and her subsequent transformation. Kaneko is fiercely independent and self-reliant, but also has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those she cares about. Her past experiences have left emotional scars, but she has learned to channel these into her work as a private investigator.

**Physical Attributes:** Kaneko stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of physical activity while evading capture or escaping danger. Her eyes are an piercing green, often seeming to bore into those she encounters. Her dark hair is cut short and practical, often styled in a sleek ponytail that allows her to move freely.

**Interests:** Kaneko's interests lie at the intersection of her past life as a con artist and her current work as a private investigator. She has a deep knowledge of the underworld, including its hidden networks, codes, and customs. Outside of work, Kaneko enjoys playing poker (often in high-stakes games) and attending underground events where she can stay connected to her old network.

In addition, Kaneko is an avid reader of true crime novels and documentaries, drawn to the puzzle-solving aspect of these cases. She also has a passion for classic cars and owns a sleek black Mustang that serves as her mobile office.

It's worth noting that while Kaneko Dubois has a rich inner life, she may come across as guarded or aloof to those who don't know her. This is partly due to her years of living in the shadows, but also because she is still learning to trust others and form genuine connections with those around her.
