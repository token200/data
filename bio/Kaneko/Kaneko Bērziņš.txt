Based on the short story provided, I will create a fictional character profile for Kaneko Bērziņš:

**Personality:** Kaneko is a quiet and introspective individual with a passion for art. He is contemplative and thoughtful, often getting lost in his own world of colors and textures. Despite his introverted nature, he has a kind heart and is drawn to people who share similar interests.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, reminiscent of a clear night sky
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, artistic manner
* Skin Tone: Light with a subtle golden glow from spending time outdoors

**Interests:** As an artist, Kaneko's primary interest is painting. He loves exploring different techniques, colors, and textures to create unique pieces of art. He is also drawn to nature, especially the beauty of cherry blossoms, which inspired his most memorable piece in Yumi-san's antique shop.

Additionally, Kaneko develops a deep appreciation for antiques, collecting peculiar trinkets and treasures, much like Yumi-san. This newfound interest stems from his encounters with her in Mori no Ki.

**Other Traits:** Kaneko is a curious soul, often wandering through streets and alleys to discover new places and people. He values genuine connections and meaningful conversations, which led him to bond strongly with Yumi-san over their shared love of art.
