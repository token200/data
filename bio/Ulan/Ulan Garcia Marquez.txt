**Personality:** Ulan is a free-spirited individual with an infectious energy that draws people to her. She is passionate about music and dance, which takes her to the streets every night, lost in the rhythm and joy it brings her. Her spirit is contagious, making her feet seem to move on their own as she dances through crowded streets.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Ulan stands at 5'8" (173 cm), with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: Her eyes sparkle with a bright blue-green hue that seems almost iridescent in the right light, reflecting her vibrant personality and connection to the music.
* Hair: Ulan has long, curly dark hair that falls down her back like a waterfall of night. Her locks are often adorned with colorful flowers or ribbons, adding to her whimsical charm.

**Interests:** Music, dance, and movement are at the heart of Ulan's existence. She finds solace in the rhythmic beats and vibrant melodies that pulse through the streets of Cartagena. When she dances, she is fully immersed in the moment, letting go of all constraints and allowing her spirit to soar.

As Ulan continues to dance and move with the rhythm of her heart, her love for music becomes an integral part of who she is. Her legendary dance moves have captured the hearts of many, but it's clear that her true passion lies not just in movement, but in the connection and joy she shares with those around her – particularly Alejandro, her partner in every sense of the word.
