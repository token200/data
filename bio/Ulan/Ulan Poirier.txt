Based on the inspiration provided by the short story about Ulan Poirier, here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ulan Poirier is a complex and enigmatic individual with a mysterious aura surrounding him. He is a man of great courage and resilience, having honed his survival skills in the harsh environments of North Africa and Russia. His experiences have taught him to be resourceful, adaptable, and fiercely independent. However, he also has a tendency to push people away and maintain emotional distance, which can make it difficult for others to get close to him. Despite this, he possesses a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic at times.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
* Eye Color: piercing blue, with a hint of green around the iris
* Hair Color: dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
* Build: lean and athletic, honed from years of military training and survival in harsh environments

**Interests:** Ulan's interests are varied and often focused on the thrill of adventure and the challenge of navigating complex situations. He is a skilled marksman, martial artist, and tactician, with expertise in infiltration, sabotage, and tactical operations. In his downtime, he enjoys reading about history, particularly the stories of military leaders and conquerors. He also has a fascination with Eastern European folklore and mythology, which seems to draw him into the mysteries that Sofia sets for him.

It's worth noting that Ulan's past is shrouded in secrecy, making it difficult to discern more details about his personality, interests, or motivations beyond what has been revealed through his interactions with Sofia. However, based on the brief glimpse we have of him, it's clear that he is a man who lives by his own rules and operates outside the boundaries of conventional society.
