Here's a summary of the fictional character Ulan Olsson:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Age: Late 20s
- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
- Weight: Lean and athletic build, indicating years of physical labor in the fields.
- Eye Color: Bright blue, often described as piercing or intense.

**Personality:**
Ulan is a rugged individualist with a strong sense of independence. He's been living off the land for most of his life, spending hours exploring the forests and fields around his home in rural Sweden. This has made him self-reliant and resourceful, able to think on his feet and handle unexpected situations. Despite his tough exterior, he has a curious streak and is not opposed to trying new things.

**Interests:**
Ulan's primary interests lie in the natural world and manual labor. He enjoys exploring the outdoors, fixing machines, and working with his hands. As a farmer, he's developed a deep understanding of the land and its rhythms, which has given him a strong connection to the earth and its resources. However, his encounter with Marcus and his proposed project sparks a new interest in technology and innovation, suggesting that Ulan may have a hidden talent for inventing or engineering.

It's also worth noting that Ulan's past experiences and interactions with people like Marcus suggest that he may be somewhat of a loner, content to spend time alone, but not opposed to forming connections with others. His introduction to the world of wind power generation represents a potential shift in his priorities and interests, one that could lead him down a path of discovery and adventure.
