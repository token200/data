**Physical Attributes:**
Ulan Viljanen stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a striking feature, shining like the stars on a clear night - a piercing blue color that seems almost otherworldly. His hair is dark brown, often kept neatly trimmed and pulled back from his face, revealing high cheekbones and a pointed chin.

**Personality:**
Ulan Viljanen exudes an air of mystery and confidence, his presence commanding attention without being overtly dominant. He is intensely focused on his goals, often to the point of obsession, but beneath this drive lies a deep-seated need for connection and belonging. His natural affinity for magic has made him both powerful and wary, as he navigates the complex web of alliances and rivalries that define the world of magic.

**Interests:**
Ulan Viljanen is drawn to the mystical and the unknown, often seeking out ancient texts, forgotten lore, and hidden artifacts that hold the key to unlocking new powers. He has a particular fascination with the concept of soul-selling and the blurred lines between morality and ambition. In his free time, he enjoys experimenting with potions and elixirs in his apothecary's workshop, carefully crafting each concoction to achieve specific effects.

In terms of interests beyond magic, Ulan Viljanen appears to have a mild curiosity for history, particularly the stories of forgotten empires and lost civilizations. He is also known to enjoy observing the city's underbelly at night, drawn to the whispers of rumors and half-truths that seem to seep from every alleyway and corner.

Despite his enigmatic nature, Ulan Viljanen has a deep-seated desire for connection and belonging, particularly when it comes to Elara Moonwhisper. His interest in her quest for the rare artifact is driven by more than just curiosity - he feels an inexplicable pull towards her, as if their paths are destined to cross in the most unexpected of ways.
