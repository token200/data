Based on the short story provided, I've created a character profile for Sébastien Krūmiņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sébastien is a 25-year-old man. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, which allows him to easily navigate through Riga's streets on his bicycle. His hair is likely dark brown or black, and his eyes are a bright, expressive blue that reflect his passion for photography. Sébastien has a lean build, honed from years of cycling through the city.

**Personality:**
Sébastien is a creative and introspective person who finds joy in capturing moments of beauty through his lens. He is passionate about his work as a freelance photographer and is always on the lookout for new inspiration. Sébastien is likely introverted, preferring to spend time alone with his camera rather than in large social groups. However, he has a strong sense of community and values connecting with like-minded individuals who share his passion for photography.

**Interests:**
As mentioned in the short story, Sébastien's main interest is urban landscape photography. He has a particular fondness for capturing the intricate details and textures of Riga's historic architecture. When not working on photography projects, Sébastien likely enjoys experimenting with new techniques, practicing his craft, and exploring the city's hidden corners.

**Additional Traits:**
Sébastien appears to be resourceful and independent, having built a successful freelance career through hard work and dedication. He is also meticulous in his approach to editing and post-processing his photos, taking the time to carefully craft each image to convey his vision. Despite the demands of his job, Sébastien seems content with his lifestyle, finding joy in the everyday moments that make Riga's urban landscape so unique.
