Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Sébastien Arjona:

**Personality:** Sébastien is a creative and introspective person. He has a passion for music that drives him, but also struggles with self-doubt and frustration due to his unconventional approach. Despite this, he is deeply emotional and expressive, pouring all his feelings into his music. He's shy and hesitant at times, but once someone shows genuine interest in his art, he opens up and shares himself freely.

**Physical Attributes:** Sébastien stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to hold a world of emotion within them. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his face with a faintly troubled expression.

**Interests:** Sébastien's primary interest is music - specifically playing the piano and writing songs. He's deeply passionate about his craft and spends most of his free time honing his skills or working on new compositions. He's also a bit of a daydreamer, often lost in thought as he stares out windows or gazes at candles flickering on his piano bench.

It's worth noting that the short story doesn't provide many specific details about Sébastien's personality, physical appearance, or interests beyond what's mentioned here. However, based on the narrative, we can infer that he values creativity and emotional expression above all else, and is willing to take risks to pursue his artistic vision.
