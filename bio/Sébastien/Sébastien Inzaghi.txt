**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright Blue

**Personality:** Sébastien is an endearingly clumsy and lovable amateur spy who often finds himself in absurd situations. He possesses a childlike sense of curiosity and enthusiasm for gadgets, which can sometimes lead to his downfall. His bumbling nature often results in comical mishaps, but he never gives up and always manages to bounce back.

**Interests:** Sébastien has a strong passion for tinkering with gadgets and machinery, as evident from his childhood habit of sneaking into his parents' shed. He also has an extensive collection of novelty hats and enjoys playing the accordion. In addition, Sébastien is fascinated by technology, particularly surveillance systems and hacking.

**Hobbies:** Outside of his spy work (which he isn't exactly cut out for), Sébastien enjoys experimenting with new gadgets, attending novelty hat sales, and watching cat videos.

**Strengths:** While not extremely skilled in the field of espionage, Sébastien's resourcefulness, creativity, and ability to think on his feet make him a valuable asset to Les Loups. He is also quite charismatic, which helps him charm (or deceive) people into believing he's more competent than he actually is.

**Weaknesses:** Sébastien's biggest weakness lies in his tendency to get overconfident and act impulsively, leading to his entanglement in a series of absurd situations.
