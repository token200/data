Here's a summary of Sébastien Horváth's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Sébastien is a complex and introspective individual. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as gruff or unapproachable to those who don't know him. However, he is also deeply emotional and vulnerable, particularly when it comes to his music and memories of his past. As a detective, he has likely developed a tough exterior to cope with the darkness he encounters in his line of work, but this façade cracks as he confronts his own traumatic experiences.

**Physical Attributes:** Sébastien is likely a tall and slender individual, possibly around 6'1" (185 cm) or taller. His eye color is blue, which is not explicitly mentioned in the story but seems fitting given the French setting and cultural context. His hair is dark brown, and he has a few days' worth of stubble, giving him a slightly rough-around-the-edges appearance.

**Interests:** Sébastien's passion for music is evident throughout the story. He plays the piano with incredible skill, but also struggles to reconnect with his musical past after his parents' accident left him with amnesia. As a detective, he has likely developed a strong attention to detail and analytical mind, skills that serve him well in solving complex cases. However, it's clear that music is his true passion, and he finds solace in playing the piano as a way to confront his past and reconnect with his sense of self.

Overall, Sébastien is a multifaceted character who has been shaped by both the traumatic events of his childhood and the darkness of his work as a detective. His struggles to come to terms with his past and find closure through music make him a deeply relatable and sympathetic protagonist.
