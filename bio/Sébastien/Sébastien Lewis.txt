Here is a summary of Sébastien Lewis's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sébastien is a young, ambitious, and passionate individual who is driven by his desire to capture life's most precious moments through photography. He is determined, hardworking, and willing to put in the effort necessary to achieve his goals. Sébastien has a strong sense of gratitude and humility, as evident in his appreciation for Léa's trust and support.

**Physical Attributes:** Sébastien is likely in his mid-twenties. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, allowing him to comfortably roam the streets of Paris while carrying his camera equipment. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that sparkle with creativity and enthusiasm whenever he's behind the lens.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Sébastien has a deep passion for capturing the beauty of the world around him. He loves exploring the streets of Paris, discovering hidden gems, and experimenting with different techniques to create stunning images. In addition to his work in photography, Sébastien is also interested in music, particularly jazz and classical genres, which Léa's style resonates with. When he's not behind the camera, Sébastien enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to clear his mind and stay focused.

It's worth noting that the physical attributes, such as height and eye color, were made up for this summary, but I tried to make them fit the character description provided in the original story.
