He is fiercely determined to push boundaries in his work, but struggles with vulnerability and openness in his personal life.

**Interests:** Sébastien's interests are deeply rooted in fashion, design, and creativity. As a fashion designer, he is passionate about innovation and pushing the boundaries of style. He is also an avid art collector and enjoys attending exclusive fashion events and exhibitions.

Outside of his work, Sébastien has a deep love for music, particularly French music from the 1960s and 1970s. He often finds solace in the lyrics and melodies of Edith Piaf, Édith Griset, and Serge Gainsbourg, which remind him of his childhood and his tumultuous past.
