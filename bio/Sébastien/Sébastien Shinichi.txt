Sébastien Shinichi stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are an piercing shade of emerald green, a trait that seems to gleam with mischief in the right light. His dark hair is often neatly styled, framing his chiseled features and sharp jawline.

**Personality:**
Sébastien Shinichi is a master manipulator, using his intelligence, charisma, and cunning to get what he wants. As "The Fox," he exudes confidence and an aura of invincibility, making it impossible for most people to suspect the truth about him. Despite his tough exterior, Sébastien has a dry sense of humor and can be surprisingly vulnerable when pushed beyond his limits.

**Interests:**
Sébastien Shinichi is deeply passionate about his craft, spending countless hours honing his skills in stealth, deception, and misdirection. He is particularly fascinated by the art of Ninjutsu, an ancient Japanese martial art that combines physical prowess with mental discipline. Outside of his work as a thief, Sébastien enjoys collecting rare and exotic artifacts, often incorporating them into his elaborate heists.

Sébastien's interests also extend to literature and philosophy, often seeking out obscure texts on strategy, psychology, and ethics. He finds solace in the works of Japanese philosophers like Zen master Dogen, who taught him that "to study the Buddha Way is to study the self."

**Other Quirks:**

These trinkets often hold sentimental value or provide inspiration for future scams. He is also known to wear a custom-made silver fox pendant around his neck, a symbol that represents his alias and serves as a reminder of his past.

Despite his many secrets, Sébastien Shinichi remains fiercely loyal to those he considers friends, using his skills to protect them when necessary. However, his reputation as "The Fox" precedes him, making it difficult for anyone to get close enough to know the real man behind the legend.
