Here's a summary of Sébastien Wolf's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sébastien is a complex and introspective individual with a rich inner life. He's a perfectionist and a demanding writer who dedicates himself to his craft. Despite his tough exterior as a literary critic, he has a deep emotional vulnerability that he only reveals to those close to him, such as Emma. His intensity and passion for storytelling drive him to create worlds that blur the lines between reality and fiction.

**Physical Attributes:** Sébastien is a slender man in his late 30s with an ethereal quality to his features. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, which belies his introverted nature. His pale skin seems almost translucent in the flickering candlelight, accentuating the sharp angles of his face. His most striking feature is his unsettling shade of yellow eyes, which seem to gleam with intensity when he's immersed in his writing.

**Interests:** Sébastien's primary interest is writing, particularly fiction and literary criticism. He's obsessed with storytelling and the art of crafting complex narratives that transport readers to other worlds. His passion for literature drives him to create works that explore the human condition, often delving into dark and intense themes. When not writing, he can be found studying dusty books on philosophy, psychology, or mythology, which fuel his imagination and inspire new ideas.

It's worth noting that Sébastien's interests and personality traits are closely intertwined with his writing process. His creative energy is fueled by his ability to immerse himself in the world of his stories, and he often loses track of time and reality when he's working on a manuscript.
