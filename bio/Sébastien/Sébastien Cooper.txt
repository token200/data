Here is a summary of Sébastien Cooper's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sébastien stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a piercing blue, a color that seems to see right through you. His dark brown hair is often styled in a way that frames his face, adding to his enigmatic presence. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures.

**Personality:** Sébastien is a complex and intriguing individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he appears confident, charming, and calculating - always thinking several steps ahead. However, beneath this mask lies a deep sense of independence and a drive to survive in a world that often seeks to control him. Sébastien is fiercely loyal to those he trusts, but his nature as a master manipulator makes it difficult for others to know what to believe about him.

**Interests:** Sébastien's interests are varied and eclectic, reflecting his diverse experiences and passions. He has a deep love of history, particularly the stories of sailors, soldiers, and outlaws who lived on the fringes of society. Music is another passion of his, with a particular fondness for jazz and blues that allow him to tap into his own inner rhythms. Sébastien also enjoys fine art, collecting works by artists who push the boundaries of what is acceptable.

Despite his many interests, Sébastien's true love is adventure itself - whether it's traveling, exploring new places, or taking on high-stakes challenges. He has a taste for excitement and danger, which drives him to pursue careers that offer the thrill of the unknown.

In short, Sébastien Cooper is a man of many contradictions: a master manipulator with a heart of gold; a free spirit bound by his own sense of duty; an outsider who can be trusted when it counts.
