Based on the short story, here's a summary of Roberts Kovács' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Roberts Kovács appears to be a introspective and emotional individual. He is deeply connected to his memories and experiences, particularly those related to his deceased partner, József. His personality suggests that he is sensitive, empathetic, and possibly haunted by the past. However, there's also a hint of resilience and determination in his actions as he copes with loss.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: Kovács stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), which allows him to navigate the cityscape comfortably while still being mindful of his physical presence.
- Eye Color: His eyes are an unsettling shade of blue, almost like a dark stormy night sky. They hold a depth that seems to reveal fragments of the past and present simultaneously.

**Interests:** Given Kovács' emotional state, it can be inferred that he finds solace in memories, letters, writing, and contemplation. He is deeply connected to his partner József and has a profound respect for duty and loyalty (as symbolized by József's mantra). His time on the rooftop often seems like an escape into the past rather than a moment of solitude. The act of writing a letter serves as a way for Kovács to bridge the gap between his memories, grief, and moving forward.
