Here's a summary of Roberts Straume's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Roberts "Bob" Straume is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On one hand, he has a sharp mind and keen instincts that have earned him a reputation as one of the best detectives in Oslo. He is intelligent, analytical, and able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. However, he also has a restless spirit and a desire for adventure, which often puts him at odds with his more structured life as a detective. This dichotomy suggests that Bob is a deeply curious person who is driven by a sense of intrigue and a need for truth.

**Physical Attributes:** According to the story, we don't have much information about Bob's physical appearance beyond his eye color (not mentioned specifically). However, we can make an educated guess based on Norwegian culture. Many Norwegians are tall, so let's assume Bob stands at around 6 feet (183 cm) tall. His hair is described as "whipping" in the wind, suggesting that it might be dark brown or blonde. As for his eyes, since he's Norwegian, we can guess they're likely blue or green.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that Bob has a passion for mystery, crime-solving, and the unknown. He is drawn to the unexplained and the cryptic, which suggests that he is someone who values intellectual curiosity and is willing to challenge his own assumptions. As a detective, he has honed his skills in observing details and piecing together seemingly unrelated facts. Outside of work, Bob appears to be someone who enjoys spending time in nature, particularly by water (as hinted at by the fjord scene). He also seems to have a sense of restlessness, which suggests that he may be searching for something more meaningful or fulfilling beyond his career as a detective.

Of course, these are just interpretations based on a short story, but they provide a starting point for understanding Roberts Straume's personality and interests.
