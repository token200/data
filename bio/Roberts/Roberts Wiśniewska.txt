Based on the inspiration from Robert Wiśniewski, I will create a new fictional character with similar characteristics.

Name: Roberts Wiśniewska (same surname as the Polish writer, but different first name)

Personality:
Roberts Wiśniewska is a introspective and creative individual with a deep love for literature. He has a dry sense of humor and often uses it to deflect from his own emotions. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support them.

Physical Attributes:

- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark Brown
- Hair Color: Light Brown
- Facial Features: Roberts has a strong jawline, high cheekbones, and piercing brown eyes that seem to see right through you.
- Style: He dresses in layers, often favoring cardigans over suits. This makes him appear endearingly awkward.

Interests:

Roberts is an avid reader and poet. He spends most of his free time reading classical literature, attending poetry readings, and writing his own stories. His love for literature has inspired many people around him, including his closest friends and family members.

Additional details:
- Roberts works as a part-time librarian at a local library where he can surround himself with books and share his passion for literature with others.
- He is also an amateur photographer who captures the beauty of nature in his city. His photos are often filled with subtle symbolism that hints at his love for poetry and storytelling.

Overall, Roberts Wiśniewska is a creative soul with a deep appreciation for the written word and the world around him.
