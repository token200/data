Maarika stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her raven-black hair falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face and piercing emerald green eyes that seem to hold a world of secrets. Her skin is as pale as alabaster, with a subtle sheen that hints at her affinity for magic.

Maarika exudes an air of quiet confidence and authority, commanding respect without demanding it. Her enigmatic smile can disarm even the most skeptical of souls, while her sharp mind and quick wit make her a formidable opponent in debates and arguments. Despite her growing reputation as a healer and seer, Maarika remains humble and introspective, preferring to observe and listen rather than speak.

**Interests:**
Maarika's fascination with the mysterious and unknown began at a young age, fueled by a passion for reading about witchcraft, ancient magic, and mythology. As she grew older, her interests expanded to include herbalism, divination, and spellcraft, which she honed under the guidance of the town's elderly wisewoman. Maarika is also drawn to the mystical and esoteric, often finding herself lost in the pages of ancient tomes or seeking guidance from celestial bodies and omens.

In her free time, Maarika enjoys tending to her garden, where she cultivates rare herbs and flowers with magical properties. She is also an avid listener, often sitting for hours by the fireplace, listening to stories and legends passed down through generations of wisewomen in her family. Despite her many responsibilities as a healer and seer, Maarika finds solace in the quiet moments of contemplation, where she can connect with the mysteries of the universe.
