**Personality:**

Zhang Bērziņš is a complex and intriguing individual. He has a quiet confidence that commands respect, but he is not one to seek the spotlight.

**Interests:**

Zhang Bērziņš is a man of few but fierce passions. He is an avid practitioner of Tai Chi and Wing Chun, often meditating for hours to center himself.

He speaks fluent Latvian, English, and Mandarin, having grown up in a multicultural environment.
