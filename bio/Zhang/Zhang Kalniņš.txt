Based on the story about Kalniņš, I've created a fictional character profile for Zhang Kalniņš:

Name: Zhang Kalniņš

Height: 5'10" (178 cm)

Physical Attributes: Zhang has an athletic build, with broad shoulders and a lean physique. His dark brown hair is often tousled, giving him a charmingly unkempt look. His warm hazel eyes sparkle with creativity, revealing a depth of emotion that hints at his artistic soul.

Personality: Like Kalniņš, Zhang is quiet and reserved, preferring to let his art speak for itself. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a creative genius who is deeply passionate about his craft. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as introspective, but once you get to know him, he reveals a kind and empathetic heart.

Interests: Zhang is an avid collector of rare art books and documentaries about the history of art. He loves to explore new cities and immerse himself in different cultures, which often inspires his artwork. Like Kalniņš, Zhang is also drawn to classical music, often listening to Chopin or Debussy while he paints.

In terms of specific interests, Zhang has a fascination with traditional Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, which he sees as an art form that embodies the same principles of balance and harmony found in his own work. He's also an avid reader of poetry and philosophy, often seeking inspiration from the works of Taoist masters like Lao Tzu.

While Kalniņš's full name is given as Žilts, I've chosen a variation for Zhang that still reflects his Latvian heritage while being distinct enough to stand on its own. The "Ž" in his name echoes the "Ž" sound found in many Latvian surnames, paying homage to Kalniņš's roots without being too on-the-nose.
