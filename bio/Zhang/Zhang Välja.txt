I'd be happy to create a new character profile for Zhang Välja and write a story based on that. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
Eye Color: Piercing green
Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled with a messy, piecey look
Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a subtle scattering of freckles across his cheeks

**Personality:**
Zhang Välja is a charismatic and cunning individual with a quick wit and a sharp tongue. He has a natural talent for manipulation, using his charm and wit to get out of sticky situations or talk his way into someone's trust. Despite his roguish tendencies, Zhang has a dry sense of humor and can be quite self-deprecating when the mood strikes him.

**Background:**
Zhang Välja hails from a humble background in the city's lower districts, where he grew up surrounded by the smells of street food and the sounds of merchants hawking their wares. He developed his skills as a thief and forger from a young age, learning the ins and outs of the city's hidden corners and back alleys. As he honed his craft, Zhang began to attract attention from some of the more influential figures in the city, who saw potential in the young scamp.

**Interests:**
Zhang Välja has a passion for antiques and rare artifacts, often spending hours scouring the markets for unique and valuable items to add to his collection. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on everything from philosophy to cryptography (a skill he uses to great effect in his own line of work). In his downtime, Zhang enjoys sipping tea at a local café and watching the world go by through the window.

**Goals:**
Zhang Välja's ultimate goal is to leave the shadows behind and become a respected figure in society - perhaps as an antiquarian collector or a skilled cryptologist. However, for now, he remains content to operate on the fringes of the law, using his talents to get by and stay one step ahead of his enemies.

Now that we have Zhang Välja's character profile fleshed out, would you like me to continue with the story as described in the opening paragraph?
