Here's a summary of Zhang Leblanc's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Zhang Leblanc stands at 5'9" (175 cm) tall with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a striking shade of indigo, which seem to gleam with intensity in the right light. His hair is a dark, chestnut brown color that falls across his forehead in messy, piecey locks. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which he obtained during a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Zhang Leblanc is a complex and enigmatic individual with a personality that's both captivating and infuriating at the same time. He's fiercely intelligent and intensely curious, often finding himself drawn to puzzles and mysteries that others might find unsolvable. However, this drive for knowledge can sometimes make him come across as aloof or dismissive, which has led many people to underestimate him. Despite this, he's deeply empathetic and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

**Interests:** Zhang Leblanc is a voracious learner with a particular fascination for the intersection of technology and philosophy. He spends most of his free time devouring books on artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and existentialism, and is known to geek out over complex algorithms and theoretical frameworks. When not buried in a book or tinkering with gadgets, he enjoys playing the cello, practicing martial arts, and exploring the urban jungle.

Of course, all these details are inspired by your prompt, and I tried my best to make them up while still being coherent and fitting for the character.
