Based on the story about Zhang Pong, I've created a new character profile for Zhang Pold:

Name: Zhang Pold

Personality: Zhang Pold is a brave and compassionate warrior, known for his unwavering dedication to justice. He possesses a strong sense of morality and empathy, which guides his actions and decisions. Like his namesake, Zhang Pong, Zhang Pold is humble and unassuming, preferring to let his actions speak louder than words.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep blue

Interests:
Zhang Pold has a passion for martial arts, particularly the art of Aikido. He believes that the true strength lies not in physical power, but in harmony and balance with one's surroundings.

He is also an avid learner and student of history, philosophy, and literature. Zhang Pold seeks to understand the complexities of human nature and the world around him, often finding inspiration in ancient texts and wise sayings.

Zhang Pold's love for nature and the outdoors leads him to practice meditation and spending time in solitude, allowing him to connect with his inner self and find peace in a chaotic world.
