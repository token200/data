Based on the story about General Zhuge Liang, I'll create a fictional character profile for Zhang Wójcik:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing brown
- Hair Color: Jet black, often worn long and tied in a ponytail
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

Personality:
Zhang Wójcik is a strategic thinker with an unyielding determination to protect his people. He possesses a dry wit and can come across as aloof or reserved, but beneath his calm exterior lies a fiery passion for justice.

As a military leader, Zhang Wójcik values honor and loyalty above all else. He inspires devotion in those who follow him by being fair, yet resolute in his decisions. His keen intellect makes him an exceptional strategist, always staying one step ahead of his adversaries.

Interests:
In his rare moments of downtime, Zhang Wójcik enjoys reading classical literature and poetry from ancient China. He also practices calligraphy and is known to be an accomplished artist, often sketching maps and plans on the walls of his chambers.

As a martial artist, he trains regularly in Tai Chi and other forms of Chinese martial arts. His dedication to discipline and self-control allows him to stay centered amidst the chaos of battle.

Zhang Wójcik's love for nature is evident in his reverence for the natural world. He often finds solace in quiet contemplation by a nearby river or mountain range, allowing him to clear his mind and focus on the challenges ahead.

While inspired by General Zhuge Liang's legacy, Zhang Wójcik operates as a unique individual with his own strengths and weaknesses. His unwavering commitment to justice will be tested as he navigates the complexities of war and leadership.
