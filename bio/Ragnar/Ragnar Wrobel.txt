Here's a summary of Ragnar Wrobel's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a hint of grey that seems to deepen in intensity when he's speaking about his passion for rare knowledge.
* Hair: Dark brown, thinning at the temples, and often slicked back to reveal a prominent forehead.
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a wiriness that belies a physical strength honed from years of living on the streets.

**Personality:**

* Enigmatic and elusive, Ragnar is a master of subtlety, preferring to observe rather than be observed.
* He exudes an air of quiet confidence, as if he knows secrets that no one else can understand.
* Determined and unyielding, Ragnar is driven by a passion for discovery and knowledge that borders on obsession.
* Despite his tough exterior, there's a hint of vulnerability beneath the surface, suggesting that he's not invincible.

**Interests:**

* Rare books and manuscripts, particularly those containing forbidden or esoteric knowledge.
* The music box produced in the abandoned warehouse was an example of his appreciation for the intricate and beautiful craftsmanship that often lies behind a treasure's true value.
* Exploration and discovery, whether it's rummaging through dusty trunks or tracking down rare artifacts.
* Music, which seems to evoke a deep emotional response from Ragnar when he winds up the music box.

These interests suggest that Ragnar is driven by a love of knowledge and beauty, as well as a desire for adventure and exploration. His background as a humble bookseller has clearly shaped his perspective on life, but it's his passion for rare and forbidden knowledge that has led him down a path of deception and danger.
