Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ragnar Lemoine:

**Personality:** Ragnar is a rugged and confident individual with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. He commands respect through his firm but controlled demeanor, yet has a compassionate side that he showcases when interacting with those in need. Despite his tough exterior, he is introspective and often reflects on his past choices, demonstrating a depth to his character.

**Physical Attributes:** Ragnar stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is messy and unkempt, framing his sharp jawline and angular cheekbones. A silver earring glints in his left earlobe, a token from his days as a sailor. His rugged features command attention wherever he goes.

**Interests:** Ragnar's life has been shaped by his experiences on the high seas, where he developed an insatiable hunger for adventure and discovery. Before joining the city watch, he was drawn to exploration and navigation, but ultimately chose to put down roots and serve his community instead. He remains interested in exploring the world beyond his city, though perhaps not as actively as during his days as a sailor. As a member of the city watch, Ragnar is deeply invested in protecting its people and keeping them safe from harm.

These attributes are woven together to create a well-rounded character with a complex past and present.
