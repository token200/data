Here's a summary of Ragnar Petrenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ragnar is an intense and driven individual, consumed by his passion for archaeology and discovery. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of determination, which often leads him to take risks that others might avoid. However, this drive can also make him come across as aloof or dismissive of others' concerns, as seen in his initial hesitation to leave Zerzura despite the eerie whispers. Despite this, Ragnar is deeply curious and has a childlike sense of wonder, as evident in his excitement upon discovering the lost city.

**Physical Attributes:** Ragnar stands at approximately 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build that speaks to his years of navigating treacherous terrain. His eyes are an unsettling shade of blue-green, reminiscent of a desert sunset, which seem almost piercing in their intensity. His dark brown hair is often unkempt and worn, framing a weathered face etched with deep lines from years of sun exposure and exhaustion.

**Interests:** Ragnar's primary interest lies in archaeology, particularly the study of ancient civilizations like Zerzura. He is consumed by the desire to uncover hidden secrets, understand the culture and traditions of long-lost societies, and unravel the mysteries of the past. This drive has led him to neglect his relationships with colleagues and friends back in Europe, who often worry about his obsession. Ragnar's interest also extends beyond archaeology, as he becomes increasingly fascinated by the existential questions that Zerzura poses, delving into philosophical and metaphysical topics.

Overall, Ragnar Petrenko is a complex and multifaceted character, driven by both intellectual curiosity and a sense of adventure, with a deep respect for the unknown and an unyielding determination to uncover the secrets of the past.
