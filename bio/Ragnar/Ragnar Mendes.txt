Here is a summary of Ragnar Mendes' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ragnar is a complex individual with a mix of confident and vulnerable traits. As a young player, he was driven by a desire for glory and adoration, which led him to be fiercely competitive and passionate about the game. However, as he grew older, his ego and temper often got the better of him, causing friction with coaches and teammates. Despite this, Ragnar is fiercely loyal and protective of those close to him, particularly his daughter Luna. He is also intensely introspective, haunted by regrets and "what ifs" that continue to plague him.

**Physical Attributes:**

As he aged, Ragnar's once-chiseled features have given way to the lines of time and regret. His hair is now graying at the temples, and his eyes seem to hold more weight than they did in his playing days.

**Interests:** Despite no longer being actively involved in professional football, Ragnar remains deeply passionate about the game. He spends much of his time reflecting on his career and replaying past matches in his mind, seeking closure and answers to the questions that continue to haunt him. However, as he begins to pass the torch to his daughter Luna, Ragnar is excited to rediscover a sense of purpose and meaning in life.

Ragnar's interests outside of football include spending time with his family, particularly his daughter Luna, whom he hopes will carry on his legacy and achieve greatness in her own right. He also enjoys tinkering with old football memorabilia and watching vintage matches on TV, seeking to relive the thrill of competition without the pressure of performance.
