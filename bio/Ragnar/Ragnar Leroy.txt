**Physical Attributes:**
Ragnar Leroy stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with a rugged, athletic build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that suggests a man who has spent too much time outdoors. His eyes are a piercing blue, reminiscent of the icy glacial lakes he hopes to explore on his journey. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly harrowing adventure while studying Viking Age sagas.

**Personality:**
Ragnar Leroy is a introspective and contemplative individual who values solitude and connection with nature. He is deeply curious about the world around him and has a passion for learning and discovery. As a professor of Nordic studies, he has spent years studying the sagas of the Viking Age and pouring over dusty tomes in forgotten libraries. However, now that he has embarked on this personal journey, he is no longer content to simply observe from afar - he wants to immerse himself in the land and culture he has studied for so long.

**Interests:**
Ragnar Leroy's interests are deeply rooted in his love of nature, history, and culture. As a professor of Nordic studies, he has always been fascinated by the sagas of the Viking Age and spent years studying the legends, myths, and customs of ancient Scandinavia.

As he hikes through the Highlands, Ragnar Leroy finds himself drawn to the beauty and power of the natural world. He marvels at the glaciers, fjords, and waterfalls, and feels a deep sense of kinship with the land itself. This journey is not just about personal growth or academic discovery - it's also about reconnecting with his own roots and finding a deeper sense of purpose in life.
