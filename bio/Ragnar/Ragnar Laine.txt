**Personality:**
Ragnar Laine is a bold, determined, and ambitious warrior with an insatiable urge to explore the world beyond his village. He is confident in his abilities and is not afraid to take risks. His courage and unrelenting determination have earned him respect from others, including his peers and even his enemies. Ragnar is also shown to be humble and proud at the same time, as he accepts the praise of the villagers while also being mindful of his own limitations.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** 6 feet (183 cm)
- **Weight:** athletic build, likely around 170 pounds (77 kg)

Ragnar's physical attributes suggest a tall and lean warrior with impressive strength and agility. His eye color is described as piercing blue, which could be an intimidating feature on the battlefield.

**Interests:**
Ragnar's interests seem to revolve around combat, exploration, and self-improvement. As a young boy, he watched his father train in combat and quickly mastered various techniques himself. He has a strong desire for adventure and is eager to explore the world beyond NÃ¸rhaven.
