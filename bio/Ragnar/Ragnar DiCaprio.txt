Based on the inspiration from the short story about Leonardo DiCaprio, I've created a fictional character profile for Ragnar DiCaprio:

**Name:** Ragnar DiCaprio (though this name bears no resemblance to the real person)

**Age:** 37 (comparable to Leonardo DiCaprio's age during the time period of the original story)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown with hints of auburn

**Personality:** Ragnar is an ambitious and passionate individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is driven by a strong sense of social justice and is deeply committed to making a positive impact on the world. Like Leonardo DiCaprio, he has a natural charisma that allows him to connect with people from all walks of life.

**Interests:**

* Environmental activism and sustainability
* Film acting, particularly roles that allow him to explore complex characters and storylines
* Traveling to remote communities and learning about different cultures
* Outdoor activities such as hiking and surfing
* Reading and writing, often incorporating his experiences into his work

**Background:** Ragnar grew up in a family of modest means but instilled with values of compassion and responsibility. He pursued a degree in environmental science before transitioning to acting, where he quickly made a name for himself on the big screen. Throughout his career, he has become increasingly vocal about social causes that resonate with him, using his platform to raise awareness and inspire change.

**Goals:** Ragnar aims to continue using his talent as an actor to highlight pressing issues facing our world. He hopes to collaborate with like-minded individuals on film projects that not only entertain but also educate and empower audiences to take action.
