Here's a summary of the fictional character Ragnar Vuorinen:

Physical Attributes: 
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, a trait inherited from their Finnish heritage
- Hair: Wild mane of curly brown hair that has been unkempt for years due to his love of being outdoors
- Beard: Bushy beard that matches the ruggedness of his hairstyle

Personality:
Ragnar is an adventurous and determined individual who has grown up with a deep connection to nature. He's fiercely loyal to his family and will go to great lengths to protect and care for them. His upbringing in the remote Finnish wilderness has instilled in him a strong sense of survival skills, self-reliance, and an understanding of the natural world.

Interests:
- Hunting and trapping (although he doesn't do it as frequently as his brother Juhani used to)
- Tracking and following the tracks of various creatures
- Exploring the Finnish wilderness and uncovering its secrets
- Reading about ancient spirits and folklore from their father's tales

Given that Ragnar is a skilled outdoorsman, survival expert, and tracker, he has an uncanny ability to navigate through the wilderness with ease. His love for nature and his deep connection to the land have allowed him to develop an intimate understanding of the environment, making him a formidable force when searching for someone or following a trail.

Ragnar's personality is also influenced by his close relationship with his brother Juhani. He has always felt more at home in the wilderness than Juhani did, and this difference in their personalities often led to clashes between the two brothers.
