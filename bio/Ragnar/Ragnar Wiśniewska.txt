Based on the short story provided, here's a summary of Ragnar Wiśniewska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ragnar is a mysterious and stoic individual with a strong sense of determination and justice. He has seen his fair share of battles as a former soldier and has developed a tough exterior to protect himself from the world. However, beneath this façade lies a complex and nuanced personality. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, which drives him to take on cases that the law can't or won't touch. Despite his tough exterior, Ragnar has a strong sense of empathy for those in need, particularly women who are being exploited or marginalized.

**Physical Attributes:** Ragnar stands at around 6'2" with an athletic build, honed from years of military service and hard physical labor. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a thousand stories, as mentioned in the story. The creases on his face map out a lifetime of experiences, giving him a weathered and worn appearance. Ragnar's hair is dark and unkempt, often sticking up in every direction as if he has just rolled out of bed.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Ragnar's interests are centered around solving cases and uncovering the truth. He is fiercely intelligent and analytical, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues to form a coherent picture. He also has a strong interest in people-watching and observing human behavior, which helps him to understand the motivations and actions of his clients. Outside of work, Ragnar's interests are largely solitary pursuits: reading, drinking whiskey, and listening to music that speaks to his troubled past.

It's worth noting that Ragnar's backstory is shrouded in mystery, and much of his life remains a blur. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that he has a deep sense of justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.
