Here is a summary of the fictional character Ragnar Babler's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

He has a sharp wit that allows him to talk his way out of difficult situations, making him a formidable con artist and master thief. His demeanor is often described as low-rumble laughter, which sends shivers down those who hear it. Ragnar is fiercely independent and non-conformist, believing he can live life on his own terms.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a sharp glint that misses nothing
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, unkempt manner

**Interests:** Ragnar is an aficionado of high-stakes heists, carefully planning each move to outsmart his targets. He has a fascination with luxury goods and rare items, which often serve as the focal point for his thieving exploits. Outside of the underworld, Ragnar enjoys whiskey, smoke-filled bars, and the company of old acquaintances like Leon. Despite his rough exterior, he has an appreciation for fine art, music, and the finer things in life.
