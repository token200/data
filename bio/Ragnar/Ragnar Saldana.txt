**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:**

Ragnar Saldana is a master craftsman who is fiercely dedicated to his art. He is intensely focused on his work, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. However, this single-minded dedication has earned him a reputation as one of the finest blacksmiths in the land.

Despite his reserved nature, Ragnar has a deep sense of loyalty and compassion. He takes great care to ensure that every piece he creates is not only functional but also beautiful. His attention to detail is unparalleled, and he will go to great lengths to ensure that his work meets even the highest standards.

Ragnar is also deeply proud of his heritage and his reputation as a master craftsman. He has a strong sense of self-worth, which can sometimes make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who do not know him. However, once you gain his trust, he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to support and protect those he cares about.

**Interests:**

* Blacksmithing and metalwork (naturally!)
* Forging and shaping metal to create beautiful works of art
* Studying the properties of different metals and alloys
* Collecting rare and exotic materials for his craft
* Traveling and learning from other master craftsmen
* Reading and writing about history, particularly the history of blacksmithing and warfare

**Habits:**

* Ragnar is often seen with a hammer in hand, even when he's not working.
* He has a habit of muttering to himself as he works, often whispering phrases or quotes that have been passed down through his family for generations.
* Despite his rugged appearance, Ragnar has a weakness for fine foods and drinks, particularly ale and mead.

Overall, Ragnar Saldana is a complex and multifaceted individual who is driven by his passion for blacksmithing. His dedication to his craft has earned him a reputation as one of the finest master craftsmen in the land, but it also comes at a cost: he often neglects his own well-being in pursuit of perfection.
