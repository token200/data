**Personality:** Ragnar appears to be a resourceful and determined individual. He is accustomed to navigating vast expanses like the Mongol steppes and feels a sense of disconnection in urban environments. This suggests that he values freedom and independence. His wry smile and ability to read people, as evident from his conversation with the taxi driver, imply that he is observant and possibly has a dry sense of humor.

- **Eye Color**: His eye color is not specified in the short story, but considering his background as a man from Mongolia/ Siberia, he might have eyes that reflect the region's cultural diversity, such as brown or possibly green.

**Interests:** Ragnar seems to be deeply interested in historical artifacts and lost knowledge, particularly those related to the Mongol Empire. The whispers of an ancient secret about a golden amulet have drawn him in like a moth to flame. His motivations are somewhat mysterious, but it appears that he is driven by a desire to uncover secrets and understand the universe better through these artifacts. This suggests that his interests lean towards history, archaeology, and possibly mysticism or esoteric knowledge.
