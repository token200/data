**Personality:** Ragnar is a man of few words, but his piercing blue eyes reveal a deep sense of wisdom and experience. He is a natural leader, earning the respect of those around him through his bravery and expertise. However, he remains humble and skeptical of outsiders, having been burned by people seeking to claim the artifact for themselves. As he learns to trust others, particularly Eira, Ragnar's demeanor softens, revealing a kinder, more patient side.

**Physical Attributes:** Ragnar is likely in his late 30s or early 40s, with a rugged, weathered appearance that reflects his years spent surviving on the Norwegian coast. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean, athletic build honed from years of sailing and fighting. His piercing blue eyes are an unmistakable feature, gleaming with intelligence and intensity. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his strong jawline and prominent nose.

**Interests:** Ragnar's passions lie in the study of ancient artifacts and the secrets they hold. He is deeply fascinated by the mysterious runes on the relic he discovered, spending countless hours deciphering their meaning and unlocking their hidden knowledge. As he learns to share this knowledge with others, particularly Eira, Ragnar develops a new passion for mentoring and teaching, finding joy in watching his apprentice grow and thrive.
