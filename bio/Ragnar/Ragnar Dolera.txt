Here is a summary of the fictional character Ragnar Dolera:

**Personality:** Ragnar Dolera is a strong-willed and courageous Viking warrior with an unwavering sense of pride and loyalty. Despite his intimidating demeanor, he possesses a calm exterior that allows him to think strategically in high-pressure situations. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep well of anger and betrayal, which can simmer just below the surface when provoked. His unshakeable determination and refusal to back down make him a formidable opponent in battle.

**Physical Attributes:** Ragnar Dolera stands at an impressive height of 6'5" (196 cm) above his peers, making him an imposing figure on the battlefield. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or alliances. His short, dark hair is often tied back in a simple knot, revealing a strong jawline and prominent cheekbones that accentuate his rugged features. He has a robust build, honed from years of combat and physical labor.

**Interests:** Ragnar Dolera's interests revolve around protecting and leading his clan with honor and pride. As a skilled warrior and strategist, he is deeply invested in the art of warfare and the politics of Viking society. Outside of battle, he enjoys hunting, feasting, and listening to stories of his ancestors' exploits. He is also fiercely devoted to his family, particularly his mother Gudrunn and father Harald, whom he seeks to uphold their legacy through his actions.

While not much is revealed about Ragnar Dolera's personal life or hobbies beyond these interests, it can be inferred that he values loyalty, courage, and strength above all else.
