Ragnar Wolf is a fearless and unyielding warrior with a strong sense of loyalty and duty to his tribe. He has a natural charisma that commands respect from his comrades, and he knows exactly when to unleash his ferocity on the battlefield. Off the field, he is introspective and calculating, weighing every decision carefully before acting.

**Interests:**

Ragnar's greatest passion is battle itself – the clash of steel, the scent of sweat and blood, and the thrill of victory over defeat. He is also deeply interested in strategy and tactics, always seeking ways to improve his own fighting skills and outmaneuver his enemies. Despite this, he has a softer side when it comes to his people and those he cares about; he will stop at nothing to protect them from harm.

When not on the battlefield or engaged in battle preparation, Ragnar enjoys listening to tales of old and studying the great legends of Viking history. He is also known to be quite fond of feasting and drinking with his comrades, enjoying a good ale or horn of mead as much as the next man.

**Quirks:**

Ragnar has a distinctive habit of tapping his shield arm on the ground whenever he's thinking deeply about a strategy or battle plan. This tic becomes almost hypnotic to those around him, allowing them to tap into his own focused energy. He is also known to have a favorite battle cry, "Viking sky!" which he lets out with reckless abandon when charging into combat.

Overall, Ragnar Wolf is a complex and multifaceted individual – a warrior, strategist, leader, and friend – whose presence commands attention and inspires loyalty in all who meet him.
