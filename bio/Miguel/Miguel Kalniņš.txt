Since Miguel Kalniņš is not a real or well-known fictional character, I will create a new character based on your request.

Miguel Kalniņš is a 28-year-old professional soccer player from Riga, Latvia. Physically, he stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build and piercing blue eyes. His dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, textured look that complements his rugged yet charming personality.

As for his interests, Miguel is a passionate individual who balances his love for sports with his love for the arts. When not on the field, he enjoys playing guitar and writing music, inspired by the rich musical heritage of his Latvian roots. He's also an avid traveler, having explored many parts of Europe while competing in international soccer tournaments.

Miguel is known for his infectious enthusiasm and kindness off the field, often using his platform to raise awareness about social issues affecting his community. Despite his fame in the soccer world, he remains humble and down-to-earth, always looking for opportunities to engage with fans and share his story.
