**Physical Attributes:**
Miguel Krūmiņa stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic yet lean build. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his expressive brown eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures while researching a story.

**Personality:**
Miguel is a driven and ambitious individual who is passionate about uncovering the truth and telling stories that need to be told. He is fiercely independent and can come across as introverted at times, but those who know him well understand that he has a quick wit and a sharp intellect that makes him a formidable journalist. Miguel's curiosity is his greatest strength, and he is always eager to explore new places and meet people from different walks of life.

**Interests:**
Miguel is deeply interested in social justice, environmental sustainability, and the impact of technology on society. He is particularly drawn to stories that highlight the struggles faced by marginalized communities and the power of innovation to drive positive change. When he's not working on a story, Miguel enjoys exploring the lesser-known neighborhoods of Riga, trying out new foods at local cafes, and practicing yoga in the city's parks.

In his free time, Miguel is also an avid reader of literature and history, which fuels his curiosity about the complexities of human experience. He has a weakness for old coffee shops, where he can spend hours sipping on espresso and listening to the stories of fellow patrons.
