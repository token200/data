Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Miguel Lundgren:

**Personality:** Miguel is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He has an aura of command that commands attention without seeking it. His presence is calming, yet his voice is low and gravelly, conveying a sense of gravitas. Despite being disillusioned with the system, he possesses a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to see it served.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, worn long and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, hinting at his former life as a detective
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, angular cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Miguel's interests revolve around justice, detection, and helping those in need. He is driven by a desire to see the system change and to hold those who abuse power accountable. His work as a detective is a reflection of this passion, and he finds satisfaction in solving cases that others might dismiss.

Outside of his professional life, Miguel's interests are not well-documented. However, based on his demeanor and background, it can be inferred that he values solitude, introspection, and perhaps even a good book or two. His connection to the world outside his pub office is tenuous at best, suggesting that he is content with keeping to himself and observing the world from a distance.

It's also worth noting that Miguel's past as a member of the Swedish National Police Force has left an indelible mark on him. He carries the scars (both physical and emotional) of his experiences with him, which informs his approach to justice and detection.
