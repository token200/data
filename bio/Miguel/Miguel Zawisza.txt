Here is a summary of Miguel Zawisza's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Miguel Zawisza is a complex and introspective individual. As a former spy, he has developed a strong sense of self-preservation and independence. However, after being manipulated by his handlers for years, he has become driven by a desire for truth and justice. He is fiercely determined and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to challenging situations. Despite his tough exterior, there are hints that Miguel is haunted by memories of his past life as a spy, suggesting that he may also be vulnerable and introspective.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a sharp, intelligent glint
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical activity and espionage training
* Hair: Dark brown, worn short and practical
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (likely obtained during one of his many missions)

**Interests:** Miguel's interests are largely centered around uncovering the truth and bringing justice to those who have wronged him. He is intensely curious about the world and its secrets, often finding himself drawn into complex web of espionage and counter-espionage. Outside of his work, he seems to enjoy simple, quiet activities such as tending to his farm animals or fixing fences - a far cry from the high-stakes missions of his past life.

In terms of hobbies, it's unlikely that Miguel has any leisure time for recreation or personal pursuits. His focus is too intense on uncovering the truth and righting wrongs. However, as he begins to reconnect with his own identity and sense of purpose, we may see him develop new interests and passions - such as writing, reading, or exploring new places - that help him heal and grow as a person.
