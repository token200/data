When not working at the bar or embarking on treasure hunts with Carlos, Miguel enjoys exploring the city's underground art scene, listening to local music, and sipping whiskey at his favorite taverns. These quiet moments allow him to unwind and connect with the world around him in a way that was previously impossible for him.

As he gains confidence and starts to rebuild his life, Miguel becomes fascinated by the idea of building something new â€“ whether it's rebuilding relationships, exploring new places, or finding ways to channel his energies into positive pursuits.
