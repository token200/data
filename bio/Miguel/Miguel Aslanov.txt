Based on the provided story, I have created a summary of the fictional character Miguel Aslanov:

Miguel Aslanov is a brilliant and reclusive scientist who has made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of quantum physics. His physical attributes include being around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing blue eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses that add to his eccentric appearance. He often dresses in worn-out lab coats, which reflect his preference for comfort over fashion.

Miguel's personality is characterized by his intensity and focus on his work, making him appear blunt and dismissive towards those who approach him. However, he also has a spark of curiosity and a desire to share his knowledge with others, as evident in his interactions with Sarah, the young journalist. Despite his reclusive nature, Miguel seems to have a sense of wonder and excitement about his discoveries, which drives him to push the boundaries of scientific understanding.

As for interests, Miguel's passion lies in the study of quantum energy and its potential applications. His work has captured his attention and imagination, and he is constantly seeking ways to explore and understand this complex phenomenon. Outside of his laboratory, it can be assumed that Miguel enjoys solitude, allowing him to focus on his research without distractions. However, his fascination with the mysteries of quantum physics also suggests that he might have a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the natural world.
