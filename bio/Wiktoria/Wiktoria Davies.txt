Here is a summary of Wiktoria Davies' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Wiktoria stands at 5'8" with a slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an intense, piercing green, which seem to sparkle with warmth and kindness behind her bright smile. She has a small tattoo of a pastry brush on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Wiktoria is a complex and multi-faceted individual, with a quick wit and sharp tongue that can be both an asset and a liability. On the surface, she appears to be confident, charismatic, and warm, with a natural ability to connect with people and make them feel at ease. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deeply emotional and vulnerable person who has been hurt in the past and is still learning to trust others. Wiktoria is fiercely independent and determined, with a strong sense of self-preservation that can sometimes make her come across as aloof or guarded.

**Interests:**
Wiktoria's passion for baking and running her own business, Sweet Delights, is matched only by her love of reading and writing. She spends her free time devouring romance novels and writing poetry in her spare moments. Wiktoria also has a deep appreciation for the town of Ravenswood and its quirky residents, which inspired her to start experimenting with local ingredients and flavors at her bakery.

Despite her recent divorce and ongoing healing process, Wiktoria remains optimistic and open-minded, always looking for ways to grow and improve herself as a person. Her strong sense of curiosity and adventure drives her to explore new interests and try new things, whether it's attending writing workshops or exploring the local hiking trails on weekends.
