**Personality:**
Wiktoria D'Annunzio appears to be a confident and commanding individual with a strong sense of self. She has a sharp instinct for detecting trouble and can think on her feet, as evident from her quick action in responding to the emergency at the gala. Her instincts also tell her that Alessandro is not what he seems, suggesting she has a keen ability to read people and situations.

However, Wiktoria's trust in Alessandro is a notable exception to this persona. She feels an inexplicable connection to him, which may indicate that there are more complex facets to her personality than initially apparent.

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height suggests Wiktoria is tall and imposing, likely allowing her to stand out in crowded spaces.
* Eye Color: Hazel or Brown - The story doesn't specify the exact color of her eyes, but hazel or brown would be fitting for someone described as having piercing green eyes (Alessandro's).

**Interests:**
Wiktoria appears to be a highly skilled and trained investigator, likely drawn to solving mysteries and unraveling secrets. Her expertise in the London Detective Agency suggests that she has a strong analytical mind and is adept at piecing together clues.

Outside of her professional life, Wiktoria may have interests in:

* Politics: As a lead investigator for the prestigious agency, she might be interested in staying informed about social and economic issues affecting London's elite.
* History: Her involvement with high-society individuals could lead to an interest in historical events, particularly those connected to the upper class.

It's also possible that Wiktoria has a personal or emotional connection driving her investigation into Alessandro's mysterious past, hinting at a more complex and possibly romantic element to their relationship.
