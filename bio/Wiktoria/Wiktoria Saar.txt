Here is a summary of the fictional character Wiktoria Saar:

**Physical Attributes:**
Wiktoria Saar is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s. She has an unremarkable yet striking appearance, with long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a warmth and kindness, even when she's not smiling. Wiktoria stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which is slightly above average height for a woman.

**Personality:**
Wiktoria Saar is a complex and introspective person who has spent most of her life away from the rural village where her great-grandmother, Elina Saar, settled. As a result, she's developed a sense of wonder and curiosity about her ancestors' lives, which drove her to return to this tiny corner of the world for a family reunion. Wiktoria is fiercely independent, having built a life on her own terms, but she's also deeply rooted in her heritage and willing to listen and learn from others. Her connection with Elina reveals a vulnerable side to Wiktoria, one that she's only recently begun to explore.

**Interests:**
Wiktoria's interests are not explicitly stated in the short story, but based on her connection with Elina and her own life experiences, it can be inferred that she values:

* Family history and heritage
* Connection to her ancestors and cultural roots
* Personal growth, self-discovery, and exploration
* Nurturing relationships, particularly those built around trust and shared stories
* Travel, adventure, and exploring new places (as hinted at by her return to the village)

Overall, Wiktoria Saar is a character with a rich inner life and a deep connection to her family's past. Her journey serves as a reminder that we can always find our roots in unexpected places and that home can be a state of mind.
