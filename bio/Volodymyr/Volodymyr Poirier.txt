Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Volodymyr Poirier:

**Physical Attributes:**
Volodymyr stands at 6'2" with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing blue eyes are striking and seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. His chiseled jawline and strong facial features give him a commanding presence. His dark hair is often unkempt, framing his face in a way that accentuates his angular features.

**Personality:**
Volodymyr is an enigmatic figure with a complex personality. He is introverted and prefers to keep to himself, only speaking when necessary. When he does speak, it's as if the weight of his words carries significant meaning, making him come across as thoughtful and introspective. Despite this reserved nature, Volodymyr is fiercely passionate about his art and will stop at nothing to see his vision through.

**Interests:**
Volodymyr has a deep love for art, particularly street art and urban installations. He finds solace in the raw emotion and unapologetic expression of these forms of art, which resonates deeply with him. Before his transformation, he was also drawn to the high society and wealth associated with his family's business. However, this privilege came at a cost, leaving him feeling suffocated and disconnected from his true self.

After leaving his family's business behind, Volodymyr's interests shifted towards using art as a tool for social change and justice. He is now driven by a desire to uplift marginalized communities and challenge the status quo through his creative expression. As the mysterious 'Blue-Eyed Vandal', he continues to push boundaries and inspire those around him with his powerful message.
