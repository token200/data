She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, giving her an endearing and intelligent appearance.

**Personality:**
Gabriele is a force to be reckoned with - sharp-witted, confident, and fiercely independent. Her years of experience as a detective have honed her instincts to the point where she can read people and situations like a book. She's quick to think on her feet and has an uncanny ability to remain calm under pressure. Despite her tough exterior, Gabriele has a compassionate side, particularly when it comes to family matters. Her determination and resilience make her a true leader in the world of detective work.

She's an avid reader of crime fiction and is known to devour books on psychology, criminology, and forensic science.

Her love for music is also evident - she has a vast collection of vinyl records and often listens to jazz or classical music while she works.

**Additional Details:**
Gabriele's family background seems to be marked by tragedy, as hinted at in the story where it is mentioned that Gabriele had a brother named Alex who was involved in a life of crime. It can also be inferred that her professional success has come at some personal cost, with no mention of any romantic relationships or hobbies outside of work.
