**Interests:**

* Traditional Tuscan music is Gabriele's primary passion. He loves the folk traditions of Italy and aims to preserve and promote these styles through his own music.

* When he's performing or writing, Gabriele tends to get lost in the moment, forgetting about time, space, and everything else except for the music itself.
