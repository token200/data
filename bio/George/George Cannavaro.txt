Despite his success as an artist, he remains intensely private and prefers the company of his art to people. He is fiercely passionate about his craft, and his dedication to it has driven him to create breathtaking works of art that speak to the human experience.

In his free time, George is likely found lost in thought, observing the world around him with a keen eye and a creative mind at work. He might take long walks in nature, studying the play of light and shadow on his subjects, or spend hours in his studio, experimenting with new techniques and materials.

It's worth noting that Sophia's encounter with George left her wondering if he had any interests outside of art. While we can't say for certain, it's possible that George is a bookworm at heart, devouring literature from classical to contemporary authors, or perhaps enjoys playing music on his old piano as a way to clear his mind.

Overall, George Cannavaro is an artist whose true nature lies in the realm of imagination, where creativity knows no bounds and inspiration flows freely.
