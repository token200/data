Here is a summary of George Rousseau's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** George Rousseau is a complex and multifaceted individual with a reputation for being both brilliant and infuriating. He possesses an intellectual ferocity and a passion for his work that drives him to push the boundaries of human psychology. However, this same drive can also lead to mercurial behavior, brutal candor, and a tendency to lash out at those around him. Despite his darker tendencies, George has a charismatic presence that draws people in, making it difficult for others to resist his influence.

**Physical Attributes:** George is approximately 6'1" (185 cm) tall with an athletic build. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, which seems to bore into those he meets. His hair is dark brown and often styled neatly, but when relaxed, it has a hint of unruliness that speaks to his passionate nature.

**Interests:** As a renowned scientist studying human psychology, George's primary interest lies in understanding the intricacies of emotional manipulation. He is deeply fascinated by the ways in which people's emotions can be leveraged to achieve specific outcomes and is driven to unravel the complex dynamics of human emotion. His work has led him to explore various fields, including neuroscience, sociology, and philosophy, as he seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate web of influence that governs human behavior.

While his research may have started with a purely scientific bent, George's interests have evolved into a desire to understand the darker aspects of human nature and how they can be harnessed for personal gain. This has led him down a path of self-discovery, where he grapples with the blurred lines between reality and manipulation, much like his colleague and friend, Dr. Emma Taylor.

Ultimately, George's true passion lies in uncovering the secrets of influence and mastering its use to achieve unparalleled success â€“ even if it means sacrificing a part of himself in the process.
