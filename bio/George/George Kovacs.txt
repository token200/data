Here's a summary of the fictional character George Kovacs:

**Physical Attributes:**
George Kovacs is a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-40s. He stands at approximately 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a sturdy build that speaks to his love of manual labor and tinkering. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his rough-around-the-edges charm. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seems almost unnerving given the intensity of their emotional depth. A smattering of stubble covers his cheeks and chin, adding to his rugged appearance.

**Personality:**
George Kovacs is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a heart of gold. Despite his rough exterior, he has a deep empathy for others and a willingness to lend a helping hand whenever needed. He's fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but beneath this tough exterior lies a deeply emotional person with a strong sense of loyalty and justice.

**Interests:**
George Kovacs is passionate about fixing things - whether it's old cars, broken machinery, or even the broken dreams of others. He finds solace in the hands-on work of repair and restoration, often losing himself in the intricate details of his projects. When he's not working on a new car or tinkering with an engine, George can be found reading about history, philosophy, or science fiction - anything that sparks his imagination or challenges his worldview.

**Other Details:**
George Kovacs grew up in a humble household, where his love of fixing things was encouraged by his resourceful mother. As he grew older, he honed his skills as a mechanic and began working on cars and machinery to make ends meet. Despite his successes, George struggled with feelings of isolation and disconnection, stemming from his complicated relationship with his estranged father. However, with Istv√°n's visit, George begins to rebuild his life and rediscover the joy in fixing not just things, but also people.
