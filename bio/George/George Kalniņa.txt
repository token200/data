Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of the fictional character George Kalniņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** George Kalniņa appears to be a complex individual with a mix of introverted and extroverted traits. On the one hand, he values secrecy and anonymity, which suggests that he is private and cautious by nature. However, as revealed through his interactions with villagers, he also seems to have a dry sense of humor and can adapt to new situations, such as transitioning from espionage to baking.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no mention of George's physical attributes in the provided story, except for his profession as a baker, which implies that he has some experience working with hands and possibly some manual dexterity. However, I can make an educated guess based on the story:

* Height: Average or slightly above-average height, given that George seems to blend in with the villagers without drawing attention to himself.
* Eye Color: Dark blue or gray eyes, which are common among people of Eastern European descent and would complement his rugged yet mysterious persona.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned baker, George's interests seem to have shifted from high-stakes espionage to more mundane pursuits. However, it is clear that he still enjoys the thrill of working with his hands and creating something delicious for others:

* Baking: George appears to take great pleasure in mixing, kneading, and baking traditional Latvian pastries and bread. He has a deep understanding of the craft and can produce high-quality products.
* Tradition and Culture: As a former Soviet citizen living in post-Soviet Latvia, George may have a strong connection to his cultural heritage. He seems to appreciate the importance of preserving traditional practices and recipes.

It is worth noting that these details are not explicitly stated in the original story but can be inferred from the context and George's actions throughout the narrative.
