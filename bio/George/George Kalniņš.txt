Based on the story about Latvian professional footballer Georgs Kalniņš, here is a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Georgs appears to be a determined and focused individual who has always prioritized his passion for football above all else. He is described as having "a mix of nerves and excitement" before the big match, indicating that he is likely a high-strung person with a strong competitive spirit. As captain of the team, he also shows leadership qualities, inspiring others to chase their own dreams.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific physical attributes are mentioned in the story. However, based on Georgs' profession as a footballer, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) - a typical height for most professional footballers.
* Eye Color: Blue or Green - both colors are commonly associated with Scandinavian and Baltic countries, where Latvia is located.

**Interests:** It's safe to assume that Georgs' primary interest is football. The story highlights his dedication to the sport from a young age, as well as his desire to lead his country to victory in the European Championship final. However, it's possible that he also enjoys spending time with family and friends, perhaps watching football matches or participating in recreational activities together.
