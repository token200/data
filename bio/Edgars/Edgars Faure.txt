Based on the short story inspiration, here is a summary of Edgars Faure's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep blue with a hint of grey, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often neatly combed over his forehead in a manner that adds to his enigmatic appearance

**Personality:**
Edgars Faure is a complex individual with multiple layers. On the surface, he appears to be a reserved and professional historian, skilled in unearthing long-forgotten tales of Latvia's past. However, beneath this façade lies a man driven by a deep sense of curiosity and a penchant for deception – both as a historian and an accomplished thief.

He is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to navigate the dark underbelly of Riga's art world with ease. Edgars has an uncanny ability to think on his feet, making quick decisions that often put him at odds with those around him.

Despite his tough exterior, there is a hint of vulnerability beneath the surface. His life of thievery and deception takes its toll, leaving emotional scars that he may never fully confront.

**Interests:**
Edgars' primary interest lies in unearthing the hidden stories of Latvia's turbulent past. He has an insatiable thirst for knowledge and is often drawn to dusty archives and crumbling libraries, where he pores over yellowed documents and faded photographs.

As a thief, Edgars targets rare artifacts that hold historical significance, particularly those with the potential to fetch handsome sums on the black market. His work as a forger allows him to create convincing replicas of these items, making it difficult for anyone to distinguish between fact and fiction.

In his later life, after choosing integrity over profit, Edgars' interests shift towards using his skills for good. He becomes involved in various charitable causes, working to protect cultural heritage sites from those who would seek to exploit them for personal gain.

The mystery surrounding Edgars Faure remains a subject of intrigue – not because he continues down the path of deception and thievery, but because he has found redemption and courage in his later years.
