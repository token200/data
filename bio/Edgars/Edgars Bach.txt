Despite his past experiences, he has built walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close to him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - Edgars stands tall, with an air of quiet confidence.
* Eye Color: Hazel - His eyes are a deep, rich brown that seems to hold secrets and stories within them.
* Facial Features: Wispy beard, worn leather boots, and a faint scar above his left eyebrow. He has a weathered face, as if the elements have etched their own story onto it.

**Interests:** Music is Edgars' primary passion. As a former composer, he is deeply connected to the world of sound and melody. His love for music is both therapeutic and cathartic, allowing him to express emotions that lie beneath his reserved exterior.

In Sofia's presence, Edgars rediscovered a part of himself that had been dormant for years - the ability to connect with others on a deeper level. His love for music now extends beyond his own creative endeavors, as he begins to compose melodies specifically for her, blurring the lines between reality and myth.
