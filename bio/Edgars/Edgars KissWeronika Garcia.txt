Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Edgars KissWeronika Garcia. Please note that this is purely imaginative and not based on any real individual.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm hazel with golden flecks
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey look
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a subtle scattering of freckles across the nose and cheeks

**Personality:**

* Edgars is a creative and introspective individual, often lost in thought as he navigates the world around him.
* He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or irreverent at times, but this is usually a defense mechanism to hide his true emotions.
* Despite his reserved nature, Edgars has a deep empathy for others and is always willing to lend a listening ear or offer words of encouragement when needed.
* He is fiercely independent and values his alone time, but also has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of his way to help those he cares about.

**Interests:**

* Edgars is passionate about photography and spends much of his free time behind the lens, capturing the beauty in everyday moments.
* He is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and science fiction.
* Music plays a significant role in his life, with a particular fondness for indie folk and acoustic guitar-driven melodies.
* Edgars has a hidden talent for poetry and enjoys writing verse when the mood strikes him.

Please note that these attributes are purely fictional and not based on any real individual. If you have any specific questions or would like me to elaborate on any aspect of this character profile, feel free to ask!
