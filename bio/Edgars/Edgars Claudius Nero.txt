Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Edgars Claudius Nero's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Edgars Claudius Nero is a complex individual with an imposing facade. He appears to be a confident and powerful figure, but beneath his surface lies a web of emotions that are vulnerable to being exposed. He has a dry sense of humor and can be cunning, as seen in his ability to play the part of an affronted nobleman. However, he also shows a human side, particularly when interacting with Emilia Thompson, where he becomes unsettled by her persistence but also impressed by her conviction.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Edgars stands at around 6'2" (188 cm), indicating a tall and imposing figure.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown, which complements his dark hair and aristocratic features.
* Hair Color: His hair is dark brown, possibly with subtle hints of auburn, which adds to his dignified appearance.
* Face Shape: Edgars has a strong, chiseled face with sharp cheekbones, a prominent nose, and full lips that curve into a subtle smile.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Edgars is deeply invested in his business ventures, particularly the Ravenswood Mining Corporation. He values wealth and power above all else and has spent decades building his reputation as the Duke of Ravenswood. However, he also seems to be drawn to intellectual pursuits, such as reading dusty tomes and engaging in conversations about politics and finance.

In contrast, Emilia Thompson's interests are not explicitly stated, but her presence in Edgars' life suggests that she may be investigating the darker aspects of his business dealings and uncovering hidden truths. This could indicate that Edgars is drawn to those who challenge him or push him out of his comfort zone, as seen in his attraction to Emilia despite her initial intentions being adversarial.

It's worth noting that Edgars' personality and interests may be influenced by the pressures of his social status and the expectations placed upon him. As a member of the aristocracy, he has always been held up to high standards, which may have contributed to his tendency to keep people at arm's length or project an image that hides his true emotions.
