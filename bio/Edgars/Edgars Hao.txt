Based on the short story, here is a summary of Edgars Hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Edgars Hao is an enigmatic figure with a mind that defies explanation. He is described as a "reclusive genius" who lives on the fringes of society. He appears to be tight-lipped and non-conformist, revealing little to those who approach him. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be unnervingly direct when speaking with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Edgars Hao is not described in great detail, but it is mentioned that his piercing green eyes seem to bore into Maya's very soul when they first meet. It is also implied that he has undergone significant physical transformations during their encounter, shifting from human form to something more metallic and fluid.

**Height and Eye Color:** Unfortunately, Edgars Hao's height and eye color are not specified in the short story.

**Interests:** While Edgars Hao's interests are not explicitly stated, his transformation into a being with multiple forms suggests that he may be fascinated by the boundaries between different states of existence. He may also have an interest in exploring the nature of reality and challenging conventional understanding. His statement to Maya that "perhaps, just perhaps, it matters little" implies that he values knowledge and truth above personal identity or recognition.

It's worth noting that Edgars Hao's true nature and motivations are left unclear in the short story, leaving room for interpretation about his interests and personality.
