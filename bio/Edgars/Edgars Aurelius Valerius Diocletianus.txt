**Physical Attributes:** Edgars stands at an imposing height of 6 feet 5 inches (196 cm), with a robust physique honed from years of martial training and battle-hardened campaigns. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or alliances. A strong jawline, prominent nose, and chiseled features complete his aristocratic countenance.

**Personality:** Edgars is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, he exudes confidence, courage, and strategic brilliance. He is a natural leader, feared by his enemies and respected by his allies. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a kind and humble heart. Edgars values fairness, wisdom, and loyalty above all else, making him a just ruler beloved by his people.

**Interests:** As a warrior, strategist, and leader, Edgars has always been drawn to activities that challenge his mind and body. He is an avid student of history, diplomacy, and politics, always seeking to improve himself and expand his knowledge. When not serving as the emperor's trusted advisor or leading armies into battle, Edgars enjoys spending time with family and friends, listening to stories from ancient heroes, and reflecting on his life and legacy.

**Additional Details:** Given his noble lineage and powerful connections, Edgars is well-versed in classical languages (Latin, Greek, and some Sumerian), skilled in military tactics, and familiar with the art of chivalry. He is a member of the Roman Senate's exclusive Council of Nine and has earned numerous awards for his bravery and strategic prowess.
