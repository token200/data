Based on the inspiration from Mario Vargas Llosa's life and works, I've created a fictional character profile for Edgars Vargas Llosa:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown with a hint of golden warmth, reminiscent of the Peruvian sun
* Hair: Thick, dark hair that falls to his shoulders, often worn in a loose, tousled style
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, reflecting Edgars' mixed heritage (his father was Peruvian, while his mother was from Spain)
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, a strong jawline, and piercing eyes that seem to hold a deep wisdom

**Personality:**

* Quiet and introspective, with a dry sense of humor that only reveals itself when he's comfortable around others
* Passionate about literature and the arts, with an unshakeable conviction in the power of storytelling to shape reality
* Loyal to those he cares about, but not afraid to challenge those he disagrees with or holds dear
* Guarded, perhaps, due to a history of navigating complex family dynamics and societal expectations

**Interests:**

* Reading and writing, particularly focusing on magical realism and exploring the intersection of politics and personal identity
* Music, especially traditional Peruvian folk music that speaks to his cultural heritage
* Philosophy and psychology, with an interest in the human condition and the search for meaning in a chaotic world
* History, with a particular focus on Peru's turbulent past and its ongoing impact on contemporary society

**Background:**

* Edgars grew up in Lima, Peru, surrounded by the city's vibrant cultural scene and the legacy of his famous father.
* He studied literature at a prestigious university, where he honed his writing skills and developed a deep love for the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa.
* His own writing often explores themes of identity, culture, and power struggles in Peruvian society, reflecting his own experiences growing up amidst social change and upheaval.

While this profile is inspired by the life and works of Mario Vargas Llosa, it's essential to note that Edgars Vargas Llosa is a fictional character, created for the purposes of this summary.
