Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Eduard Nilsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eduard Nilsson is a man of mystery with an air of intrigue surrounding him. He seems introspective and thoughtful, often lost in his own thoughts as he ponders complex cases. Despite this reserved nature, he has a strong sense of gratitude and appreciation for those who help him solve cases, particularly Sofia Rodriguez. His confidence grows when working with Sofia, indicating a strong partnership and mutual respect between them.

**Physical Attributes:** Eduard Nilsson is described as being in his prime (the story doesn't explicitly state age), but no other physical attributes are mentioned besides one crucial detail: he puffs on a pipe. This suggests that he has a bit of an old-world charm, or at least an eccentric interest outside the realm of detective work.

As for height and eye color, I will make an educated guess:

* **Height:** Given the fact that Eduard is described as sitting in his armchair with a steaming cup of coffee on the couch, I'd imagine him to be a bit above average in height. Let's say he stands at around 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall.
* **Eye Color:** His eye color is not specified, but given the calm and collected demeanor depicted in the story, I would assume his eyes are dark, with a shade ranging from navy blue to brown.

**Interests:**

1. **Solving complex cases**: Eduard Nilsson's greatest passion lies in unraveling mysteries and cracking cases that baffle others.
2. **Cryptology and codes**: As an expert detective, he is fascinated by deciphering hidden messages and uncovering secret societies.
3. **Smoking pipes**: Despite the somewhat old-fashioned nature of this hobby, Eduard enjoys puffing on his pipe as a calming activity.

Overall, Eduard Nilsson's personality is shaped by his dedication to solving cases and understanding human behavior, while his interests include cryptography, code-breaking, and enjoying an occasional smoke from his pipe.
