**Personality:**
Eduard Salvini is a complex and introspective person. He's deeply passionate about music, but his journey has taken him from being an artist to becoming a professional performer. This has led to a sense of disconnection from his artistic roots. Despite this, he's driven by a desire to rediscover his love for music and connect with the true essence of it.

He's haunted by feelings of emptiness and loss after losing touch with his artistic self in pursuit of fame. However, with the passing of his father and the discovery of an unfinished symphony, Eduard has finally found the motivation he needed to reclaim his artistic voice.

**Interests:**
Eduard Salvini is primarily interested in music. As a child, he grew up playing the violin on the streets, which eventually led him to become one of Europe's finest violinists. His experience with Tchaikovsky and Brahms is reflected in his appreciation for classical music.

He begins to understand this upon meeting the agent who knows about his father's unfinished symphony and invites him to play the final composition as a tribute to his father.

The story highlights Eduard's search for meaning beyond fame, pointing towards an artistic expression rooted in connection and passion rather than just technical skill.
