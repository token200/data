Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Eduard Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Emperor Diocletianus appears to be a confident, assertive leader who values stability and order above all else. He is willing to challenge conventional wisdom and make unpopular decisions in pursuit of his vision for Rome's future. Despite this, he also shows a more introspective side, as hinted at by the whispered thought that "perhaps one day, I shall reconsider." This suggests that Diocletianus may be open to revising his views on certain matters.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** Approximately 5'10" (178 cm) - Based on average Roman male height during the 4th century AD.
- **Eye Color:** Piercing blue, as described in the story.
- **Hair Color:** Unknown, but possibly dark brown or blonde, given his association with the philosopher Hypatia.

**Interests:**

- **Philosophy and Politics:** Diocletianus is deeply interested in philosophy, particularly mathematics and the natural world. He also has a keen understanding of politics and governance.
- **Religion and Spirituality:** Although he is depicted as supporting a pantheon of deities (Apollo, Sol, and Diana), his views on these matters are not entirely clear-cut. He is open to suggestions from others, as seen in his discussion with Hypatia about the potential for a universal faith.

Overall, Diocletianus seems like a complex figure who balances confidence and assertiveness with introspection and an openness to new ideas.
