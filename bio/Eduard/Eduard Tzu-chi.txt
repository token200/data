Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Eduard Tzu-chi:

**Personality:** Eduard Tzu-chi appears to be an enigmatic and introspective individual. Their calm demeanor during performances suggests a deep connection with their art, while their ability to leave onlookers "agog with wonder" implies a sense of mystique and otherworldliness. However, when approached by Ling, Eduard's response is evasive, hinting at a more guarded or private nature.

**Physical Attributes:** The story doesn't provide a detailed description of Eduard's physical appearance, but it can be inferred that they possess a slender yet athletic build, as evidenced by their fluid and seemingly weightless movements during the performance. Their height is not specified, but given their ethereal presence on stage, it's likely that they are above average height.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, Eduard's eye color is not mentioned in the story.

**Interests:** As a master of Chen-style Taiji, Eduard Tzu-chi is deeply dedicated to their art. Their performance at the exclusive private event suggests that they are passionate about sharing this ancient discipline with others, while also maintaining an air of mystery and exclusivity around themselves. The small tattoo on their hand implies that there may be more to their interests than just Chen-style Taiji â€“ perhaps a deeper connection to the language and symbols depicted in the tattoo.

Overall, Eduard Tzu-chi seems to be a complex and multifaceted individual with an enigmatic presence, both on and off stage.
