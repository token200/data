Here is a summary of Álvaro Liebad's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Álvaro Liebad is a man of quiet confidence and mystery. He has an air of command that draws attention without demanding it, which earned him the nickname "The Shadow" among his peers. Despite this, he remains haunted by feelings of being an outsider, never quite fitting in with those around him. This sense of isolation drives him to seek out new experiences and connections, such as joining The Syndicate.

**Physical Attributes:** Álvaro Liebad stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, which is above the average height for a male of his age group. His eye color is an intense, piercing blue that seems almost unnerving to those who meet him. His hair is dark brown and often styled neatly, framing his chiseled features.

**Interests:** Álvaro Liebad has a deep fascination with art history, architecture, and the concept of possession - both physical and intangible. As a child, he spent hours studying books on these subjects, developing a keen eye for detail that would later serve him well in his line of work. He also has an insatiable curiosity about the world around him, which drives his desire to uncover hidden treasures and secrets.

Additionally, Álvaro Liebad is deeply interested in understanding human emotions and behavior, often finding himself drawn to those who possess a certain "edge" or depth that sets them apart from others. This aspect of his personality is closely tied to his desire for connection and belonging, which he hopes will be fulfilled through his membership in The Syndicate.

It's worth noting that Álvaro Liebad's interests and values are not necessarily altruistic; they are driven by a sense of thrill-seeking and a desire for power and recognition. However, as he navigates this new chapter in his life, it remains to be seen whether these motivations will lead him down a path of redemption or further entanglement with darkness.
