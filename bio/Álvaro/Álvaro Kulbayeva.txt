**Interests:** Álvaro is deeply interested in the culture and history of Kazakhstan, particularly its nomadic tribes and Soviet-era propaganda posters. He draws inspiration from the vast deserts, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins of Central Asia, which he portrays in his vibrant and swirling paintings.
