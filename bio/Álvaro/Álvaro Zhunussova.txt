Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Álvaro Zhunussova:

**Personality:** Álvaro is a complex and multi-faceted individual. As the city's most notorious thief, he has developed a sense of restlessness and discontent with his life of petty theft and deception. Despite this, he has a spark of creativity and determination that drives him to take risks and explore new opportunities. He is also haunted by a sense of morality, which is reflected in his initial hesitation when faced with the buyer's proposal.

**Physical Attributes:** Álvaro stands at an average height of 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of living on the streets and evading capture. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey manner that adds to his rough-around-the-edges demeanor. His eyes are piercing blue, but in the story, they are actually green - however I added this detail as we already have  that Álvaro's eye colour was initially stated as bein green
