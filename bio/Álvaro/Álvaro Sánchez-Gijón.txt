Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, I have created a fictional character profile for Álvaro Sánchez-Gijón:

**Name:** Álvaro Sánchez-Gijón

**Height:** 6'1" (185 cm)

**Eye Color:** Piercing blue-green, an unusual shade that seems to bore into those he looks at.

**Physical Attributes:** Álvaro has an angular face with sharp cheekbones and a strong jawline. His dark hair is often unkempt, framing his intense features. He has a collection of tattoos on his arms and torso, depicting symbols from Spanish folklore and mythological creatures that reflect his fascination with the darker aspects of human nature.

**Personality:** Álvaro is a complex and introspective individual, driven by a fierce passion for social justice and a desire to expose the hidden truths of oppression. He is intensely focused on his work, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. His artistic vision is unyielding, and he is willing to push boundaries and challenge societal norms in order to convey his message. Despite his dark and twisted subject matter, Álvaro has a dry sense of humor and can be charming when he wants to be.

**Interests:** Álvaro is an avid reader of literature and philosophy, particularly the works of Spanish existentialists like Camus and Lorca. He is also fascinated by photography, film, and art history, often incorporating these mediums into his own creative process. In his free time, Álvaro enjoys attending underground art events, attending protests and demonstrations for social justice causes, and engaging in heated debates with fellow artists about the role of creativity in challenging societal norms.

**Quirks:** Álvaro has a habit of muttering to himself when he's deep in thought or experimenting with new ideas. He is also a compulsive collector of artifacts related to marginalized communities, often incorporating them into his artwork as a way of honoring their stories and struggles. Despite his intense focus on his work, Álvaro is a bit of a night owl and can often be found working late into the night, fueled by coffee and determination.

Overall, Álvaro Sánchez-Gijón is a complex and multifaceted individual, driven by a fierce passion for social justice and a desire to use his art as a tool for change.
