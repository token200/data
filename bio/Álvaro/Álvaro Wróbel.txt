Here is a summary of Álvaro Wróbel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Álvaro stands at around 6'1" with a lean yet athletic build. His dark hair is always slightly mussed, framing his face with an air of ruggedness. His piercing eyes gleam with a hint of mischief, often suggesting that he's hiding something behind them. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his escapades as a spy.

**Personality:** Álvaro is a charismatic and resourceful individual with a dry sense of humor. As a former member of the Polish intelligence agency, SZSZ (Biuro Wywiadu), he has honed his skills in espionage, surveillance, and manipulation. However, after leaving the agency, he's found himself struggling to find a new purpose in life. Álvaro is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else, but beneath his tough exterior lies a complex web of emotions and motivations.

**Interests:** Álvaro has a passion for unraveling mysteries and solving puzzles. As a former spy, he's developed an exceptional talent for observation, deduction, and strategic thinking. He's always been drawn to the unknown and the unexplained, often finding himself at the center of eerie events. When not working on a new case, Álvaro enjoys sipping fine whiskey, watching old movies, and exploring abandoned places – much like the textile factory he visited in the story.

In addition to his love for mystery-solving, Álvaro is also deeply invested in uncovering hidden truths about Kasia's family legacy. He's been drawn to her father's mysterious past, which seems to be connected to an old war-time event. Álvaro is now on a quest to unravel the tangled threads of history and bring closure to Kasia, while also finding his own purpose once again.

It's worth noting that Álvaro's experiences as a spy have left emotional scars, making him guarded around those he trusts. He often struggles with feelings of guilt, regret, and isolation, which can manifest in dry humor or aloofness around others. Despite this, there's an underlying warmth to his personality, waiting to be revealed when the time is right.
