In his quieter moments, Alejandro María enjoys writing for himself rather than just for publication. This creative renaissance sparks a passion within him to tell stories that matter, not just for the headlines but for the sake of being heard by someone who needs to know the truth.

Alejandro's love for storytelling is further fueled by his desire to connect with others on a deeper level.
