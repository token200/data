Based on the short story, here is a summary of Alejandro Szymanski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alejandro appears to be a man with a mysterious past who has built an invisible shield around his heart to protect himself from getting hurt. Despite this, he is curious and open to forming connections with others. He seems introspective and thoughtful, often lost in his own thoughts as he observes the world around him.

However, as we see throughout his encounter with Sophia, Alejandro has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, evident in his response to Sophia's question about what it's like being him. This suggests that beneath his guarded exterior, he may have a more vulnerable and introspective side.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown or black, with an unkempt and slightly messy texture

It's not explicitly stated in the story what Alejandro's hair color is, but based on his description as having "dark eyes," it's likely that his hair is dark to match.

**Interests:** Based on Alejandro's behavior during his encounter with Sophia, it appears that he may be interested in:

* Music: Alejandro seems to appreciate the atmosphere of a caf√© and notices the woman playing music or singing in the background.
* Poetry: Sophia is an aspiring artist who expresses herself through poetry, which sparks Alejandro's interest.

Overall, Alejandro Szymanski seems to be a complex individual with a rich inner life, shaped by his experiences on the streets. Despite his rough exterior, he has a deep desire for connection and understanding, which Sophia's presence in his life helps him to tap into.
