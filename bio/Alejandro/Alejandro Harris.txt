Here is a summary of Alejandro Harris's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Alejandro is a retired detective who has seen his fair share of darkness and despair. He appears to be a man haunted by his past experiences, with a deep-seated wariness and unease that lingers even after he's left the detective business behind. Despite this, he still possesses a strong sense of justice and duty, as evident from his willingness to take on new cases despite his reservations.

**Physical Attributes:** Alejandro is a rugged-looking man in his later years, with "tired lines etched on his face" suggesting a life of stress and hardship. His height is not specified, but he appears sturdy enough to have had an athletic build at some point in his life. His eye color is brown, likely deep and intense given the wariness in his eyes.

**Interests:** Alejandro seems to be a man of few interests outside of his work as a detective. He surrounds himself with dusty books and faded photographs, suggesting a fondness for history and nostalgia. However, it's also possible that he uses these trappings as a way to distance himself from the past and cope with the memories that linger. His love of leather jackets and his connection to an elite unit suggest that he has a certain affinity for action and adrenaline, but this appears to be secondary to his desire for peace and quiet.

It's worth noting that Alejandro's personality and interests are likely shaped by his experiences as a detective, including his involvement in cases like the one described in the short story. His past traumas have left him with emotional scars, and he may struggle to find closure or move on from these memories.
