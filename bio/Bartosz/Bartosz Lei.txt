Here is a summary of the fictional character Bartosz Lei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bartosz Lei appears to be a free-spirited individual with a passion for discovery. He is not afraid to take risks and push boundaries, as evident from his willingness to handle the notorious Devil's Thorne without proper precautions. Despite this recklessness, he also shows signs of introspection and a desire for knowledge, as reflected in his study of botany and his ability to decipher ancient secrets. His confidence and charisma are apparent when interacting with others, such as Kiet, whom he commands respect.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel

Bartosz Lei is described as having an average build but a distinctive presence that suggests a sense of calm authority. His physical features are not overly striking, but his eyes - a piercing hazel - hold a depth and intensity that hints at his intellect.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Bartosz's primary interest lies in botany, particularly the study of rare and unusual plant species. This passion is fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the natural world and its secrets. His encounter with the Devil's Thorne seems to have opened doors not only to hidden knowledge but also to new perspectives on reality itself.

In addition to botany, it can be inferred that Bartosz has a broad interest in the study of ancient civilizations and their lore. His experience unlocking "forbidden secrets" from the visions induced by the Devil's Thorne suggests an affinity for mysticism, esotericism, or other fringe areas of knowledge that challenge mainstream understanding.

These attributes suggest that Bartosz Lei is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality - simultaneously reckless and perceptive, driven and intuitive.
