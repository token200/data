Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Bartosz Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus:

**Personality:**
Bartosz Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus is a cunning and determined individual who has risen to power through his own efforts. He is a just and fair ruler, but also fiercely intelligent and calculating, able to navigate the complexities of politics with ease. Despite his impressive stature, he appears introspective and observant, often lost in thought as he surveys his empire.

**Physical Attributes:**
Diocletianus stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a strong and imposing presence. His piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. He has dark hair that is often worn neatly trimmed, framing his angular face and emphasizing his sharp jawline. His features are chiseled and refined, giving him an air of regal authority.

**Interests:**
As a ruler, Diocletianus's primary interest lies in expanding and securing his empire through strategic conquests. He is driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy and ensure the stability of his realm. However, he also appears to be deeply invested in understanding the cultures and customs of the various provinces under his rule, often engaging with local leaders and officials to gather intelligence and build alliances.

It's worth noting that while Diocletianus is portrayed as intelligent and calculating, there are hints throughout the story that suggest a more nuanced side to his personality. He is willing to listen to dissenting voices and consider alternative perspectives, particularly in the case of Lucius and the rebellion in the Eastern provinces. This suggests that he may be capable of growth, empathy, and compassion beneath his authoritarian exterior.
