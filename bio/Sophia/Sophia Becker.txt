Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Sophia Becker's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sophia appears to be a introspective and emotional person. She has experienced significant loss in her past year, particularly the death of her husband Jack, which has left her feeling shattered. However, as she spends time in nature, she begins to find solace and a sense of peace. This suggests that Sophia is someone who values connection with nature and perhaps finds it therapeutic for her emotional well-being.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no explicit details about Sophia's physical attributes mentioned in the story, such as height or eye color. However, based on the context and the fact that she can climb to the edge of a rocky terrain like the Grand Canyon, I would imagine that Sophia is likely physically fit and possibly athletic.

**Interests:** Sophia seems to have a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors. She has spent many happy moments with her husband Jack exploring the Grand Canyon, hiking, picnicking, stargazing, and relaxing by the river. It's clear that she values these experiences and finds joy in being surrounded by the beauty of nature.

It's also worth noting that Sophia seems to be someone who is deeply affected by emotions and is not afraid to show vulnerability or ask for help. Her nickname with Alex suggests a close friendship and a level of comfort with each other, which could indicate that she values meaningful relationships as well.
