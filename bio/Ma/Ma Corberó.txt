**Physical Attributes:**
Ma Corberó stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and falls in loose waves down her back, framing her heart-shaped face.

She has a small tattoo of a sea shell on her left wrist and often wears a delicate silver necklace adorned with a tiny crystal pendant.

**Personality:**
Ma Corberó is a deeply mystical and introspective person, with a strong connection to the natural world and its rhythms. She possesses an air of quiet confidence and authority, as if she has spent years mastering the secrets of the universe. Her eyes seem to hold a deep understanding and empathy, allowing her to see beyond the surface level of things. Despite this, she is also a listener, preferring to observe and guide rather than dominate or dictate.

**Interests:**
Ma Corberó is deeply passionate about weaving, which serves as a metaphor for her connection to the cosmos and the secrets it holds. She sees the loom as a tool for creating not just fabric, but destinies themselves. Her interests also include:

* The study of ancient cultures and traditions
* The observation of natural patterns and cycles
* The exploration of the human psyche and its connections to the universe
* The practice of meditation and introspection

In her free time, Ma Corberó often sits by the loom, watching the threads come alive in the soft light of dawn. She is also known to take long walks along the beach at night, when the stars are most vivid and the sea creatures are most active.
