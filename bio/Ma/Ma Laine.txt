Her hair is dark brown and often tied back in a loose braid, framing her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are pools of deep, rich brown that seem to hold a world of emotion and knowledge within them. She has a slender yet athletic build, a testament to her active lifestyle spent tending to the land and weaving stories under the stars.
