Her eyes are an unnerving shade of indigo, which seem to bore into those she looks at, as if seeing right through them. Her hair is a wild tangle of silver-blonde locks, often tied back in a loose bun that frames her face. Her skin has a warm, earthy undertone, like the rich soil of the forest floor.

**Personality:** Ma Kask is a woman of great power and wisdom, with an air of quiet authority that commands respect. Her voice is low and husky, with a hint of a growl that makes it impossible to ignore when she speaks. Despite her enigmatic nature, she exudes a sense of warmth and kindness, particularly towards those who prove worthy of her trust. She has a wicked sense of humor and can be playful in her interactions, but make no mistake – she is always in control.

**Interests:** Ma Kask's interests are multifaceted and rooted in her connection to the natural world. As a healer, she has a deep understanding of herbs and potions, which she uses to craft remedies that have a profound impact on those who suffer from illness or injury. She is also an accomplished herbalist, able to identify even the rarest plants and use them to create potent elixirs. Beyond her practical pursuits, Ma Kask is attuned to the rhythms of nature, sensing changes in the weather, the phases of the moon, and the whispers of the forest itself.

**Other:** While we do not have explicit information on Ma Kask's past or motivations, it is clear that she is a guardian of sorts – watching over Ashwood village with a fierce protective instinct. Her task for Eira was designed to test her mettle, but ultimately proved to be an opportunity for growth and understanding.
