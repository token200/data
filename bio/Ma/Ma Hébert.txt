I'm happy to help you create a fictional character profile for Ma Hébert! Since there's no existing information on her, let's get started from scratch.

**Physical Attributes:**
Ma Hébert is a 5'8" (173 cm) tall woman with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy bob that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to sparkle with curiosity. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her left wrist, which she obtained during a spontaneous trip to the Caribbean.

**Personality:**
Ma Hébert is a free-spirited and adventurous individual who lives life on her own terms. She's fiercely independent and values her autonomy above all else. Her quick wit and sharp tongue often get her into trouble, but she's also not afraid to apologize and make amends when necessary. Ma Hébert has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her. However, once you gain her trust, she'll reveal a warm and empathetic side that's hard to resist.

**Interests:**
Ma Hébert is passionate about photography, hiking, and writing. She loves capturing the beauty of the world through her camera lens and exploring new outdoor locations to find inspiration for her art. When she's not snapping photos or lugging her backpack, Ma Hébert can often be found scribbling in her journal or working on a short story. Music is also a significant part of her life – she plays the guitar and loves listening to indie folk and singer-songwriters.

Now that we have Ma Hébert's character profile, I'd love to start creating a story around her! What kind of tale would you like me to spin?
