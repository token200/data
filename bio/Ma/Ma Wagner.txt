**Personality:**

Ma Wagner is an intensely private individual who has learned to rely only on himself after years of loss and loneliness. Despite this, he has a deep-seated need for connection and purpose. Ma's guarded nature stems from past experiences where those around him were taken advantage of by his powers or tried to exploit him. He walks a fine line between light and darkness, always on the lookout for those who might seek to manipulate or use him.

Despite this caution, when Ma finds someone with whom he can form genuine connections and trust, like Maya, he is fiercely loyal and protective. His personality has layers, revealing both strength and vulnerability beneath his tough exterior.

**Interests:**

- Fire manipulation - Ma's powers allow him to interact with fire in unique ways. He controls it with precision and fury.
- Protecting the innocent - This is a key driving force for Ma, especially since his early years marked by tragedy and loss led him to focus on fighting fires and saving lives.
- Keeping himself hidden from the world - Due to past traumas, he maintains multiple identities to avoid drawing attention or forming attachments that could put those close to him at risk.

These interests reflect both his strengths as a guardian of fire and the motivations behind his mysterious lifestyle.
