Since Ester Saldaña is not a fictional character, but rather a Mexican politician and former mayor of Coahuila, I will create a fictional character inspired by her.

Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Ester Saldana:

**Personality:** Ester Saldana is a charismatic and ambitious individual with a strong sense of justice. She is compassionate, intelligent, and passionate about making a positive impact on her community. Her leadership skills are evident in her ability to inspire trust and loyalty in those around her.

**Physical Attributes:** Ester stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair and piercing green eyes. She has a warm and radiant smile that puts people at ease, and her confident demeanor commands respect.

**Interests:** Ester is an avid reader of Latin American literature and history, particularly the works of Octavio Paz and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. She also enjoys practicing yoga and hiking in the beautiful outdoors of Mexico. As a politician, she is deeply committed to social justice causes, including education, healthcare, and women's empowerment.

Please note that this character is entirely fictional, and any resemblance to the real Ester Saldaña is unintentional.
