Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Ibrahim Durchdenwald's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ibrahim appears to be a private and introspective individual who prefers solitude. He is cautious and guarded, as evident from his behavior in the alleyway when he feels like he's being watched. However, he also has a dry sense of humor and can come across as somewhat sarcastic, as seen in his response to Marcus's request for his expertise.

Despite his reserved nature, Ibrahim seems to be confident and calculating, making decisions quickly when necessary (e.g., deciding to confront Marcus). He is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, evident from his decision not to revisit the past with Marcus.

**Physical Attributes:** The story doesn't provide explicit details about Ibrahim's physical appearance beyond his eyes. However, based on his calm demeanor in the alleyway, it can be inferred that he carries himself with poise and composure. He might have a lean or athletic build, which would complement his height.

Assuming Ibrahim is a middle-aged man, let's assign him a height of around 6 feet (183 cm) and eye color to match those mentioned in the story â€“ piercing blue eyes.

**Interests:** Ibrahim's interests are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that he has a strong interest in business and finance. His expertise in the company's inner workings suggests that he has a deep understanding of its operations, which would have been gained through years of experience.

Ibrahim also appears to have a keen sense of observation, as seen in his ability to scan the area and detect subtle changes in his surroundings. This skillset might be useful in other areas of life, such as investigation or security work.

Lastly, Ibrahim's encounter with Marcus suggests that he may have a hidden interest in exposing deceitful practices or uncovering secrets, which could drive him to help those who seek his expertise but are not necessarily seeking revenge or personal gain.
