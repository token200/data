Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ibrahim Bergstr√∂m's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ibrahim is an inquisitive and driven individual, consumed by his passion for history. He is meticulous and thorough in his research, willing to spend countless hours pouring over ancient texts and scouring the countryside for clues. This fixation has led to a degree of obsession, but it also makes him determined and persistent. Despite the years of searching, Ibrahim's curiosity remains strong, propelling him forward even when hope seems lost.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Ibrahim's physical appearance. However, based on his occupation as an engineer and his Swedish heritage, it is reasonable to assume that he has a sturdy build and average to above-average height (around 5'10" or 178 cm). His eyes are likely brown, given his Scandinavian background.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Ibrahim's primary interest lies in history, particularly 19th-century warfare. He is fascinated by the stories of past events, figures, and people who shaped the world we live in today. This curiosity drives him to delve deeper into his research, seeking answers to questions that have puzzled him for years.

While there may be some overlap between these aspects (e.g., engineering and historical analysis), they seem to be separate passions that complement each other rather than replace one another entirely.
