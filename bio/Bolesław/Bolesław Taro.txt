Based on the short story, here is a summary of Bolesław Taro's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bolesław appears to be an introverted and introspective individual, with a strong passion for uncovering hidden secrets and stories. He is driven by a desire to understand the past and bring forgotten tales to light. His dedication to his research and quest to learn more about Tadeusz Kościuszko suggests that he is determined, focused, and perhaps slightly obsessive.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Bolesław's height is not specified in the story, but based on the fact that he navigates the mist-shrouded streets of Wrocław with ease, it can be assumed that he is of average to below-average height.
* Eye Color: The text does not mention Bolesław's eye color, so I will assume a neutral option such as brown or gray.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Bolesław's primary interest is in history, particularly Polish history and the lesser-known chapters of its narrative. He is also fascinated by obscure tales and stories, which led him to become obsessed with Tadeusz Kościuszko. His enthusiasm for history suggests that he may be an analytical thinker, detail-oriented, and perhaps slightly bookish.

Additional details:

* Age: Given his dedication to research and the fact that he stumbles upon an old manuscript in a university library, it is possible that Bolesław is an adult in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s.
* Education: As a historian and collector of obscure tales, it can be assumed that Bolesław has completed higher education in history or a related field, such as the University of Wrocław.

Overall, Bolesław Taro appears to be a thoughtful, driven individual with a passion for uncovering hidden stories and understanding the past.
