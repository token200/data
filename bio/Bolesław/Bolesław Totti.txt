**Personality:** Bolesław is known for his quick wit and sharp tongue, which often gets him into trouble. However, he has an infectious smile and charming demeanor that makes it impossible to stay mad at him for long. He is also fiercely passionate about social justice issues and human rights cases, driven by a strong sense of morality.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue

Bolesław's physical attributes suggest that he is a tall, lean man with bright blue eyes and dark brown hair. He appears fit and athletic, with a strong build that hints at his passion for outdoor activities or sports.
