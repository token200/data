Here is a summary of the fictional character Bolesław Kazuo:

**Physical Attributes:** Bolesław stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming presence. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his angular face. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seem to sparkle with curiosity.

**Personality:** Bolesław is an unconventional thinker who challenges the norms of traditional Polish nobility. He is resourceful, intelligent, and passionate about innovation, but not particularly interested in politics or material wealth. Despite being stuck in a world where titles hold little value, he exudes confidence and has a strong sense of purpose.

**Interests:** Bolesław's true passions lie in tinkering with machines and gadgets. He is fascinated by the inner workings of devices and enjoys figuring out how they work. His love for innovation and creativity drives him to collaborate with fellow inventors and dreamers, as seen in his partnership with Kazuo.

While not traditionally "noble" or refined, Bolesław's humility and determination make him an endearing figure who has found a sense of belonging among the eccentric inhabitants of Krakow.
