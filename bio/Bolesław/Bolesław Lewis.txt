Here's a summary of Bolesław Lewis's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bolesław is an enigmatic individual known for his razor-sharp wit and quick tongue. He has an air of mystery surrounding him, making it difficult for others to discern whether he is friend or foe. Despite this, he is a deeply emotional and sensitive person who wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to those close to him. Bolesław values authenticity and connection, often feeling like he's hiding behind a mask.

**Physical Attributes:** Bolesław stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His striking features are accentuated by his dark hair, which is often perfectly messy. He has a lean build and carries himself with an air of confidence that belies his introspective nature.

**Interests:** Bolesław's passions lie in music, poetry, and literature. As a child, he was constantly getting into mischief, but it wasn't until he discovered the world of words that he found his true calling. He is deeply influenced by Polish poets like Adam Mickiewicz and Julian Sigmundowicz, as well as the lesser-known Stanisław Przyłęcki, whose works hold a special place in his heart. When not writing or performing, Bolesław enjoys strolling through Krakow's winding streets with Zofia Kowalska, lost in conversation and deep connection.
