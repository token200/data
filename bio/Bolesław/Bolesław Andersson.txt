He stands around 5'10" (178 cm) tall and has a rugged, weathered face with deep lines etched into his forehead and around his eyes. His hair is gray, thinning, and often combed over to the side of his head. Despite his rough appearance, there's an air of quiet authority about him that commands respect.

**Personality:**
Bolesław is a man of mystery and introspection, with a dry sense of humor and a tendency to keep people at arm's length. He has a steely gaze that misses nothing, but beneath this tough exterior lies a complex web of emotions and motivations. As he navigates his new life in the village, Bolesław struggles to reconcile his past and present selves, revealing a depth of feeling that few people ever get to see.

**Interests:**
Bolesław's passions lie in tending to his garden and fixing broken appliances for the locals, activities that bring him a sense of purpose and connection. He also has a deep love for writing, having spent years scribbling notes and planning schemes in secret notebooks during his days as a spy. When Sophie arrives in the village, Bolesław is drawn to her fearlessness and creativity, and together they share stories and dreams that help him find closure and redemption.

**Other Details:**
Bolesław's past life as a spy is marked by secrecy and shadow, with few people knowing much about his work or the experiences he had. He has a network of old contacts and acquaintances who keep in touch with him from time to time, but for the most part, Bolesław prefers to keep his past private, even as he begins to open up to Sophie. Despite his tough exterior, Bolesław is vulnerable and sensitive, struggling to find his place in the world after leaving the spy game behind.
