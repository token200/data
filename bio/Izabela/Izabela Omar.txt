**Physical Attributes:** Izabela has an unmentioned height, but her slender build suggests she may be around 5'7"-6'0" (170-183 cm). Her eyes are an expressive shade of green, often described as "vibrant and sparkling like a Mediterranean sea". Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, which she wears with pride.

**Personality:** Izabela is an artist at heart, with a creative spark within her that cannot be contained. She is curious and driven, always seeking to uncover the hidden secrets of the world around her. Her passion for art is matched only by her curiosity about people and their stories, making her a magnet for new friends and connections. Izabela has a quirky sense of humor and can come across as introverted at times, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a fiery spirit that cannot be tamed.

**Interests:** As an aspiring artist, Izabela is deeply fascinated by the works of other creatives, particularly those who explore the intersection of art and magic. She spends countless hours pouring over books on art history, mythology, and philosophy, seeking to understand the deeper connections between the world around her and the creative process. When not lost in a book or studio, Izabela loves to wander through Barcelona's winding streets and alleys, taking in the sights, sounds, and scents of this enchanting city.
