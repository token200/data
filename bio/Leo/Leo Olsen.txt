Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Leo Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Leo is a contemplative and introspective person who has developed a strong sense of wonder and awe for the world around him. He values wisdom, adventure, and personal growth, as instilled by his grandfather Olaf. As he navigates life after his wife's passing, Leo has come to realize that there is still much to explore and discover in the world, and he is determined to live life on his own terms.

**Physical Attributes:** At 60 years old, Leo stands at approximately 6'2" with a rugged, weathered complexion. His eyes are a deep blue, like the ocean on a clear day. He has a strong build, honed from years of fishing and physical labor, but also bears the gentle lines of age.

**Interests:** Leo is passionate about fishing, particularly deep-sea angling, which has become a significant part of his identity. However, his interests extend beyond the sea itself to the world of navigation, knot-tying, and the art of exploration in general. He is deeply curious about the secrets of the ocean and seeks to uncover its mysteries.

Leo's love for storytelling and sharing tales with others (notably his grandfather Olaf) also suggests a strong affinity for history, culture, and the oral tradition of passing down wisdom from one generation to the next.

As Leo sorts through his tackle box, he is not just rummaging through old fishing gear but also through memories and life lessons. The wooden box with intricate carvings holds sentimental value and represents a connection to his grandfather's legacy, underscoring his deep respect for tradition, family history, and personal heritage.

In this sense, Leo Olsen is driven by a multifaceted love of adventure, learning, storytelling, and connecting with the world around him â€“ particularly that part which lies just beyond the horizon.
