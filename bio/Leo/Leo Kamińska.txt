**Personality:**
Leo is a complex individual with a mix of qualities that make him introspective and driven. He has a sense of independence as a journalist, but also struggles with feelings of guilt and abandonment due to his past decision to leave his family. This inner turmoil makes him feel lost and disconnected from those around him, often leaving him invisible to others. Despite this, he has a strong desire for purpose and meaning in his life.

**Physical Attributes:**
* Height: 6'0" (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel or brown eyes that have deepened with age
* Hair Color: Dark brown or auburn hair that is becoming increasingly thinning due to stress and anxiety

**Interests:**
As a journalist, Leo has an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. He enjoys researching stories and uncovering hidden truths, often at the cost of his personal relationships and mental well-being. His interests also include:

* Investigative journalism
* Reading (particularly historical non-fiction)
* Writing short stories and poetry in his free time

The mysterious message "Wait" from Kasia hints at Leo's curiosity about new experiences and opportunities, possibly indicating a renewed desire to rediscover himself and find purpose beyond the superficialities of fame.
