Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ryszard Stenström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ryszard appears to be a determined and driven individual. He is fiercely committed to uncovering the truth about his father's disappearance, which suggests that he values justice and seeking answers above all else. His low and even voice when ordering at the café also implies that he may be introverted or reserved in social situations. Additionally, Ryszard seems cautious and wary of potential danger, as evidenced by his constant scanning of the room for recognition and his quickened pace upon leaving the café.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of Ryszard's physical attributes, including height and eye color, in the provided short story. However, based on the character's demeanor and actions, it can be inferred that he may have an unassuming or plain appearance, which suits his reserved personality. If I were to imagine a physical description for Ryszard Stenström, I would picture him as being around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, and a ruggedly handsome face that speaks of a life spent in the outdoors.

**Interests:** Ryszard's primary interest is uncovering the truth about his father's disappearance. He seems driven by a desire for answers and justice, which suggests that he values knowledge and investigation above other pursuits. It can also be inferred that he has an interest in business or finance, given that his father was described as a "businessman." Additionally, Ryszard may have an interest in history or politics, as hinted at by the cryptic message from his old acquaintance, which seemed to suggest that Ryker Stenström was involved in something "big" and potentially sinister.
