He has a sharp mind and quick wit, which allowed him to carve out a niche for himself in the city despite facing poverty and neglect during his childhood. As he grew older, he became fascinated with photography and developed an unspoken understanding with those around him, particularly a mysterious woman he met at a café.

**Interests:** Photography is Ryszard's primary passion, which he has pursued for many years. He spent countless hours scouring flea markets and thrift stores for discarded cameras and lenses to restore and use in his work. His photographs are often described as windows into another world – a world of decay and rebirth, where the beauty lies in the brokenness.

In addition to photography, Ryszard seems to be drawn to other forms of creative expression, such as writing or possibly music. He is also deeply fascinated by the city he lives in, particularly its gritty underbelly and the people who inhabit it.
