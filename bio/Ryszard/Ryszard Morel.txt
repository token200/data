Here is a summary of Ryszard Morel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ryszard Morel is a complex and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a tendency to keep people at arm's length, which is partly due to the emotional scars he carries from his past experiences as a soldier. Despite this, he has a deep desire for human connection and can be quite charming when he wants to be. Morel is also fiercely independent and values his anonymity, which allows him to observe and connect with others without being judged.

**Physical Attributes:** Ryszard Morel stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean yet athletic build, likely honed from his military service. His piercing green eyes are an striking feature that misses nothing. His chiseled jawline is accentuated by the faint stubble on his chin, giving him a rugged and weathered appearance. His dark hair is typically unkempt, adding to his overall air of mystery.

**Interests:** Morel's interests seem to revolve around observing human behavior and listening to people's stories. He has a particular fondness for whiskey, which serves as a coping mechanism for his emotional scars. On rainy evenings like the one described in the story, he finds solace in being surrounded by strangers who don't know him, allowing him to momentarily escape his burdens.

It is also hinted at that Morel has a deep appreciation for music or possibly art, though this is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from his enjoyment of whiskey-fueled conversations and his desire to connect with others on a deeper level.
