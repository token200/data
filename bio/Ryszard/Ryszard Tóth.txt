**Physical Attributes:** Ryszard stands at an unremarkable height, which suggests that he may not be particularly tall or imposing. His eye color is indigo, an unsettling shade that hints at his mysterious nature.

**Personality:** Ryszard's personality appears to be complex and multifaceted. As a former operative for the Polish intelligence agency, Służba Bezpieczeństwa, he likely developed a reserved and calculating demeanor. His nickname "The Ghost" suggests that he is a skilled infiltrator who can move unseen and unheard, but it also implies a sense of detachment and emotional numbness. However, as hinted at by his reaction to the documents from Operation Słoneczny Płyn, Ryszard may be grappling with feelings of guilt, shame, and possibly even PTSD. This inner turmoil suggests that he is not simply a stoic figure but rather a human being struggling with the consequences of his past actions.

He may also have an interest in uncovering secrets and exposing corruption, as evidenced by the cryptic message from Janek.

In terms of hobbies or personal interests outside of espionage, it is unclear whether Ryszard has any. His quiet life in the countryside suggests that he may prefer solitude and simplicity to more urban pursuits. However, his reaction to the documents from Operation Słoneczny Płyn implies that he may be drawn to justice, truth, and possibly even redemption.

Overall, Ryszard's personality is a blend of stoicism, calculation, and emotional depth. His indigo eyes seem to hold secrets, and it will be interesting to see how he navigates the complex web of his past and present in future stories.
