Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ryszard Jansons' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 6 feet (183 cm) - The story doesn't explicitly state Ryszard's height, but it can be inferred that he is slightly above average due to the description of his rugged yet worn face.
- Eye Color: Deep brown - This is clearly stated in the story as a distinctive feature of Ryszard's appearance.
- Age: Mid-40s - The age is mentioned as part of the introductory paragraph.

**Personality:**

Ryszard Jansons appears to be a man with a troubled past. He is likely introverted and guarded, having experienced trauma from his time in the Polish underground resistance. His rugged yet worn face suggests a life of hardship, indicating that he has seen significant struggles. There's also an indication of a deep sense of responsibility or guilt (implied by the memories not shedding but instead still bearing weight), and a strong desire for redemption.

**Interests:**

While Ryszard's personal interests are not explicitly stated in the provided story, it can be inferred from his actions and reactions. The fact that he is sitting alone at a caf√© during the night suggests that he might enjoy quiet time or contemplation. His storytelling to Ola suggests an interest in sharing his experiences with others and possibly processing them for closure. The narrative also implies that Ryszard seeks personal redemption, which could be seen as a driving interest. However, given the limited information about his interests outside of his past and desire for redemption, it's challenging to pinpoint specific hobbies or passions beyond this context.

Please note that without more information, these inferences might slightly vary based on interpretation.
