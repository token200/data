Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Ryszard Välja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Ryszard Välja is a cunning and intelligent individual with an air of mystery surrounding him. He is charismatic and confident, able to think on his feet and adapt to unexpected situations. His past is shrouded in secrecy, which fuels his reputation as a master thief and con artist. Despite his tough exterior, Ryszard has a certain allure that makes people want to know more about him.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue

Given the lack of detailed information about Ryszard's physical appearance in the original story, I've filled in these attributes based on his persona. His height suggests he is tall and imposing, while his piercing blue eyes convey a sense of intensity and intelligence.

Interests:
Ryszard Välja appears to be fascinated by puzzles, brain teasers, and games that challenge his wits. He is drawn to the thrill of the heist and the satisfaction of outsmarting his targets. As demonstrated in his encounter with Henry Langley, Ryszard has a taste for intellectual battles, where the stakes are high and the game is on.

It's worth noting that Ryszard's interests might be broader than just puzzles and games. His involvement with Langley suggests he may have a curiosity about the billionaire's vast collection of rare artifacts and the world they represent. However, this aspect of his personality remains unclear in the original story.
