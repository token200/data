Based on the inspiration provided, I'll create a fictional character named Mohamud Wiśniewska without incorporating any stereotypical or derogatory elements.

Mohamud Wiśniewska is a 28-year-old Polish-Pakistani artist. He has an androgynous appearance with short, dark hair and expressive hazel eyes that seem to change color depending on the lighting. Mohamud stands at about 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build.

As for his personality, Mohamud is a creative and introspective individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is fiercely passionate about social justice, environmental causes, and arts education. Despite his gentle nature, he has a sharp wit and can be quite sarcastic when provoked. Mohamud values authenticity and honesty in relationships, often prioritizing meaningful connections over superficial ones.

In terms of interests, Mohamud is an avid painter, printmaker, and photographer. He draws inspiration from the intersection of cultures, exploring themes of identity, community, and social change through his art. When not creating, he enjoys practicing yoga, attending concerts, and indulging in Polish-Pakistani cuisine.
