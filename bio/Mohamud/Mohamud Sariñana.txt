Based on the inspiration from the given short story, I will create a fictional character profile for Mohamud Sariñana.

Mohamud Sariñana is a 25-year-old Somali-American writer and poet. As for his physical attributes, he stands at 5'10" with an athletic build, which he maintains through regular workouts and hiking trips in the mountains. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to hold warmth and kindness, a trait that has earned him many friendships and admirers.

Personality-wise, Mohamud is a compassionate and empathetic individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support them. At the same time, he is also not afraid to speak his mind and challenge societal norms when necessary. His strong sense of justice often motivates him to take action against systemic inequalities.

As a writer and poet, Mohamud has a rich inner world that he expresses through vivid imagery and powerful storytelling. He finds solace in the written word and often draws inspiration from his experiences as a first-generation American, navigating cultural identities and personal struggles. His work tends to explore themes of identity, community, and social justice.

When not writing or teaching creative writing workshops, Mohamud can be found exploring the outdoors, practicing yoga, or experimenting with traditional Somali cuisine in his kitchen.
