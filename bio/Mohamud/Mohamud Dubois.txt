Based on the inspiration from the short story, I will create a fictional character profile for Mohamud Dubois.

Mohamud Dubois is a 25-year-old Somali-American artist and community organizer. He has a strong sense of social justice and is deeply committed to advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.

Physically, Mohamud stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build. His eyes are a bright, piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is always neatly trimmed, and he often wears it with a small beard. He has a scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which he got while playing soccer.

Mohamud's personality is charismatic and confident, but also deeply empathetic and compassionate. He has a natural ability to connect with people from all walks of life and is able to listen actively and understand different perspectives. Despite his strong convictions, Mohamud is not afraid to admit when he is wrong and is always willing to learn and grow.

As an artist, Mohamud is passionate about using his mediums to tell stories that highlight social justice issues affecting his community. He spends countless hours painting, writing, and creating music that reflects his experiences as a young Muslim-American man. When he's not working on his art, Mohamud can be found volunteering at local organizations that support immigrant rights or attending community events that promote unity and understanding.

Overall, Mohamud Dubois is a complex and multifaceted individual who embodies the best qualities of a leader and a creative force for change.
