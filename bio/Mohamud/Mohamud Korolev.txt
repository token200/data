Based on the given restriction, I will create a fictional character that does not involve oppressive regimes.

 Mohamud Korolev is a 25-year-old anthropologist from Kazakhstan. He stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall and has warm, hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity whenever he discusses his field of study. His dark brown hair is often messy, as if he's just rolled out of bed, which suits his laid-back demeanor.

Mohamud is a free-spirited individual who values cultural diversity and understanding above all else. He has a warm and approachable personality, which allows him to connect with people from all walks of life. His passion for anthropology drives him to explore the world's diverse cultures, and he spends most of his free time reading about history, philosophy, or linguistics.

In his free time, Mohamud enjoys practicing yoga, hiking in the mountains, or cooking traditional Kazakh dishes. He is also an avid learner and has a fascination with ancient civilizations, often finding himself lost in the pages of historical texts or watching documentaries on archaeological discoveries.

Mohamud's interests extend beyond academics; he is also passionate about music, particularly traditional Kazakh folk songs, which he plays on his guitar. His warm smile and infectious laughter make him a beloved figure among his friends and colleagues alike.
