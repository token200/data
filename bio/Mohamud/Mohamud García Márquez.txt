Based on the constraint provided, I will create a fictional character profile for Mohamud García Márquez. Since no specific short story is mentioned, I'll draw inspiration from Gabriel García Márquez's style and literary themes.

**Personality:**
Mohamud García Márquez is a complex and introspective individual with a rich inner world. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms and expectations. This inclination towards dissent can sometimes lead to friction with those around him, but it also fuels his passion for justice and human rights. Mohamud has a dry sense of humor and can come across as enigmatic or aloof to those who don't know him.

**Physical Attributes:**
Mohamud García Márquez is of medium build, standing at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lean physique. His hair is dark brown and often worn long, framing his heart-shaped face and angular features. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a world of wisdom and intensity.

**Interests:**
Mohamud is an avid reader and writer, drawn to the works of 19th-century European authors and Latin American literature. He has a particular fondness for the works of Jorge Luis Borges and Alejo Carpentier, which reflect his fascination with the human condition, politics, and social justice. In his free time, Mohamud enjoys playing traditional Afro-Colombian music on the guacharaca (a wooden scraper instrument) and exploring the urban landscapes of Medellín, where he grew up.

Please note that this character profile is entirely fictional and not inspired by any real individual, including Gabriel García Márquez's family members.
