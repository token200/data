Based on the inspiration from the short story, I will create a new character that is respectful and diverse.

Here's a summary of Mohamud Kamińska:

Mohamud Kamińska is a 25-year-old Somali-American artist. Physically, he stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with dark brown eyes and black hair that is often styled in a trendy undercut. He has a strong presence, but his gentle smile and warm demeanor put those around him at ease.

Personality-wise, Mohamud is a creative problem-solver with a passion for social justice. He is fiercely loyal to his friends and family and will go to great lengths to support them. At the same time, he is not afraid to speak his mind and challenge unjust systems when he sees them. Mohamud has a quick wit and enjoys engaging in thoughtful conversations about politics, culture, and identity.

In terms of interests, Mohamud is an avid painter, poet, and writer. He draws inspiration from his Somali heritage and the experiences of immigrants in America. When he's not creating art, you can find him attending protests, volunteering at local community centers, or practicing yoga to manage stress. Despite his many commitments, Mohamud prioritizes self-care and makes time for meditation and reading.

Overall, Mohamud is a thoughtful and creative individual who uses his talents to make a positive impact in the world around him.
