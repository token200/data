Based on the story about Mohamed Dąbrowski, I can create a new character profile for Mohamud Dąbrowska. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mohamud Dąbrowska stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean build. His dark brown eyes are almond-shaped and fringed with thick eyelashes, giving him an exotic look. He has short, jet-black hair that is often styled in a neat, messy fashion. Mohamud's skin has a warm, golden undertone, a testament to his mixed heritage.

**Personality:**
Mohamud is a driven and ambitious individual who shares Mohamed's passion for journalism. He is fiercely independent and values truth-telling above all else. Mohamud is not afraid to take risks and challenge authority when he believes it's necessary to uncover the truth. Despite this, he has a compassionate side and cares deeply about the people affected by corruption and injustice.

**Interests:**
Mohamud is an avid reader of history, politics, and philosophy. He enjoys learning about different cultures and languages, often spending hours practicing Arabic and Polish in his free time. When not working on stories, Mohamud loves to explore Warsaw's hidden corners, trying new foods and visiting local markets. He is also a talented musician and plays the oud, a traditional Middle Eastern instrument, when he has the chance.

In terms of specific interests outside of journalism, Mohamud enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain his mental clarity and focus. He is also an avid fan of Warsaw's football team, Legia Warsaw, and spends his Sundays watching games with friends.
