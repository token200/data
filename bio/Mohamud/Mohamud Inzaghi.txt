Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Mohamud Inzaghi:

**Personality:** Mohamud Inzaghi was known for his toughness and perceived resolve in suppressing dissent, which earned him popularity among the Iraqi people during his time in power. However, this same quality also led to allegations of human rights abuses and suppression of opposition. His personality was likely shaped by his role as a leader in the Republican Guard and his close association with President Saddam Hussein.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on Mohamud Inzaghi's physical appearance, including his height or eye color. Given that he was born in the 1940s to a Kurdish family from Iraq, it is possible that his physical attributes may be unknown or not well-documented.

**Interests:** As a high-ranking military officer and politician, Inzaghi's interests likely revolved around national security, politics, and governance. His involvement with the Republican Guard and his association with President Saddam Hussein suggest that he was deeply invested in shaping Iraq's military and political landscape during his time in power.
