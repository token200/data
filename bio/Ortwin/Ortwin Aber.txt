Here's a summary of Ortwin Aber's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Ortwin stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an ageless yet weathered appearance. His wild grey hair is his most striking feature, often whipped into a frenzy by the wind. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a wealth of wisdom and experience. He has a rugged, bronzed complexion from years spent outdoors, and a few wisps of silver flecking through his eyebrows add to his distinguished look.

**Personality:** Ortwin is a contemplative and introspective individual with a deep love for the natural world. He's a free spirit, having spent many years as a sailor and exploring the coastlines in search of adventure and inspiration. As an artist, he's fiercely passionate about capturing the essence of his experiences on canvas. Despite being a recluse, Ortwin is warm and welcoming to those who share his love for art and nature.

**Interests:** Ortwin is deeply interested in painting, particularly watercolors, as they allow him to capture the ephemeral beauty of the sea and its creatures. He's also an avid storyteller, having spent many years sharing tales of his adventures with sailors, travelers, and fellow artists. In addition to art and storytelling, Ortwin has a profound respect for the natural world, which he seeks to preserve through his work and advocacy.

As we can see from the short story, Ortwin's life takes an exciting turn when Luna enters his world, reigniting his passion for art, connection, and purpose.
