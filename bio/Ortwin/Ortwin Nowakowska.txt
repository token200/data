Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ortwin Nowakowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ortwin is an enigmatic and introverted individual. Despite her success in the fashion industry, she keeps her personal life shrouded in mystery. She has a troubled past that continues to affect her, but it also fuels her creativity and passion for design. Ortwin appears to be a perfectionist who turns to her work as a coping mechanism when feeling overwhelmed or emotional.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown

Unfortunately, the text does not provide any other physical attributes, so I can only fill in the remaining gaps with general assumptions. Assuming Ortwin has an athletic yet slender build, a pale complexion due to her Eastern European heritage and possible sensitivity to sunlight, and straight, dark hair that falls below her shoulders.

**Interests:** Fashion, art, design, travel (especially to major fashion capitals like Paris, Milan, and New York), history, traditional Polish folk patterns, culture, and personal growth. Ortwin seems to be particularly fascinated with the intersection of art and couture, blurring the lines between creative expression and fashion.

Based on her personality, physical attributes, and interests, Ortwin appears to be a complex, creative individual driven by both artistic passion and personal struggles.
