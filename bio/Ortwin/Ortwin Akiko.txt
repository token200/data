Here is a summary of Ortwin Akiko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ortwin is a free-spirited individual who defies tradition and expectation. He has grown tired of living up to the weight of his family's legacy and is eager to forge his own path. Despite being part of the prestigious Akiko clan, he is not bound by protocol or custom. Instead, he values exploration, discovery, and self-discovery.

**Physical Attributes:** Ortwin stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to hold a hint of intensity even when his gaze is calm. His dark hair is often unkempt and tousled, framing his sharp features. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many adventures.

**Interests:** Ortwin's primary interest lies in exploring the hidden corners of Kyoto and uncovering its secrets. He is drawn to stories, myths, and legends that shed light on the city's rich history and cultural heritage. His visit to "Kokoro no Kizu" suggests a deep fascination with the mysterious and unknown, as well as an openness to unconventional wisdom. Ortwin is also naturally curious and enjoys listening to people's tales and experiences, often seeking guidance from those who possess knowledge or insight he lacks.

The encounter with the old woman at "Kokoro no Kizu" reveals that Ortwin is not only drawn to the mystical but also struggles with self-doubt and uncertainty. His desire for change and growth suggests a yearning for personal growth and exploration of his own identity outside of family expectations.
