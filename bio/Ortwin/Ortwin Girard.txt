Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ortwin Girard:

**Personality:** Ortwin Girard is a complex and enigmatic individual with a mix of traits that define him. On one hand, he has an air of quiet confidence and command respect from those who know him, which suggests that he is a natural leader or at least has a strong sense of authority. This confidence likely stems from his experiences as a former spy for the French intelligence agency, where he had to rely on his wits and resourcefulness to stay one step ahead of his enemies. Despite his tough exterior, Ortwin Girard also seems to be introspective and perhaps even melancholic, given that he has built walls around himself over the years to protect against getting hurt or betrayed.

**Physical Attributes:** We can infer some details about Ortwin Girard's physical appearance from the story. He is not explicitly described as being physically fit, but since he lives on a vineyard and spends his days tending to it, it's likely that he has a rugged and weathered physique. Assuming this, we could estimate his height to be around 5'9" (175 cm), which is relatively tall for the average Frenchman. His eye color is not specified in the story, but considering his nationality and age, we might assume that they are a deep brown or blue, with piercing green eyes being an unlikely choice given his reserved nature.

**Interests:** Based on Ortwin Girard's new life in Provence, it seems that he has developed a passion for viticulture (the study of wine production) and living off the land. His work on the vineyard suggests that he enjoys manual labor and is content to spend time outdoors, soaking up the beauty of nature. He also appears to appreciate solitude and quiet contemplation, as evident from his decision to leave the espionage game behind in search of a simpler existence.

Please note that these are educated guesses based on a limited narrative, and the story could potentially be expanded or modified to further develop Ortwin Girard's character and backstory.
