Based on the short story, here's a summary of Isidor Sten's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - making him a tall, imposing figure
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you
* Hair: Jet-black hair that falls across his forehead like a curtain

**Personality:**

Isidor is a brooding and intense individual with a troubled past. He has a reputation for being able to sniff out secrets and lies, which fuels the rumors about him. Despite this, he's not necessarily a hero or villain; rather, he's a seeker of justice who's willing to walk the fine line between right and wrong. He's fiercely independent and appears to be haunted by his own demons.

**Interests:**

* Investigating corruption and deceit in the city
* Uncovering secrets and lies (his "specialty")
* Seeking justice, even if it means bending the rules
* Smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey (specifically black vodka)
* Music and laughter - as evident from the tavern setting where he often spends his nights

It's worth noting that Isidor seems to be a man of few words and doesn't shy away from confrontation. His intense gaze can be intimidating, but it also hints at a deep-seated vulnerability. Despite this, he has an unshakeable sense of purpose, which drives him forward even in the face of uncertainty.
