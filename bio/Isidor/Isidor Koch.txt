Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Isidor Koch:

**Personality:** Isidor Koch was a brilliant and introverted physicist with an unwavering passion for understanding the mysteries of quantum mechanics. He was driven by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge. Despite his reclusive nature, he possessed a dry sense of humor and an unsettling smile that made others feel uneasy.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Piercing blue
* **Hair:** Dark brown, often unkempt and messy

**Interests:**

* Physics and mathematics, particularly quantum mechanics and theoretical physics
* Reading scientific papers and articles on advanced topics
* Conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory, where he would often lose himself for hours or even days at a time
* Collecting rare and obscure scientific texts, which he would use as references for his research

It's worth noting that while the original story doesn't provide much information about Isidor's background or early life, I've tried to fill in some gaps based on his personality and interests. His fascination with science and mathematics from a young age, combined with his love of reading and experimenting, suggests that he was likely an intense and focused individual from the start.
