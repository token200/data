Here's a summary of the fictional character Celia Kwiatkowska:

**Physical Attributes:** Celia is a woman in her mid-to-late 30s, with a slender yet athletic build. She stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) and has long, dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep, rich blue that sparkle with warmth and kindness.

**Personality:** Celia is a creative and compassionate individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is passionate about art, music, and helping others, which makes her an excellent art teacher and musician. Despite facing difficulties in her personal life, particularly the estrangement from her sister Rachel, Celia remains optimistic and empathetic, always willing to listen and forgive.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, Celia has a deep love for art and music. She is an accomplished violinist who plays with incredible skill and passion. In addition to her musical talents, Celia also values education and is dedicated to sharing her knowledge of the arts with others, particularly young students at her part-time teaching position.
