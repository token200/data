Based on the short story inspired by Jorge Luis Borges, I've created a fictional character profile for Celia Luis Borges:

**Name:** Celia Luis Borges

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright, piercing green eyes that seem to sparkle with intellectual curiosity
* Hair: Dark brown hair that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a messy bun when she's working on her writing
* Skin Tone: A smooth, golden-brown complexion from spending countless hours outdoors exploring the streets of Buenos Aires
* Style: Celia has a relaxed, eclectic sense of style, often mixing vintage pieces with modern accessories. She favors comfortable clothing that allows her to move freely, as if she's always ready to disappear into the labyrinth of her own imagination.

**Personality:**

* Celia is an introverted, creative soul with a deep love for literature and philosophy.
* She's fiercely independent and determined to forge her own path in life, even when it means challenging the conventional wisdom of those around her.

**Interests:**

* Philosophy (especially existentialism and phenomenology) is a constant source of fascination for Celia, inspiring new ideas and perspectives in her writing.
* Exploring the streets of Buenos Aires and discovering hidden corners and secret spots becomes an integral part of her creative process.
* Collecting rare books and manuscripts from the Argentine master himself is also a favorite pastime of hers.

**Other Details:**

* Celia has a small tattoo of a labyrinth on her left wrist, symbolizing the infinite possibilities and paradoxical truths that she's always seeking to uncover.
* She often finds solace in the company of old books, which she believes hold secrets and stories from a bygone era.
* Despite her passion for writing, Celia struggles with self-doubt at times, but she knows that it's a necessary part of the creative process.
