**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (172 cm) - This height suggests that Celia is a slender woman with an athletic build, fitting for someone who values her appearance.
- Eye Color: Brown - Brown eyes often convey warmth, kindness, and intelligence, traits that are consistent with Celia's personality as depicted in the story.

**Personality:**
Celia appears to be an individual of great poise and tact. She presents a polished exterior, always making sure her appearance is impeccable for social occasions. Her ability to adjust her gloves multiple times in front of the mirror indicates a strong sense of self-consciousness about her appearance and an emphasis on being "on." This suggests that she has high standards, which can sometimes be perceived as critical or perfectionistic.

She also exhibits good interpersonal skills by being able to pretend interest in her husband's stories while genuinely counting down the minutes until they can leave. This ability shows she is adaptable but possibly unenthusiastic about some aspects of life, particularly those related to her marriage and its responsibilities.

Furthermore, Celia displays empathy towards others when interacting with her childhood friend Kate, offering support during a difficult period in Kate's life. This suggests that beneath her polished exterior lies a compassionate heart capable of emotional depth.

- Caring about the well-being of others: Given Celia's empathetic response to Kate's situation, it suggests that caring about someone's well-being is one of her interests.

- Personal freedom: The story hints at a sense of disillusionment in her marriage, which can imply an interest in personal liberation or autonomy. This might be driven by a desire to break free from the constraints of a life not entirely chosen for herself.

Overall, Celia Kowalski seems to be a complex individual with multiple layers beneath her polished exterior, embodying traits such as empathy, adaptability, and perhaps a deeper yearning for freedom or personal fulfillment.
