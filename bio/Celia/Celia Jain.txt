The physical attributes provided in the short story do not include much information about Celia Jain's height and eye color, so I have filled in these details based on my understanding of typical astrophysicist profiles. The dark brown eyes suggest a warm and intelligent individual, while the jet-black hair implies a reserved and private person.

**Interests:**

* **Science and Mathematics:** Celia's passion for astrophysics is evident throughout her work, and she spends most of her time studying the mysteries of black holes.
* **Poetry and Classical Music:** In addition to her love for science and mathematics, Celia also has a fondness for poetry and classical music. These interests are hinted at through her mother's words: "The universe is full of mysteries waiting to be unraveled."
