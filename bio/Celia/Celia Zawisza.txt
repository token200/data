Based on the short story, here is a summary of Celia Zawisza's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Celia is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a tough exterior and a sharp wit. She has a quick tongue and is known for her sarcasm, which often hides a deeper emotional depth. Despite her rough past, she has developed a strong sense of resilience and determination, which drives her to take risks and push boundaries. However, beneath her confident facade lies a web of emotions that she guards closely.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes with a hint of gold around the iris, which seem to sparkle with mischief.
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy bob that frames her face.
* Build: Athletic and lean, honed from years of physical activity on the streets.

**Interests:** Celia is fascinated by art, history, and antiques, particularly rare gemstones like the Starlight Serenade. She has an eye for detail and a passion for understanding the stories behind the artifacts she steals. Her love for thievery is matched only by her love of adventure, exploration, and living on the edge. When not in pursuit of the next mark, Celia enjoys spending time alone, observing human behavior, and collecting secrets.

It's worth noting that while Celia's interests are focused on art and antiques, they may be seen as morally ambiguous due to her profession as a thief. Her fascination with these areas serves as a reminder that even those who engage in illicit activities can have complex motivations and desires that drive their actions.
