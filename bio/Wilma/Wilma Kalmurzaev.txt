Here's a summary of Wilma Kalmurzaev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wilma is an introspective and enigmatic person. She appears reserved and distant at first glance, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a complex and adventurous individual. As she opens up to others, particularly Mikhail, it becomes apparent that she has a dry sense of humor and can be witty. Despite her tough exterior, she has a vulnerable side and is fiercely independent, having grown up on the move with her nomadic parents.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: A deep, rich blue that seems almost otherworldly
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn in a messy bob
* Skin: Olive-toned, with a scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose

**Interests:** Wilma has a love for exploration and adventure, which was instilled in her by her nomadic upbringing. She's an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. Music is also a significant part of her life, with a fondness for folk and indie rock. When she's feeling restless, she enjoys taking long walks or hikes, often in areas where the wilderness meets the urban landscape.

Her fascination with the universe and the mysteries of life drives her to question her place in the world and seek answers through introspection and self-discovery. This journey of self-discovery has led her to reevaluate her past and find a sense of belonging in Azalia, which she hopes will be a stepping stone for further exploration and growth.
