Based on the inspiration provided by the short story about Wilma Tzu-chi, I have created a fictional character profile that fills in any missing details.

* Despite her artistic talents, Wilma is humble and unassuming, preferring to let her work speak for itself rather than drawing attention to herself.

**Interests:**

* Philosophy and spirituality (Wilma finds solace in ancient texts and teachings that promote balance and harmony).
* Music (she is particularly fond of traditional Chinese instruments, such as the erhu and guqin).

**Additional Details:**
