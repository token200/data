Here is a summary of Wilma Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wilma is a fiercely independent woman with a sharp tongue and quick wit. She has a tough exterior but a soft spot for strays and those in need of help. She can come across as sassy or sarcastic at first, but once you get to know her, she reveals a kind and compassionate heart.

**Physical Attributes:** Wilma stands at 5'8" with curly brown hair that often escapes her ponytail and bright green eyes that sparkle with mischief. Her style is eclectic and practical, reflecting her love of animals and the outdoors.

**Interests:** Wilma's passions lie in caring for animals, particularly those who have been abandoned or neglected. She runs a humble animal shelter on the outskirts of Willow Creek, where she spends most of her days rescuing and rehabilitating furry friends. She also enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's walking her own dogs or exploring the surrounding countryside.

In addition to her love of animals, Wilma is a voracious reader and enjoys a good book, especially those with strong female protagonists.

Above all, she values honesty, kindness, and a good sense of humor â€“ qualities that make her the beloved matriarch of Willow Creek.

It's worth noting that Wilma is not particularly athletic or outdoorsy, preferring to spend her free time indoors with a book or at the shelter tending to her animals. Despite this, she has a strong work ethic and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.
