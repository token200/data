I've created a fictional character inspired by Martina Navratilova's personality, physical attributes, and interests. Here's a summary:

**Name:** Wilma "Wil" Rodriguez

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue with green undertones
* Hair Color: Dark brown with subtle highlights of blonde
* Body Type: Athletic build, toned from years of tennis training and outdoor activities
* Style: Wil is often seen wearing sleek, modern outfits that showcase her athletic prowess. She has a fondness for bold colors and statement accessories.

**Personality:**

* Wil is a fiercely competitive individual who embodies the spirit of a champion. Her drive to succeed is unwavering, and she sets high standards for herself in both tennis and off the court.
* With a quick wit and sharp tongue, Wil is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in. She's an outspoken advocate for social justice and LGBTQ+ rights.
* Despite her tough exterior, Wil has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards others. Her strong sense of loyalty and friendship earns her many close relationships throughout her life.

**Interests:**

* Tennis (of course!) is Wil's first love, but she also enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being.
* Music is a passion of hers; she plays the guitar and loves listening to folk, jazz, and electronic music.
* Wil is an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. She finds inspiration in stories about strong women who have overcome adversity.
