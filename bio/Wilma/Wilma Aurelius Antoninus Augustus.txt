Here is a summary of the fictional character Wilma Aurelius Antoninus Augustus:

**Personality:** Wilma is a calculating, ambitious, and cunning individual with a strong desire for power and recognition. She is intelligent, strategic, and able to think several steps ahead of those around her. Despite her icy demeanor, she possesses a quiet dignity and composure that inspires confidence in those who interact with her.

**Physical Attributes:** Wilma stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often styled in intricate updos that showcase her aristocratic heritage. Her eyes are piercing green, a trait shared by her distant cousin Marcus Aurelius, which seems to gleam with intensity when she speaks.

**Interests:** Wilma's interests lie primarily in politics, diplomacy, and strategic maneuvering, reflecting her dedication to power and recognition. She is well-versed in the arts of espionage, interrogation, and psychological manipulation, skills she honed during her years as a member of the imperial court. When not attending to matters of state, Wilma enjoys reading classical literature, particularly works by Roman authors such as Cicero and Virgil, which fuel her fascination with history and its role in shaping the course of empires.

It's worth noting that while Wilma is described as having a "tenuous claim to the throne" due to her illegitimate birth, this does not seem to hinder her ambition or motivation to seize power. Instead, it appears to have fueled her determination to prove herself as a worthy ruler in her own right.
