**Personality:** Wilma Poirier is described as a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Bayou Teche. She is ambitious, driven, and passionate about her family's legacy restaurant, Poirier's. However, she remains humble and true to her roots, valuing tradition and heritage. This suggests that Wilma has a strong sense of identity and community ties.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8"

Additionally, I imagine Wilma as having:

* A fit and toned physique from years of working in the kitchen
* A warm and welcoming smile that puts customers at ease
* A sparkle in her eye when she talks about food or her passion for cooking

**Interests:**

* Cooking and experimenting with new recipes and flavors (particularly seafood)
* Cajun cuisine and Louisiana heritage
* Sharing knowledge and teaching others about traditional Cajun cooking methods
* Family history and legacy, particularly her father Ã‰tienne's influence on Poirier's restaurant
* Mardi Gras celebrations and the annual festival in Bayou Teche

Wilma's interests are deeply rooted in her family's tradition and heritage, but she also has a passion for innovation and sharing that knowledge with others.
