Based on the inspiration from the short story, I will create a fictional character profile for Arend Bērziņš:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 175 cm (5'9")
- Eye Color: Blue, with a hint of green around the iris, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea
- Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, short, and neatly styled, often tied back in a ponytail
- Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders from years of physical labor in his bakery

Personality:
Arend Bērziņš is a warm and humble individual who exudes a sense of pride in his Latvian heritage. He has a quick wit and infectious smile that puts those around him at ease, making him an exceptional baker but also an effective community leader. Arend values tradition, yet he is always open to innovation and willing to take calculated risks to improve his craft.

Interests:
Arend Bērziņš has a deep passion for baking and food preservation. He spends hours experimenting with new recipes, learning from local farmers about seasonal ingredients, and studying traditional Latvian cooking techniques. In his free time, he enjoys hiking in the nearby forests, exploring old ruins, and listening to folk music, which often inspires him for new creations.

In terms of personal life, Arend Bērziņš lives with his partner, a talented food photographer named Marika Vīķe (who helps promote his bakery on social media), in a cozy cottage at the outskirts of Riga.
