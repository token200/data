Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Arend Kovacs:

**Personality:** Arend is a determined and introspective detective with a strong sense of justice. He has seen his fair share of gruesome crime scenes and has developed a tough exterior to cope with the emotional toll of his work. However, beneath this surface, he has a deep sense of empathy for victims like Sophia Grant, which drives him to solve her case. He is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a rugged, athletic build that speaks to his physically demanding job. His dark hair is often messy, and he has piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He sports a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, hinting at a troubled past.

**Interests:** Arend is a bit of a loner, but his interests include:

* Smoking: Arend enjoys smoking cigarettes as a way to calm his nerves and clear his mind.
* Music: Although not explicitly mentioned in the story, it's implied that Arend might have a taste for classic rock or jazz, given his old-school demeanor.
* Solving puzzles and crimes: As a detective, Arend is naturally drawn to solving complex mysteries and uncovering hidden clues. This fascination drives him to keep working on Sophia's case, even when the going gets tough.

Missing details that I've added:

* Age: Late 30s or early 40s, allowing for some experience and wisdom in his profession.
* Occupation: Detective with the Homicide Division, specializing in cold cases and missing persons cases.
* Education: Possibly a degree in criminology or law enforcement, which has equipped him with a solid foundation to tackle complex crimes.

These details provide a more complete picture of Arend Kovacs as a character, while still leaving room for interpretation and development in future stories.
