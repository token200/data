Here's a summary of Arend Handschuh's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend is a complex and intense individual with a tough exterior that hides a deep sense of vulnerability. As a former East German athlete turned mercenary, he has built a reputation for being one of the toughest and most feared fighters in the business. However, after a near-fatal accident left him with a severely injured hand, Arend was forced to re-evaluate his life choices. He is now driven by a sense of responsibility and loyalty, which motivates him to protect those in need. Despite his tough demeanor, Arend has a soft spot for those who are vulnerable or in danger, which makes him fiercely protective of Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Weight: 190 lbs (86 kg)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, short and neatly trimmed
* Build: Muscular and athletic, with a toned physique honed from years of martial arts training and combat sports.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow (from his mercenary days).

**Interests:** Arend's interests are largely centered around his work as a private security contractor. He is passionate about staying in top physical condition, honing his skills in various martial arts disciplines, and staying up-to-date with the latest security technologies. In his free time, he enjoys watching old East German sports footage (a nostalgic nod to his athletic past) or listening to hard rock music.

However, as he begins to develop feelings for Sophia, Arend's interests start to shift. He becomes fascinated by her world and is drawn into a new realm of emotions and experiences that challenge everything he thought he knew about himself and his place in the world.
