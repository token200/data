Based on the short story, here is a summary of Arend Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend Faust is a complex and introspective character. He is haunted by the weight of centuries spent watching civilizations rise and fall, which has hardened his heart and dulled his emotions. Despite this, he retains a deep sense of vulnerability and a longing for human connection. His experience with immortality has made him somewhat detached from the world around him, but when he meets Sophia, he begins to question his priorities and desires something more genuine.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend Faust is tall, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and unkempt, and his eyes are piercing green, a trait that hints at the devilish influence of Mephistopheles. His skin has a pale, almost translucent quality, a testament to his prolonged exposure to the underworld.

**Interests:** Arend's interests have evolved over the centuries, from an initial fascination with exploring the world and learning its secrets to a deeper appreciation for human connections. He is drawn to the beauty of nature, particularly sunsets, which hold a certain significance for him. His interest in Sophia reveals a desire to understand the complexities of the human heart, something he had lost touch with due to his immortal existence.

As Arend navigates his newfound connection with Sophia, it becomes clear that he has developed an appreciation for simple pleasures like music, art, and literature. However, these interests are still tempered by his complex past and the weight of his immortality.

Overall, Arend Faust is a multidimensional character driven by both melancholy and curiosity, seeking to redefine himself in a world that continues to evolve despite his own stagnation.
