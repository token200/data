Here is a summary of Arend Singh's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend Singh is a passionate and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the expectations placed upon him by his family. Despite this, he has a strong sense of loyalty and duty to those he cares about, particularly Ryker, who becomes a mentor and father figure to him.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His hair is dark brown and straight, framing his heart-shaped face and expressive brown eyes that seem to gleam with excitement whenever he talks about combat or swordsmanship. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his early training sessions.

**Interests:** Arend's primary interest is in the art of swordsmanship, particularly the ancient techniques described in the long-forgotten treatise he discovered. He is deeply fascinated by the strategies and philosophies outlined within, and spends hours pouring over the book and practicing its teachings. In addition to his martial pursuits, Arend is also drawn to history, philosophy, and politics, often spending his free time reading and studying these subjects.

It's worth noting that, while Ryker's influence has a profound impact on Arend's life, it's not immediately clear whether the two men are romantically involved or if their relationship will evolve over time.
