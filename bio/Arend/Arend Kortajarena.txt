Here is a summary of Arend Kortajarena's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend Kortajarena is known for his unyielding dedication to his craft and his commitment to excellence. He is humble, kind-hearted, and generous, often using his platform to support emerging artists and charitable organizations. Despite his success, he remains grounded and focused on his art, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in ballet.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend Kortajarena stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build honed from years of rigorous training. His eyes are an piercing shade of blue that seem to sparkle with intensity on stage. His dark hair is always perfectly styled, framing his chiseled features and elegant facial structure.

**Interests:** Arend's passion for dance is all-consuming, but he also has a deep appreciation for the arts in general. In his free time, he enjoys attending concerts, opera performances, and theater productions. He is particularly drawn to works by choreographers who push the boundaries of classical dance, such as George Balanchine and William Forsythe. When not on stage or rehearsing, Arend can be found reading about art history, philosophy, or psychology, seeking to deepen his understanding of the human experience.

It's worth noting that I made some creative choices to fill in missing details, such as Arend's eye color (blue) and physical build (lean and athletic). I also added a few interests that seem fitting for someone with his background and personality.
