Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges, I've created a new character profile for Arend Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**
Arend is a slender and agile individual, standing at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build. His dark brown eyes seem to hold a perpetual glint of curiosity, as if always searching for hidden meanings beneath the surface. His unruly black hair often falls across his forehead in a way that adds to his air of introspection.

**Personality:**
Arend is an enigmatic and introspective person with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding. He has a habit of losing himself in thought, often becoming so absorbed in contemplation that he forgets about his surroundings. This tendency can make him appear detached or aloof to those who don't know him, but beneath the surface lies a complex web of emotions and thoughts.

**Interests:**
Arend's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his fascination with multiple selves and identities. He is an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, literature, and history. His love for puzzles, riddles, and cryptic messages often leads him to explore the realms of cryptography, coding, and ciphers.

**Additional Quirks:**

* Arend has a habit of collecting strange, seemingly unrelated objects that spark his curiosity. He finds them in unexpected places, from antique shops to flea markets.
* He is an accomplished writer and poet, often expressing himself through short stories and fragmented narratives that reflect his own fractured identity.
* Arend's interests also extend to the realm of mythology and folklore, where he sees echoes of his multiple selves reflected in ancient legends and myths.

**Overall:**
Arend Luis Borges is a complex and intriguing individual, with a rich inner life and a penchant for exploration. His fascination with multiple identities and selves has led him on a journey of self-discovery, where the boundaries between reality and fiction blur, and the nature of existence remains an open question.
