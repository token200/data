Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Arend Askarova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend Askarova appears to be a passionate and protective individual when it comes to emerging artists. She has a reputation for being brutally honest as an art critic and historian but also demonstrates empathy and kindness towards Alisher Aliyev during their conversation. Her willingness to take risks and champion new talent suggests that she is open-minded and adventurous.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Arend's physical attributes. However, it can be inferred that she likely has a slender build and an interest in traditional Uzbek textiles, as she wears or displays them on her clothing or around her person. 

Since Arend Askarova is described as being in her mid-to-late thirties from the story context, we may need to guess height. Assuming a typical build for someone of her background in Tatar ethnicity and culture from Central Asia, and general physical trends of such individuals, she could likely be around 5'4" or about average height.

The color of Arend's eyes cannot be directly inferred without additional information; however, considering the context provided by the cultural background that encompasses Askarova (both Uzbek and Tatar), her eye color might likely be a combination of different eye colors typical of Central Asian people.
