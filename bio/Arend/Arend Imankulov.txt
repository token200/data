**Physical Attributes:** Arend stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a deep intensity. His dark hair is flecked with gray, hinting at his age. He has a lean yet athletic build, a testament to his past life as an operative. Over time, however, he appears more relaxed and softer around the edges, like a worn coat.
