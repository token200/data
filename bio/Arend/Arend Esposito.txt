Here is a summary of Arend Esposito's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend is a determined and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. He has a natural talent for investigation and a keen instinct for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend is likely in his mid-40s, with an athletic build that suggests a rugged upbringing. His height is around 6 feet (183 cm), allowing him to navigate crowded streets and buildings with ease. His bright blue eyes are his most striking feature, often squinting against the glare of sunlight or other intense light sources.

**Interests:** Arend's interests seem to revolve around investigation and problem-solving. As a former cop from Manhattan's South Bronx, he likely developed strong analytical skills and attention to detail during his time on the force. Outside of work, he may enjoy reading and researching cases that have gone cold or unsolved, seeking inspiration for new investigations.

Other details to flesh out Arend's character include:

* His background as a cop: Perhaps Arend grew up in a tough neighborhood, where he learned early on how to navigate crime-ridden streets. He might have been influenced by his father, who was also involved in law enforcement.
* His relationship with Maria Rosa: While the story doesn't delve too deeply into their history, it's likely that Arend and Maria Rosa developed a strong bond during her investigation into her sister's disappearance. She may be one of his first (and closest) clients outside of mainstream authorities.
