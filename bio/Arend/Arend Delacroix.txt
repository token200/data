Here is a summary of Arend Delacroix's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arend Delacroix is a cunning and charismatic individual with a silver tongue. He is quick-witted and able to think on his feet, which has helped him evade capture not once, but twice. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a deeply passionate and principled person who will stop at nothing to protect those in need. Arend is driven by a sense of justice and is willing to take risks to expose the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend Delacroix stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often mussed, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that adds to his air of mystery. He has a lean, athletic build, honed from years of navigating the city's underworld.

**Interests:** Apart from his work as a smuggler and investigator, Arend Delacroix is deeply passionate about music. He plays the guitar in his spare time and often uses music to unwind after a long day of dealing with corruption and danger. Arend also has a love for French literature, particularly the works of Baudelaire and Verlaine, which he finds provides insight into the human condition. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners and alleys, searching for new leads and clues in his investigations.

It's worth noting that these details are not explicitly mentioned in the original short story, but they can be inferred from Arend's actions and personality traits.
