Since Arend Hao is not a known fictional character, I'll create a summary based on your request. Here's a potential profile:

**Physical Attributes:**
Arend Hao stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are an striking shade of indigo, a rare eye color that sets him apart from most people. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Arend Hao is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a sharp mind. He's fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. As a result, he can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, once you gain his trust, he becomes fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect the people he cares about.

**Interests:**
Arend Hao is an avid reader and collector of rare books. He has a particular fascination with ancient mythology and folklore, often losing himself in tales of magic and adventure. When not reading or exploring new places, he enjoys practicing martial arts and playing the guitar. Despite his tough exterior, Arend Hao has a soft spot for children's literature and can often be found reading to local kids at a nearby library.
