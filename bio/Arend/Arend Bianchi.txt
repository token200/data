Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Arend Bianchi:

**Personality:** Arend is a man of few words, with a rugged beauty that commands attention without ever seeming to ask for it. He has a quiet and introspective nature, haunted by the memories of his past as a soldier in the Great War. Despite this, he is deeply compassionate and empathetic, particularly towards children and those who need kindness and understanding.

**Physical Attributes:** Arend is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, with a ruggedly handsome appearance that reflects his years of experience in battle. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm), with broad shoulders and a strong build, hinting at his military background. His eye color is unknown, but it can be inferred from the description of the girl's sparkling eyes as "diamonds in the morning light." Arend's hair is dark brown, likely cut short to keep him out of his face while fighting.

**Interests:** Arend finds solace in nature and quiet pursuits, often taking walks through the village or sitting by the river to clear his mind. He enjoys listening to stories and laughter, particularly from children, which brings a sense of joy and connection to his life. He is also drawn to creative expressions like art and crafts, as demonstrated by the wooden carving made by the young girl he befriends.

**Additional Details:** Arend's past as a soldier has left him with physical scars, but it's unclear how many or where exactly they are located. The text mentions that "the world had moved on without him" after his return from war, suggesting that Arend feels like an outsider in his own community and is struggling to adjust to civilian life.

Overall, Arend Bianchi appears to be a complex character with a rich emotional landscape, driven by a desire for connection and redemption. His encounters with the young girl bring about a transformative change, helping him to find purpose and meaning in his life once again.
