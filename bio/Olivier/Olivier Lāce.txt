Here is a summary of Olivier Lāce's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olivier Lāce, known as "The Ghost," is a master thief and assassin who has honed his skills to survive on the streets. He is cunning, resourceful, and always on the lookout for the next challenge. With a nickname that implies he operates outside of the law, Olivier has developed a reputation for being elusive and unpredictable. Despite this, there is an air of mystery surrounding him, suggesting that there may be more to his character than meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Olivier stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), with an athletic build honed from years of living on the streets. His eyes are a piercing brown, and his dark hair is often worn messy and unkempt. He has a scattering of scars across his face and arms, souvenirs from past encounters.

**Interests:** Olivier's interests revolve around the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of outsmarting his opponents. As a thief and assassin, he takes great pleasure in evading capture and staying one step ahead of those who seek to bring him down. He is also intrigued by the art of deception and misdirection, often using these skills to manipulate others and achieve his goals.

Outside of his work, Olivier seems to have little interest in hobbies or leisure activities, preferring instead to focus on honing his craft and staying adaptable in a world where loyalty is a luxury no one can afford. However, with Colette's enigmatic presence in his life, it seems that there may be more to his character than meets the eye - perhaps even a hint of vulnerability or curiosity lurking beneath his tough exterior.
