Here is a summary of Olivier Kami≈Ñska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Jet black
* Build: Slender with a lean physique, likely due to years of sitting at a desk

**Personality:**

Olivier is an introverted and intense individual who is deeply focused on his work. He has a sharp mind and a keen eye for detail, which serves him well in his career as an architect. However, this focus comes at the cost of social connections and personal relationships. Olivier can come across as gruff or dismissive to those outside of his professional circle, but deep down he is driven by a desire for perfection and a need for control. He has a strong sense of loyalty to his clients and will go to great lengths to deliver high-quality work.

**Interests:**

* Architecture and design (of course!)
* Reading about art, history, and science
* Collecting rare design books and publications
* Traveling to explore new cities and cultures
* Espresso (he loves his espresso machine almost as much as he loves his coffee)

Olivier's interests outside of work are relatively limited due to his intense focus on his craft. However, when given the opportunity, he is curious and enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and experiences. His conversation with his mother suggests that he has a desire for balance and fulfillment in his life, and is open to making changes to achieve this.

As Olivier begins to rebuild his life after his mother's visit, we can expect him to explore new interests and hobbies outside of work. He may take up art or photography, travel to new destinations, or become more involved in his community. Whatever the case, it's clear that he is looking for a sense of purpose and fulfillment beyond just his professional pursuits.
