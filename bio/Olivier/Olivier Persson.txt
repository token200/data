Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Olivier Persson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olivier Persson is an enigmatic figure known for his calm reserve. He comes across as reclusive and prefers to keep to himself, only sharing his art with those he trusts. Despite this, he is deeply passionate about his craft and has a profound sense of compassion and care. Once trust is gained, he can be warm and engaging, sharing intimate stories about his art.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue

**Interests:** Olivier Persson's primary interest is his art. He is a child prodigy with an exceptional talent for painting, and his works are highly sought after by collectors. He spends most of his time in his studio, pouring his heart and soul into every detail of each piece. He also has a deep love for the emotional and psychological depth that can be explored through art.

It's worth noting that while Olivier's physical attributes are not extensively detailed in the original story, I have used my own creative judgment to fill in some gaps based on common depictions of artists as being slender and introspective figures.
