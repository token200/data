Here's a summary of Olivier Dolera's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Olivier appears to be a romantic at heart, with a deep affection for the city of Paris and its cultural heritage. She values close relationships, particularly friendships like her one with Sophie, and is not afraid to show her emotions. Her past experiences have made her introspective and perhaps a bit wistful, but she is also determined to move forward and make the most of new opportunities.

**Physical Attributes:** Olivier's physical attributes are not explicitly stated in the story, but we can infer some details from the narrative. She is likely a woman of average height, possibly around 5'6" (168 cm) or slightly taller. Her eye color is also mentioned, although it's not specified - let's assume she has bright blue eyes, reminiscent of her connection to the city of Paris.

**Interests:** Olivier's interests seem to be centered around art, literature, and music. She was drawn to exploring the Latin Quarter with friends on lazy Sundays, and the mention of Caf√© de Flore suggests a fondness for intellectual pursuits and cultural experiences. Her enthusiasm for jazz music and the mention of freshly baked croissants also suggest a love for simple pleasures in life.

In terms of other interests, Olivier's passion for her past life in Paris is evident, but it's unclear what specific activities or hobbies she might enjoy now that she's living in Saint-Pierre. However, with Sophie's encouragement to return to Paris, we can assume that Olivier may be open to exploring new creative outlets or rekindling old passions in the city of love and light.
