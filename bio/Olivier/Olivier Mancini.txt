Here's a summary of Olivier Mancini's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Olivier is known for his quick wit and sharp tongue, which can sometimes get him into trouble. However, when it comes to sharing his love of wine with others, he has a charming and knowledgeable demeanor that leaves customers in awe. Despite his polished exterior, Olivier's past loss has left an emotional scar, making him guarded around new people. He is vulnerable but also authentic, as seen in his conversation with Luna.

**Physical Attributes:** Olivier stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often perfectly styled, and his sharp jawline adds to his handsome appearance. He has a lean build from years of exercise, honed from working as a sommelier.

**Interests:** Wine, of course, is Olivier's first love. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of varietals and can effortlessly pair even the most obscure wines with intricate descriptions. He is also passionate about art, literature, and old movies. When he's not working at the high-end wine bar, you might find him reading poetry or browsing through antique shops for rare wine-related artifacts.

Olivier's love of travel and adventure is evident in his desire to join Luna on a road trip through Tuscany. This chance encounter may be just what he needs to heal, rediscover himself, and explore new horizons beyond the confines of his past loss.
