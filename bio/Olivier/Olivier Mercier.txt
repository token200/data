**Interests:**

Olivier Mercier has a deep appreciation for art, particularly the works of Monet and other masters. He is fascinated by puzzles, riddles, and cryptography, often using these skills to outwit his opponents. When not engaged in high-stakes heists or negotiating with museum curators, Olivier enjoys fine dining, wine tastings, and long conversations with fellow intellectuals.
