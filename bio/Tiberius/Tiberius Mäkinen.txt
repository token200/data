Here is a summary of Tiberius Mäkinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Tiberius Mäkinen is a man in his mid-40s with an unassuming presence. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic build that suggests a disciplined lifestyle. His hair is dark brown, often neatly trimmed to hide his forehead and temples, which are lined with deep creases from years of concentrating on the task at hand. His eyes are a piercing blue, often narrowed slightly as if perpetually alert for potential threats. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a past injury.

**Personality:**
Tiberius is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and an air of quiet confidence. He exudes a sense of self-reliance, having spent years honing his skills as a spy to survive in the world of espionage. His wit is sharp, but he uses it sparingly, preferring to let his actions speak louder than his words. Despite his tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and introspection beneath the surface, suggesting a deep emotional well that has been left unexplored for too long.

**Interests:**
Tiberius' interests revolve around the quiet, peaceful life he's built in rural Finland. He enjoys sipping coffee on a cold winter morning, watching the snow fall gently onto the frozen lake outside his cabin window. He collects artifacts from his past life, each one serving as a reminder of a particular mission or memory. On occasion, he'll indulge in reading a book or listening to classical music, allowing himself to momentarily escape the whispers of his past.

In terms of personal interests, Tiberius is a man of few hobbies, but when he does engage with them, it's often related to surveillance and tracking – likely an inherited skillset from his years working for The Agency.
