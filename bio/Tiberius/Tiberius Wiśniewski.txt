**Physical Attributes:**
Tiberius Wiśniewski stands at an imposing height of 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), with a lean yet athletic build that belies his intelligent and analytical nature. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a world of secrets, and his sharp jawline gives him an air of quiet confidence. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, framing his angular face.

Tiberius is a reserved and introspective individual, preferring the company of books to people. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused on his work, often becoming completely absorbed in the world of numbers and codes.
