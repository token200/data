Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Tiberius Jarv:

**Personality:** Tiberius Jarv is an enigmatic individual with a reserved nature, exuding an air of mystery that surrounds him. He appears to be quiet and unassuming, but his reputation for being ruthless and cunning suggests a sharp mind and quick wit. His ability to stay one step ahead of pursuers implies that he is resourceful and calculating.

**Physical Attributes:** Tiberius Jarv is estimated to be around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with intensity in the dark. His hair is a dark brown color, often kept short and neatly trimmed to avoid drawing attention to himself. He has a lean and athletic build, honed from years of navigating the streets of Ravenshire as a child.

**Interests:** As a master thief, Tiberius's interests revolve around art and antiquities, particularly those that are rare and valuable.

He has a particular affinity for rare inks and writing instruments, often collecting unique examples of each to use as signatures or tokens.

Outside of his love of thievery, Tiberius seems to be a solitary individual with few close relationships or connections to others. His enigmatic nature suggests that he may be driven by personal motivations, possibly related to the whispered legend of granting wishes at the cost of one's freedom.
