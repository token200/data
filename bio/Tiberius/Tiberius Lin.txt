Here is a summary of Tiberius Lin's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tiberius Lin is a brilliant and eccentric scientist with a passion for discovery. He has a habit of talking to himself, often shouting orders at his equipment or muttering "Ah ha!" when a breakthrough is made. Despite his intense focus on his work, he is not immune to emotions and can be swayed by a glimmer of understanding from someone as intelligent as Dr. Maria Rodriguez.

**Physical Attributes:** Tiberius Lin stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an unassuming build, which belies his extraordinary intellect. His wild shock of white hair is one of his most distinctive features, often escaping his attempts to tame it with a comb or tie. He wears spectacles perched on the end of his nose, giving him a slightly absent-minded appearance. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue that sparkle with excitement when discussing his latest discoveries.

**Interests:** Tiberius Lin is obsessed with understanding the mysteries of the universe, particularly in the realm of quantum physics. He spends most of his days tinkering with miniature black hole generators and scribbling equations on chalkboards. His true passion lies in harnessing the energy of black holes to create sustainable power sources for humanity, which he hopes to achieve through his "Elysium" project. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Tiberius Lin has a fascination with vintage gadgets, antique books, and other esoteric curiosities that fill his cluttered laboratory.

It is worth noting that the text only mentions Dr. Maria Rodriguez's rivalry with Tiberius Lin, but not much about her personality or interests beyond being an arch-rival in their field of quantum physics.
