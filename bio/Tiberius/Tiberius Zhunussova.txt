Here's a summary of Tiberius Zhunussova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tiberius is a complex and enigmatic individual with a dry, subtle sense of humor. He is guarded and private, preferring to keep his emotions and experiences hidden from the world. Despite this, he has a deep understanding of human nature and is able to connect with others on a profound level, as evidenced by his willingness to share fragments of his own life with Ava Morales.

**Physical Attributes:** Tiberius stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an unassuming presence that belies his inner complexity. His eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, a deep, rich color that seems almost otherworldly in its intensity. His skin is pale and gaunt, giving him a fragile appearance that is not entirely deceiving.

**Interests:** Tiberius's interests are multifaceted and deeply personal. He is drawn to the stories of others, particularly those who have lived complex, often painful lives. He collects trinkets and tokens from these individuals, which he displays in his wooden box, each item holding a unique story or memory. In addition to this fascination with human experience, Tiberius appears to have an affinity for music, as evidenced by the rhythmic hum that emanates from his apartment when Ava arrives.

It's worth noting that Tiberius's past is shrouded in mystery, and it's possible that his interests and personality traits are shaped by his experiences as a former soldier or master thief. However, the only concrete details provided about these aspects of his life come from rumors and speculation, leaving much to be discovered about this enigmatic individual.
