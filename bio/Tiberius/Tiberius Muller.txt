**Personality:** Tiberius Muller is an enigmatic and introspective individual with an air of quiet confidence. He is fiercely independent and prefers solitude to social interactions, making him appear aloof to those who do not know him. However, he possesses a warm and insightful nature, which is revealed through his gentle smile and thoughtful words.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: His eye color is described as having "fringes," suggesting that he has a pair of glasses perched on the end of his nose. It can be inferred that his eyes are likely blue or grey, given the contrast with the glasses.

**Interests:** Muller's primary interest lies in collecting and studying rare books, particularly those related to ancient civilizations, cryptography, and forgotten mythologies. He is an expert in these fields and spends most of his time surrounded by his vast collection of artifacts and texts. His fascination with language patterns and codes led him to write "De Verbis Antiquis," a text that has become one of his most obscure works.

This affinity for language and aesthetics suggests that he may also have an appreciation for art, music, or other creative expressions.
