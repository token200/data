**Personality:** Tiberius is a man with an extraordinary sense of timelessness, which some might interpret as a peculiarity or an inability to conform. He has a unique perspective on the world, often getting lost in the intricate dance of mechanisms and finding beauty in contraptions that others might not appreciate. This ability to see beyond the ordinary suggests that Tiberius is a creative and introspective individual.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no explicit details about Tiberius's physical appearance in the provided text. However, I will make some educated assumptions based on his character:

* **Height:** 5'8" (172 cm) - This height seems plausible for a clockmaker's apprentice who spends most of his time working with intricate mechanisms.
* **Eye Color:** Blue or grey eyes - These colors seem fitting for someone who is often lost in thought and finds beauty in the intricacies of machines.
* **Hair:** Dark brown, unkempt hair that frames his face - This hairstyle suggests a somewhat introverted personality and an ability to focus on more important things than external appearances.

**Interests:**

* **Clockmaking**: Tiberius's passion for clockmaking is evident throughout the story. He spends most of his waking hours working with gears and springs, which indicates that this skill is deeply ingrained in him.
* **Intricate mechanisms**: His ability to find beauty in complex machinery suggests that he is drawn to patterns, structure, and symmetry.
* **Timekeeping**: The story implies that Tiberius has a peculiar relationship with time. He seems to perceive it as fluid and malleable, which may suggest an interest in the concept of time itself.

Overall, Tiberius appears to be a creative, introspective individual who is deeply passionate about clockmaking and intricate mechanisms. His experience with Sophia and the pocket watch suggests that he may have a hidden talent for creating something magical, but at what cost?
