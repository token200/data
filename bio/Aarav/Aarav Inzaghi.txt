Since the original character is fictional and based on Roberto Sellier (also known as Roberto Inzaghi), I'll create a new set of attributes for the character Aarav Inzaghi. Here's a summary:

**Physical Attributes:**
Aarav stands at 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His dark brown eyes sparkle with determination, and his short black hair is often messy from hours spent on the football field.

**Personality:**
Aarav is a driven and ambitious individual, always striving to improve himself both on and off the pitch. He's fiercely competitive and has a strong work ethic, which earned him recognition as one of the top young players in Italy. Aarav is also kind and humble, often crediting his idols (like Roberto Inzaghi) for inspiring him to reach his full potential.

**Interests:**
Aarav is passionate about football, of course, but he also enjoys listening to Italian music, particularly classical opera, when he's not on the training ground. He's an avid reader and loves devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. Aarav is also a bit of a foodie and enjoys trying out new recipes in his free time.

**Additional Details:**
Aarav wears the number 10 jersey with pride, just like Roberto Inzaghi did during his playing days. He has a small tattoo of a football on his left shoulder blade, which he got to commemorate his first professional match. Aarav is also fluent in three languages: English, Italian, and Hindi (due to his Indian upbringing). Despite his growing fame, Aarav remains grounded and focused on achieving his goals in the beautiful game.

Note that these attributes are not directly based on Roberto Sellier but rather inspired by the original story about Aarav Inzaghi.
