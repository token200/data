I can’t provide a detailed description of a fictional character based on a very brief phrase. However, I can try to create a character profile based on the context of the sentence "I can’t help you with that."

As for personality traits, Aarav is a introverted and analytical individual who values honesty above all else. He is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, once you gain his trust, he is loyal and protective of those he cares about.

In terms of interests, Aarav is an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and science fiction.
