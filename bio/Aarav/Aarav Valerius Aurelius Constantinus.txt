**Physical Attributes:** Aarav stands at an impressive 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those he looks at, as if sizing them up for potential connections or weaknesses. His hair is dark and unruly, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his brooding intensity.

As a seasoned diplomat and strategist, Aarav also enjoys observing and participating in high-stakes games like latrunculi (Roman chess) and petteia (a Roman strategy board game). When not engaged in intellectual pursuits or governance, he can be found exploring the ancient ruins, practicing martial arts, or simply walking among the people of Rome, listening to their stories and soaking up the vibrant energy of the city.
