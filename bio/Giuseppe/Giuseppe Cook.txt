* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into the pages of ancient texts.
* Hair: Giuseppe's hair is dark brown and unruly, often falling across his forehead in wisps. He doesn't bother much with it, preferring to let it grow out.
* Build: Giuseppe has a slender build, which allows him to move quickly through crowded spaces. His eyes are often fixed on the horizon, lost in thought.
