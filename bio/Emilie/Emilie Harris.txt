Here's a summary of Emilie Harris' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Emilie Harris is a warm, vibrant, and resilient individual with a quick wit and a heart of gold. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray animals, children, and anyone in need of comfort. She's a natural people person who thrives on social interaction, but also values her alone time with Max, her loyal terrier companion.

**Physical Attributes:** Emilie stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with long, curly brown hair that often escapes her ponytail when she's busy baking. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with warmth and kindness, putting even the most skeptical customers at ease. She has a petite nose ring and a few scattered freckles across her cheeks, which add to her wholesome charm.

**Interests:** Emilie is passionate about baking, cooking, and trying out new recipes. She's always experimenting with flavors and ingredients to create innovative pastries that delight her customers. When she's not in the bakery, you can find her volunteering at the local animal shelter, caring for strays and advocating for animal welfare. She's also an avid reader of cookbooks, food blogs, and romance novels (her guilty pleasure).
