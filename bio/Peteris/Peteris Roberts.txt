Peteris Roberts has spent years honing his skills as a journalist and detective, working for various newspapers and private clients. He's built a reputation for being one of the most talented and tenacious investigators in the city, but remains elusive and private about his personal life.

His passion for uncovering hidden truths drives him to continually push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom.
