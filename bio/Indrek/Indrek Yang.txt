**Personality:** Indrek is a quiet and reserved individual who keeps to himself most of the time. He is introspective and emotionally guarded, having been shattered by tragedy in his past. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. His methods are often unorthodox and extreme, but his results speak for themselves.

**Physical Attributes:** Indrek stands at 5'10" with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of intense physical activity while working on his serum. His eyes gleam with an intensity that few notice, shining a piercing blue-gray color that seems almost otherworldly in the right light.

**Interests:** Indrek's interests are largely centered around his work as a scientist and a vigilante. He is deeply fascinated by the concept of time manipulation and its potential applications. He spends countless hours studying ancient texts and researching forgotten knowledge, seeking to understand the limits of his powers and how to control them.

As Nightwalker, he has a particular interest in justice and protecting those who are vulnerable. His experiences have left him with a deep-seated need for control and order, which drives him to seek out cases where the law is insufficient or corrupt.

Despite his tough exterior, Indrek has a soft spot for children and the innocent, whom he feels compelled to safeguard from harm. He finds solace in watching over them, knowing that even small acts of kindness can have a profound impact on their lives.

In private moments, Indrek might enjoy reading or listening to classical music, seeking comfort in the beauty and order of the world around him.
