Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Indrek Varga:

**Personality:** Indrek Varga is a reclusive sorcerer with an unyielding resolve. He carries the weight of his family's legacy on his shoulders, which has made him cautious and guarded. However, when he meets Eira, he begins to show a more vulnerable side, revealing a spark of hope that perhaps he isn't alone in this world after all. Despite his tough exterior, Indrek is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue (although it's hinted that he may have other eye colors or shades, as the story mentions piercing green eyes belonging to Eira)
* Hair Color: Dark brown or black, which is not mentioned in the original text
* Build: Indrek is likely lean and athletic, given his ability as a sorcerer and his willingness to take risks.

**Interests:** As a sorcerer, Indrek's primary interest lies in mastering his magical abilities and understanding the prophecy that surrounds him. He is particularly drawn to studying the elements and learning how to wield their power. Additionally, he has a strong sense of justice and is willing to help those who are innocent and being exploited.

It's worth noting that the original text doesn't provide much information about Indrek Varga's interests beyond his connection to the prophecy. However, based on the story, it seems that his primary interest lies in protecting himself and others from those who seek to exploit their powers.
