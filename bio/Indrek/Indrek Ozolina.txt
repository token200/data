Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Indrek Ozolina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Indrek is a fierce and determined individual with a strong sense of rivalry and competitiveness. She is confident in her abilities as a skilled sea witch and captain of the "Maelstrom's Revenge", but also acknowledges that she must constantly improve to stay ahead of her opponents. Her fiery temper and sharp tongue suggest that she can be fiercely passionate, but also intelligent and calculating.

**Physical Attributes:** Indrek is described as standing atop a windswept hill with raven-black hair whipping about her face. Given this context, it's likely that she has long, dark hair. Unfortunately, there isn't any information on her eye color or height in the provided story, so I will make some assumptions based on common stereotypes for a sea witch: Let's assume Indrek has piercing blue eyes to contrast with her dark hair and an athletic build suited for navigating the waves.

**Interests:** As a skilled sea witch and captain of the "Maelstrom's Revenge", Indrek is deeply invested in mastering the arcane arts, especially those related to the ocean and its magical properties. She appears to have a strong interest in outwitting her rival, Zorvath, and demonstrating her superiority in magical prowess.

It's also possible that Indrek enjoys spending time on the high seas, commanding her ship, and navigating the complex world of sea magic. Her rivalry with Zorvath suggests that she may have a competitive streak and is drawn to challenges that test her abilities and knowledge.
