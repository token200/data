Here is a summary of Indrek Altmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Indrek stands at 5'10" with an athletic yet lean build, honed from years of navigating the rooftops and alleys of London. His hair is dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his early escapades as a thief.

**Personality:** Indrek is a master manipulator, able to effortlessly weave webs of deception and charm his way out of sticky situations. Despite his reputation as a con artist, he has a code of honor that guides his actions, always prioritizing targets who can afford to lose their valuables without suffering dire consequences. He is fiercely intelligent, quick-witted, and always thinking several steps ahead of his adversaries. However, Indrek's greatest weakness may be his tendency to trust others too readily – as evidenced by his encounter with Victor.

**Interests:** As a seasoned thief and con artist, Indrek's interests lie in the art of deception itself. He takes great pleasure in outsmarting his marks and staying one step ahead of his pursuers. He is also an avid collector of rare artifacts and curiosities, often using these to inform his next big score. In his free time, Indrek enjoys indulging in fine wine, luxury fabrics, and high-end fashion – all a testament to his refined taste and sophistication.

It's worth noting that while Indrek has many talents and skills, he is not without his vulnerabilities. His complicated past with Victor, combined with the strain of constantly staying ahead of his adversaries, may be starting to take its toll on his mental and physical health. Only time will tell if Indrek Altmann can continue to navigate the treacherous underworld of London with ease, or if his luck is finally running out.
