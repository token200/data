Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Indrek Webb's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm), which would make him significantly above average height.
- Eye Color: An unsettling shade of indigo or a deep blue, hinting at his mysterious nature.

**Personality:**
Indrek Webb appears to be an enigmatic and elusive individual. He is known for being evasive in interviews, preferring to leave others with fragmented clues about his life and motivations. This suggests that he values control over the narrative and prefers not to reveal too much about himself. Despite this reclusive nature, Indrek is clearly a creative force to be reckoned with, able to tap into the human psyche and craft tales that defy categorization.

**Interests:**
It can be inferred from the text that Indrek Webb has an intense fascination with the darker aspects of human psychology, which he uses as inspiration for his works. This allows him to distill the deepest, darkest recesses of the human mind into compelling narratives. His love for rare volumes and dusty artifacts suggests a deep interest in history, mystery, and perhaps even the occult.

Additionally, Indrek's ability to access surreal dreams as a child might imply that he has a strong connection to his subconscious or a heightened sense of intuition, which fuels his creative process. This could be further hinted at by the notion that his stories have taken on a life of their own, coalescing into manifestations of some unseen force.
