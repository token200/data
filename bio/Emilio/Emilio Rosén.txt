Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Emilio Rosén's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Emilio Rosén is likely a medium to tall stature individual. As he stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, he had to "step" into a new era in life (pun intended) suggesting that height was not as imposing on him. His eye color is unknown, but it can be inferred that his eyes are probably hazel or brown given his age of 40.

**Personality:**
Emilio Rosén appears to be introspective and reflective, haunted by memories of the past. He has a deep sense of nostalgia for his hometown, where he had shared dreams with friends and musicians, but he struggled to find success in the city. Despite all his accomplishments, Emilio yearned for something more, which was still unfulfilled, as hinted by him returning home. This introspection might suggest that he is a thoughtful person with self-awareness.

**Interests:**
Emilio's artistic and musical background from his youth remains relevant to this day. He has likely continued to create art or pursue some other creative outlet in life. Although the text does not explicitly state it, music may also be an interest of Emilio Rosén given that "a group of artists and musicians" were part of his circle back then.

Emilio's artistic side suggests he is imaginative, possibly a poet at heart (unwritten details on any poetic skills). His experiences in life have likely shaped his perspective on relationships (family members), loss, home. Emilio may be someone who values simplicity over urbanization or noise, with his ability to find solace in quiet surroundings hinting that solitude and connection could be areas he finds value.

It is also worth noting that there may be emotional undertones of what it might mean for him to return home as a grown adult after years away.
