Based on the provided short story, it appears that Halima is a seasoned journalist with a strong instinct for sniffing out big stories. She has a keen eye for detail and is not afraid to take risks to get the scoop. Despite her tough exterior, she also has a compassionate side and is able to connect with people from all walks of life.

As a result, I imagine Halima as someone who is fiercely independent and self-motivated, but also values her relationships and connections with others. She is likely someone who enjoys being alone with her thoughts, but also appreciates the company of like-minded individuals who share her passion for uncovering the truth.
