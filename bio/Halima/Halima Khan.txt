She struggles with trusting others and expecting nothing but rejection from people she meets. However, after reconnecting with Amira, she begins to open up and experience emotions she thought were long buried. She is fiercely independent and self-reliant, having grown up on the streets of Karachi, but also has a deep desire for belonging and connection.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown with flecks of gold
* Hair Color: Black, often styled in a short pixie cut

**Interests:** Halima's past experiences have made her wary of intimacy and attachment. However, as she spends more time with Amira, she begins to reveal her passions and interests:

* She has a love for Sufi music and poetry, which is evident during their rooftop cafe visit.
* Her connection to the city of Karachi runs deep, with memories of late-night strolls along the beach and sleepless nights in cramped alleyways still etched in her mind.
* She enjoys dancing and moving to the rhythm of Sufi melodies.

It's also implied that Halima has a strong interest in exploring her heritage and reconnecting with her roots, which is evident in Amira's handmade handicrafts and their conversations about family history.
