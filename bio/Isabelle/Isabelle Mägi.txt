Based on the short story, here is a summary of Isabelle MÃ¤gi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Isabelle appears to be introspective and nostalgic, with a deep emotional connection to her hometown of Tartu. She seems to have experienced a sense of loss and disconnection in her life, particularly following the passing of her mother. However, upon returning to Tartu, she shows a renewed sense of purpose and belonging. Her interactions with Aigi, her childhood friend, suggest that she is warm-hearted, empathetic, and values close relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** 

- **Height:** Isabelle is likely around 5'7" (170 cm), as this is a common height for many Estonians.
- **Eye Color:** She has blue eyes, which is a common eye color in Estonia.

**Interests:**

Isabelle's interests seem to revolve around art and creativity. As mentioned in the story, she had pursued a degree in art and was successful in Berlin, suggesting that she is skilled and passionate about her craft. Her desire to return to Tartu and reconnect with her past also implies that she values her connection to her hometown and its people.

It can be inferred that Isabelle's artistic pursuits are closely tied to her sense of identity and belonging. Her time spent in Berlin may have brought her personal and professional success, but it also created a disconnect from her roots. Upon returning to Tartu, she seems to be seeking a more balanced life that incorporates both her artistic ambitions and her connection to her hometown.

Given the background of this story, it is reasonable to assume Isabelle's love for nature and exploration, which can be gathered from sentences like "she'd spent exploring the woods and fields just outside the town" in the initial passage.
