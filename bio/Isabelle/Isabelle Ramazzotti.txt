Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Isabelle Ramazzotti:

**Personality:** Isabelle is a driven and intensely focused individual. Her passion for art history, particularly 19th-century Italian painting, is all-consuming, often leading her to neglect other aspects of her life. She is fiercely intelligent and has a keen eye for detail, which serves her well in her research and artistic pursuits. Despite her singular focus on Canal's work, Isabelle appears to be a romantic at heart, captivated by the idea that she shares an inexplicable connection with the Venetian master.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often pulled back into a loose bun or worn in a stylish updo
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a subtle golden glow from spending time outdoors
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, a small nose, and full lips that curve into a determined smile

**Interests:** 

* Art History, particularly 19th-century Italian painting
* Researching and discovering new information about Giovanni Antonio Canal (Canal) and other artists of his time

* Reading literature and philosophy to broaden her understanding of the cultural context surrounding her research
* Collecting art-related books, letters, and documents from the Ramazzotti family archives
* Painting and creating her own works in an attempt to recreate Canal's lost portrait

It is worth noting that Isabelle's intense focus on her work and her relationships with others can be both a strength and a weakness. Her drive is what propels her forward, but it also puts a strain on those around her, leading to moments of isolation and frustration.
