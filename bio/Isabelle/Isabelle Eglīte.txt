**Personality:**

Isabelle Eglīte is a master of deception and manipulation. She is a chameleon who can effortlessly adapt to different situations and personas, making it difficult for others to discern her true intentions. Despite her skillful facade, she feels lost and alone, struggling with the weight of her past experiences and the fragility of human loyalty. Isabelle has a tendency to trust no one, leading her to rely on her own wits and resourcefulness to survive in a world where trust is a luxury few can afford.
