Here's a summary of Mattia Fliesbach's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mattia is an enigmatic figure with a strong desire for human connection despite being ostracized by his peers. He is resilient, brave, and resourceful, often putting himself in harm's way to help others. His introverted nature allows him to observe and listen, which helps him form deep bonds with those around him. Mattia has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but he remains kind-hearted and empathetic towards those who need his assistance.

**Physical Attributes:** Mattia stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build, typical of someone who spends time flying through the air. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost purple in hue, which seem to sparkle with mischief when he's excited or interested. His wings sprouting from his back are long and slender, resembling those of a bat, with delicate membranes that shimmer in shades of iridescent blue.

**Interests:** Mattia has a passion for flying, which stems from both necessity (to escape ridicule) and pure joy. He enjoys exploring new heights and experiencing the thrill of weightlessness. In his free time, he appreciates innovative gadgets and contraptions, often collaborating with Lysander to create extraordinary aerial devices. Music is another interest of Mattia's; Ruby, the mystical performer, has taught him various forms of vocal improvisation that allow him to express himself in new ways.

In terms of hobbies, Mattia also enjoys reading poetry, particularly those written by Kaida, which often reflect his own experiences with isolation and belonging. He finds solace in the words and emotions conveyed through these pieces, and they serve as a reminder of the beauty that can be found in unexpected places.

Lastly, Mattia values self-discovery and exploration, constantly seeking to understand his unique abilities and how they fit into the world around him. Through this journey of self-awareness, he hopes to inspire others who may feel like outcasts or misfits to find their own paths to acceptance and belonging.
