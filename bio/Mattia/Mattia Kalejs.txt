I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mattia Kalejs. It's possible that this character was created for a specific story or context that I'm not aware of.

However, based on the quote "The other details seem to be consistent," I can try to create a short summary about Mattia Kalejs using general personality and physical attribute profiles that are commonly associated with fictional characters.

Here's a possible summary:

Mattia Kalejs is a 25-year-old male character with an athletic build and stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall. He has piercing blue eyes and dark brown hair that falls to his shoulders. His personality is often described as charming, confident, and calculating. As someone who values intelligence and strategy, Mattia is a natural problem-solver and can come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him.

Mattia's interests include strategic games like chess and Risk, reading historical fiction novels, and practicing martial arts. He enjoys spending time alone, whether it's hiking in the woods or exploring new cities, and values his independence above all else.

Please note that this is just a fictional profile based on general characteristics, and there may be more to Mattia Kalejs than what's presented here.
