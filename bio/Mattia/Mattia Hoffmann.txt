His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost black, which seems to sparkle with curiosity when he's intensely focused on his work. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that contrasts with his sharp intellect.

He has an insatiable curiosity about the universe and its secrets, which fuels his passion for discovery. His colleagues often remark on his ability to see connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, making him a valuable asset in the scientific community.

Despite his immense success, Mattia remains humble and grounded, never losing sight of his original motivations. He is fiercely independent and values autonomy above all else, often taking risks that others might deem foolhardy. However, this independence also makes him fiercely loyal to those he considers friends and colleagues.

Mattia also has a secret passion – ancient languages and mythology. The mysterious stranger who visited him with the ancient text sparked a renewed interest in these subjects, and he now devotes a significant amount of time to studying and interpreting ancient texts.

In his younger years, Mattia was an avid stargazer, spending countless nights gazing up at the stars and dreaming of what lay beyond our planet. This love for the night sky has only grown stronger with age, driving him to continue pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
