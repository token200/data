His introverted personality allows him to observe the world around him with great attention, noticing details that others might miss. He is also deeply curious about the human experience and the secrets that lie beyond the veil of reality.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)

**Interests:** Mattia's primary interest is shadow puppetry, an ancient art form that he has mastered over the years. He finds solace in creating intricate silhouettes on a wooden screen, using candlelight to imbue depth and emotion into his performances. His work allows him to tap into the mystical and mysterious aspects of human experience.

Outside of his craft, Mattia is also fascinated by mythology and folklore, often weaving these themes into his shadow puppet shows. He has a deep appreciation for nature and the natural world, spending hours tending to his family's vineyard under the sun-kissed vines.

His unique perspective on life has earned him the title of "master of shadows" among those who know him, but his true self is one of quiet contemplation and introspection.
