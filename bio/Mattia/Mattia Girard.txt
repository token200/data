Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Mattia Girard's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Mattia appears to be a introverted person who has built walls around himself due to past pain. However, as he forms connections with others at Le Coeur du Port, he begins to open up and let his guard down. He is curious and wary at the same time, reflecting his native North region's influence. Despite being guarded initially, Mattia shows a capacity for healing and finding solace in new relationships.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark Brown
Additional Details: Given that Mattia is described as stepping off the train onto a "worn platform", it suggests he may have rougher, more weathered skin from his time spent outside. It's also possible he has some noticeable physical scars or marks that hint at his past struggles.

Interests:
- Exploring new places and cities
- Immersing himself in different cultures (as evident by moving to Le Havre)
- Connecting with people through shared stories, music, or art
- Seeking solace and healing from painful experiences
