**Physical Attributes:** Matteo stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, likely honed from years of sailing. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, reminiscent of the Scandinavian winter sky. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his weathered skin.

Matteo is also a good listener, often engaging in lively conversations with his crewmates and friends. He's got a dry sense of humor, but it's not something you'd catch on the surface - it takes getting to know him.

**Interests:** Matteo's passion lies at sea, where he finds solace and freedom. As a sailboat captain, he loves navigating the Øresund Strait, exploring hidden coves and fjords with friends. When not on the water, Matteo enjoys sipping tea in his apartment, watching the city come alive outside his window. He's an enthusiast of sailing techniques and spends hours discussing the finer points with Kristian. On land, he finds inspiration in street performers, cafes, and the artistic expressions of the city.
