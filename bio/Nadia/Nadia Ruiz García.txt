Despite this, she was fiercely determined and driven by a desperate need for forgiveness.

* Eye Color: Dark Brown - a deep, rich shade that seemed to hold a world of sorrow within its depths.
* Hair: Long, Dark Brown - often unkempt and wild, reflecting Nadia's chaotic emotional state.

**Interests:**

Nadia's interests were largely centered around her family and her own personal demons. She was drawn to the mysteries of death, grief, and the supernatural, often finding solace in the company of ghosts and spirits.
