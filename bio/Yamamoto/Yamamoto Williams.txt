Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Yamamoto Williams' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Yamamoto Williams is known for her calmness under pressure and calculated risk-taking. She is also described as having an uncanny ability to read people and situations, which suggests that she is highly perceptive and strategic in her approach to poker. Despite her tough reputation, she remains humble and true to her roots.

**Physical Attributes:** Yamamoto Williams is a Japanese-American woman, but specific physical details are not provided in the story. However, based on the author's description of her nickname "The Dragon Lady," it can be inferred that she has an imposing presence and may be seen as intimidating by opponents. In terms of height, there is no mention of this detail, so I will arbitrarily assign a height of 5'9" (175 cm) for Yamamoto Williams.

As for eye color, the story does not provide any information about her eyes, so I will also make an assumption and say that she has piercing green eyes, which are often associated with Asian cultures.

**Interests:** It's clear that poker is Yamamoto Williams' primary passion and focus. She has spent years honing her skills and competing at high levels, earning a reputation as one of the greatest players in the game. Her dedication to the craft is evident, and she plays for the thrill of competition rather than just for the money.

Outside of poker, there isn't much information about Yamamoto Williams' personal interests or hobbies. However, given her background growing up surrounded by Los Angeles's vibrant nightlife and underground gaming scenes, it's possible that she enjoys other forms of entertainment or lifestyle activities, such as visiting Asian restaurants or exploring the city's cultural scene.
