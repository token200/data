Based on the short story about Yamamoto Zariņš, here is a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Yamamoto Zariņš is described as having a "gift for capturing the beauty in the mundane world around him," which suggests that he has a creative and curious mind. He is also portrayed as being enthusiastic and open to new experiences, as seen when he stumbles upon the small independent bookstore and decides to help Mrs. Tanaka with her art classes.

Physical Attributes: Yamamoto Zariņš is described as standing out from the crowd due to his unconventional appearance. His messy black hair and vibrant purple suit make him a distinctive figure in Tokyo's bustling streets. Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide information about his height or eye color, so I will make some educated guesses.

Height: Based on his stature in the crowded city streets, it's likely that Zariņš is slightly above average height, around 5'10" to 6'2".

Eye Color: Given his unique and vibrant purple suit, I imagine Zariņš has striking eye colors. Perhaps he has piercing green or blue eyes that complement his bold attire.

Interests: As mentioned in the story, Yamamoto Zariņš's primary interest is art. He spends most of his days wandering the city, observing the world around him, and sketching notes and ideas in his journal. He also develops a passion for teaching others about color theory, composition, and texture when he starts assisting Mrs. Tanaka with her art classes.

Additional interests: It can be inferred that Zariņš has an interest in Japanese culture and nature, given the influence of traditional cherry blossom illustrations on his work and his fascination with exploring the city's neighborhoods and observing everyday life.
