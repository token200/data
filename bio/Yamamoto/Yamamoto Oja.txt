Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Yamamoto Oja:

**Personality:** Yamamoto Oja was known for his intelligence, resourcefulness, and strong sense of justice. Despite growing up in a challenging environment and facing disillusionment with the samurai world, he remained loyal to his lord and continued to serve him faithfully. His experiences led to a deep understanding of the complexities of Japanese politics and a commitment to living a virtuous life.

**Physical Attributes:** Yamamoto Oja is likely to be a tall individual, standing around 5'10" (178 cm) or taller. He has eyes that are a deep brown, reflecting his connection to the natural world and the importance he places on wisdom. His hair may be dark brown or black, worn in a simple yet dignified style. His build is likely athletic, honed from years of training as a samurai.

**Interests:** Yamamoto Oja's interests revolved around philosophy, politics, and spirituality. He was deeply committed to living a virtuous life, guided by his book "Hokushu Hohan," which offered practical advice on how to navigate the complexities of Japanese society. As a writer and contemplative, he spent much of his later years reflecting on the nature of reality and the importance of simplicity and humility.

It's worth noting that Yamamoto Tsunetomo, not Oja, is the actual historical figure who wrote "Hokushu Hohan." However, based on the provided short story, I created a fictional character named Yamamoto Oja to fill in any missing details.
