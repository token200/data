Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aurora Patel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aurora "Rory" Patel is a complex individual with a mix of emotions. On one hand, she has been given everything in life - wealth, influence, and opportunities. This has made her somewhat entitled and disconnected from the struggles of others. However, as revealed through her interactions with Leela, Rory also feels lost and uncertain about her place in the world. She longs for autonomy and a sense of purpose. With Leela's words of wisdom, Rory begins to realize that she is stronger than she thought and has the power to create her own destiny.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide detailed physical attributes for Rory Patel. However, I can make an educated guess based on her cultural background as a child of privilege in Mumbai:

* Height: Average Indian height, around 5'4" (162.56 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or chocolate-brown eyes, which is common among people of Indian descent
* Hair Color: Black, possibly with subtle highlights or undertones

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Rory Patel's interests include:

* Exploring her cultural heritage and connecting with her roots (as seen in her experiences at home)
* Experiencing new things and taking risks (e.g., trying whiskey for the first time)
* Embracing her individuality and breaking free from expectations
* Building strong relationships with close friends, like Leela
* Discovering her own path and creating a brighter future for herself

These interests are likely shaped by Rory's desire to break free from her family's past drama and forge her own identity.
