Here is a summary of Aurora Krūmiņa's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aurora is a complex and introspective individual. She is a natural leader, having reigned as the queen of the Latvian folklore scene for many years, but beneath her confident exterior lies a sense of restlessness and disconnection from the world around her. She is driven by a deep curiosity about the earth's magic and its secrets, which fuels her desire to understand herself and her place in the world. Despite this, she is not one to be swayed by emotions or petty concerns; instead, she approaches challenges with a steady hand and a keen mind.

**Physical Attributes:** Aurora stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an ethereal beauty that belies her regal bearing. Her hair is a striking silver hue, which falls in loose waves down her back like a river of moonlight. Her eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purple in the right light, and seem to hold a world of wisdom within them. Her features are delicate yet refined, with high cheekbones and a small nose that seems almost otherworldly.

**Interests:** Aurora is deeply fascinated by the earth's magic and its secrets. She has spent countless hours listening to tales of ancient gods and mythical creatures from her grandmother, a wise woman who imparted these stories upon her. As queen, she has worked tirelessly to preserve and promote the traditional folklore of Latvian culture, using her own unique connection to the land and its magic to guide her decisions.

However, beyond her official duties, Aurora's true passions lie in music and storytelling. She is an accomplished flute player, able to coax haunting melodies from the ancient wooden instrument that she discovered at the ball. She also has a deep love of myths and legends, which fuels her desire to understand herself and her place within the world.

In addition to these interests, Aurora is also drawn to the mysterious and the unknown. She is often lost in thought, pondering the secrets of the universe and the mysteries that lie beyond the edge of the everyday world. This introspection has led her to develop a strong connection with nature, which she believes holds the key to unlocking her own true power.
