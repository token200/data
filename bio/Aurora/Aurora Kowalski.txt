**Personality:**
Aurora is known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, often able to deftly deflect from sensitive topics or awkward conversations. However, beneath this confident exterior lies a complex and vulnerable soul, prone to anxiety and self-doubt. She has a natural talent for people-pleasing and can sometimes struggle with setting boundaries or asserting herself.

She is drawn to people who challenge her perspectives, push her out of her comfort zone, and encourage her to grow as a person. With the support of loved ones and a growing sense of self-awareness, she is ready to embark on this new chapter of life and be unapologetically herself.
