**Personality:** Aurora is a strong-willed and determined individual with a passion for music. She is unapologetic about her art and isn't afraid to speak her mind. Her powerful voice and stage presence have earned her respect in the underground music scene. However, she also struggles with self-doubt and the pressures of fame, which makes her a complex and relatable character.

**Physical Attributes:** Aurora stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with striking green eyes that seem to sparkle with intensity when she performs on stage. Her dark hair is often styled in a messy, punk-inspired look that frames her heart-shaped face. She has a petite nose ring and a scattering of tattoos, including the small, delicate one on her wrist that was given to her by her late grandmother.

**Interests:** Aurora's primary interest is music, particularly punk rock and alternative genres. She is an avid songwriter and singer-songwriter who pours her emotions and experiences into every lyric. She loves playing guitar, experimenting with new sounds, and pushing the boundaries of her art. When she's not performing or writing music, Aurora enjoys spending time with her friends, family, and pets (she has two rescue cats named Luna and Aria).
