Here is a summary of Aurora Green's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aurora Green is a free-spirited individual with a wild and untamed soul. She has a nomadic heart, always feeling like an outsider until she finds her tribe. Despite her carefree nature, she's had to adapt to the world and find stability, but now at 25, she's starting to feel restless for something more. Aurora is adventurous, fearless, and has a natural sense of curiosity.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Hair: Long, curly brown hair
* Eye Color: Bright blue with golden flecks

**Interests:** Aurora's interests are deeply rooted in her nomadic upbringing and her experiences as a performer. She loves:
* Traveling and exploring new places
* Performing and entertaining others
* Acrobatics and aerial stunts
* Fire-breathing and juggling
* Dancing under the stars
* Meeting new people and making connections

Aurora's interests are not limited to performance, though. She's also curious about the world around her and enjoys learning new skills and exploring different cultures. As she embarks on this new adventure with Luna Nightingale, we can expect Aurora to be open-minded, adaptable, and eager to explore new horizons.

In terms of missing details that were not explicitly stated in the original story, I've added a few: Aurora's physical attributes are now more specific, including her eye color and hair length. Her age is also confirmed as 25 years old.
