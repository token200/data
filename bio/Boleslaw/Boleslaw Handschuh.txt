**Personality:** Boleslaw Handschuh is described as someone who is determined, driven, and passionate about his work. He is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth and shedding light on the hidden secrets of Poland's past. His intense focus and dedication border on obsession, but it is clear that this singular-mindedness stems from a genuine desire for knowledge and understanding.

However, based on his occupation as a journalist and historian, I would imagine him to be of average height, likely in the range of 5'8" to 6'0". His eye color is not specified, but considering his Slavic heritage, it is possible that he has blue or green eyes.

His love for history began at a young age and has only intensified as he pursued his education and career.
