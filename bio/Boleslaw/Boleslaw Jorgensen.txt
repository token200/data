Based on the short story, here's a summary of Boleslaw Jorgensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Boleslaw is an enigmatic figure with a reserved nature, suggesting that he may be introverted or even has a somewhat mysterious past. However, as a freelance journalist, he has developed a keen eye for storytelling and a knack for sniffing out leads, indicating that he's also determined and resourceful. His cautious approach to sharing his personal life with others implies that he might be private about his past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) - This tall stature may contribute to the sense of unease and intimidation that Mrs. Jenkins reported seeing in her property at night.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes - Boleslaw's piercing blue eyes are highlighted when Mrs. Jenkins describes him as having "piercing eyes" lurking around her property.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Boleslaw is clearly interested in investigative journalism and storytelling. He's drawn to the mysterious and unknown, which suggests that he might have an interest in the paranormal or unexplained phenomena (given his investigation into the strange occurrences in Ravenswood). His experience as a journalist has likely honed his analytical skills, allowing him to piece together seemingly unrelated information.

Additional details that can be inferred from the story:

* Age: Late 30s to early 40s - Boleslaw's appearance and demeanor suggest an adult with some life experience, but not necessarily advanced age.
* Hair color: Dark brown or black - There's no explicit mention of his hair color in the story, but it's likely to be dark due to the reserved nature described earlier.
