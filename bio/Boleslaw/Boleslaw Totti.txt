**Personality:** Boleslaw is an intense and focused individual with a passion for discovery that drives him to push beyond the boundaries of conventional thinking. His obsession with understanding the mysterious device led him to become increasingly reclusive, causing concern among his colleagues. Despite this, he remains dedicated to his work, willing to invest countless hours in unraveling the secrets of the device.

**Physical Attributes:** Boleslaw stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His eyes are an intense shade of brown that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential collaboration or competition. His dark hair is often unkempt, and his angular features give him a slightly rugged appearance. He has a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident involving a faulty mechanical contraption.

**Interests:** Boleslaw's interests are centered around engineering, physics, and innovation. As a child, he was fascinated by the way things worked, often disassembling machines to understand their inner mechanics. His research focus is on sustainable energy solutions, particularly those that can harness and store energy from environmental sources. He is equally passionate about prosthetic limb design and developing new technologies for improving human life.

**Additional Details:** Boleslaw's love of tinkering with machinery began at a young age, watching his father work in the garage laboratory. As he grew older, this interest only deepened, leading him to pursue a degree in engineering from Krakow University. He is well-versed in multiple programming languages, including Python and C++, as well as familiar with various design software used in engineering and physics.

**Quirks:** Boleslaw has a habit of muttering to himself when working on complex problems or experimenting with new ideas. His eyes often light up with excitement when he makes a breakthrough, and he is known to celebrate with a solitary glass of whiskey in his laboratory. Despite the attention that came with his groundbreaking discovery, Boleslaw remains humble, preferring the company of machines and data to the limelight of fame.
