Here is a summary of the fictional character Boleslaw Stensson:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, almost an intensity that seems to see right through you
- Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, slicked back and neatly trimmed to keep out of his face while working at the library
- Build and Physique: Lean, athletic build, allowing him to move silently and with ease, a testament to his years of practice in martial arts.

Personality:
Bolesław Stensson is a man shrouded in mystery. He is quiet and reserved, with an aura of calmness about him that belies the intensity and focus that drive him when on a mission. Those who know him as a librarian are often unaware of the depth of his passion for his craft; he has a deep respect for knowledge and a love for being surrounded by books.

However, when he dons his disguise, Bolesław becomes a different man altogether – one driven by excitement, thrill-seeking adventure, and an insatiable need to uncover hidden truths. This transformation from the quiet, unassuming librarian to the master thief is not just about costume changes but a deep shift in personality that brings him joy and fulfillment.

Interests:
Bolesław Stensson has a deep love for books, particularly ancient texts with stories of mythical artifacts like the gemstone he stole. When he's not working or planning his next heist, Bolesław enjoys reading about history, philosophy, and cultural secrets, often uncovering clues to hidden treasures by exploring lesser-known corners of literature.

His other interest lies in martial arts, which helps him stay agile and prepared for any situation during a heist. He has spent years honing these skills, using his agility and stealth abilities not just as a thieving tactic but also to keep himself safe from those who might be searching for him.

Despite the glamour of being a thief, Bolesław's interests lie more in unraveling mysteries than in accumulating wealth or power; he sees each artifact he steals as an opportunity to learn something new about the world and its secrets.
