Based on the inspiration from Francesco "Totti" Totti, I have created a fictional character profile for Roman Totti:

**Name:** Roman Totti

**Date of Birth:** January 12, 1982

**Height:** 5'11" (180 cm)

**Eye Color:** Dark Brown

**Personality:** Roman Totti is a charismatic and humble individual. He exudes a sense of calm confidence on and off the pitch, which has earned him the respect of his teammates, opponents, and fans alike. His kind heart and infectious smile make him a beloved figure in the football community.

**Interests:**

* **Football**: Roman Totti is an avid player and fan of the sport. He still participates in friendly matches with friends and colleagues, and is always eager to share his expertise and passion for the game.
* **Food**: As a proud Italian, Roman has a deep love for traditional cuisine. His favorite dishes include pasta carbonara, pizza margherita, and osso buco.
* **Travel**: When not playing football or attending club events, Roman enjoys exploring new destinations with his loved ones. He has a particular fondness for visiting the picturesque towns of Italy's countryside.

**Physical Attributes:** Roman Totti shares many physical attributes with his real-life counterpart, Francesco "Totti" Totti. However, I have added some distinct differences to make him a unique character:

* **Facial Structure**: Roman has a slightly more angular face than Francesco, with prominent cheekbones and a strong jawline.
* **Hair**: Roman sports a stylishly messy brown mane that falls across his forehead.
* **Build**: Roman is leaner and more athletic than Francesco, reflecting his intense focus on fitness and well-being.

Overall, Roman Totti embodies the same values of passion, dedication, and humility that have made Francesco "Totti" Totti a legendary figure in Italian football.
