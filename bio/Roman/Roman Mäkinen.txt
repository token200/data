Here's a summary of the fictional character Roman Mäkinen:

**Physical Attributes:**
Roman is a tall and lean individual, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm). His eye color is piercing blue, a trait that seems to gleam with intensity behind his striking features. His hair is dark brown, often worn slickly back to reveal the sharp lines of his face.

**Personality:**
Roman's enigmatic nature makes him difficult to read. He exudes an air of calm confidence, which serves him well in his line of work. Despite his reputation as a master thief, Roman seems almost detached from his actions, as if he is simply a conduit for the art and treasures that bring joy to others. His motivations are often unclear, leaving those around him (including himself) to ponder their true purpose.

**Interests:**
Roman's passion lies in the world of rare artifacts and antiques. He has an innate understanding of the art world and its inner workings, which allows him to navigate the complex web of collectors and dealers with ease. Roman is driven by a desire to bring these treasures into the hands of those who truly appreciate them – a sense of justice that guides his actions.

Outside of his work as a thief, little is known about Roman's interests or personal life. He seems to have few attachments, preferring to maintain a detached exterior that protects him from emotional entanglements. His relationship with Natalia, however, suggests a deep-seated connection that goes beyond mere partnership.

Overall, Roman Mäkinen is a complex and intriguing figure – equal parts enigma, thief, and connoisseur of the rare and beautiful.
