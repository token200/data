Here's a summary of Roman Sepp's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:**
Roman Sepp is a tall man, but his height is not specified in the story. However, considering his profession as a freelance journalist and his experience in war-torn cities and refugee camps, it's likely that he's physically fit and has a rugged appearance.

His eye color is not mentioned in the story, but given his background and occupation, it's possible that he has eyes that have seen too much - perhaps a piercing blue or grey to reflect his intensity and experience.

**Personality:**
Roman Sepp exudes an air of quiet intensity, commanding attention without demanding it. He's a man shrouded in mystery, with a mix of confidence and caution that suggests he's always on the lookout for potential dangers. This is likely due to his past experiences, which have left him with emotional scars and a deep-seated desire to uncover the truth.

Despite this intensity, Roman seems to have a dry sense of humor and a willingness to take risks, as evidenced by his decision to take on new identities in distant lands. He's also fiercely independent and self-reliant, having honed his craft as a journalist through years of experience in some of the world's most challenging environments.

**Interests:**
Roman Sepp is passionate about uncovering the truth, particularly when it comes to exposing corruption and deceit. His interests are likely centered around investigative journalism, politics, and social justice.

He's also driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire for answers, which leads him to take on new projects and stories that push him out of his comfort zone. This is evident in his interest in the refugee crisis, as well as his willingness to investigate further when he uncovers something suspicious.

In terms of personal interests, Roman's background and experiences suggest that he may have a fondness for solitude, perhaps due to the emotional toll of his past encounters. However, his relationship with Lena hints at a capacity for human connection and empathy, which could be an important aspect of his personality.
