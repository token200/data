He is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and navigate treacherous situations with ease. Despite his rough exterior, Roman has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

In his free time, Roman enjoys exploring the city's ancient medina, sampling local cuisine, and listening to traditional Berber music. His passion for justice and his desire to uncover the truth about his brother's death drive him to take risks and push boundaries in pursuit of his goals.

**Other Details:** Roman is a man of few words, preferring to listen more than he talks. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him.
