Here is a summary of the fictional character Roman Fliesbach:

**Physical Attributes:** Roman Fliesbach stands at around 6'2" with an imposing presence. His piercing gaze, described as capable of freezing blood in one's veins, suggests striking eye color. However, no specific eye color is mentioned in the story. He has a rugged, weathered complexion that speaks to his years spent living off the grid on a remote island.

**Personality:** Roman Fliesbach is a man of few words, which implies that he may be introverted or stoic. His nickname "The Ghost" suggests that he is skilled at blending into the shadows and remains unnoticed by those around him. This ability to remain unseen also hints at his ability to observe and listen without drawing attention to himself.

Despite his calm demeanor, Roman Fliesbach has a deep-seated need for justice and will not hesitate to use violence to protect those he cares about. His sister, Luna, is particularly close to him, and his willingness to put himself in harm's way to keep her safe indicates that their bond is strong.

**Interests:** As a former hitman turned recluse, Roman Fliesbach's primary interest seems to be protecting his sister Luna from those who would seek to harm her. He is also skilled at tracking down leads and infiltrating high-stakes underworld organizations, suggesting that he has a strong analytical mind and enjoys solving complex problems.

In addition to his practical interests, Roman appears to have a connection to nature, living on a remote island and taking walks through the jungle. This suggests that he values solitude and may have an appreciation for the beauty of the natural world.

It's also possible that Roman Fliesbach has a strong sense of justice and is driven by a desire to right past wrongs or protect those who have been wronged, such as his sister Luna.
