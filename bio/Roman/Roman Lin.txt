**Personality:** Roman Lin is a complex and calculating individual with a strong sense of determination and self-preservation. He is fiercely intelligent and strategic, always thinking several steps ahead of his opponents.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green

* Build: Lean and athletic, with a commanding presence that is hard to ignore

**Interests:** Roman Lin's interests are closely tied to his business empire and his quest for power. He is intensely focused on building and maintaining his company, Lin Industries, which he sees as the key to securing his legacy. Outside of work, it appears he doesn't have much interest in leisure activities or hobbies that could potentially reveal more about him.

However, some hints at his interests can be inferred:

* Roman has a strong affinity for luxury items and rare collectibles (implied by the high-end sedan and office).
* He enjoys playing with fire, as evidenced by his willingness to take risks and defy convention in business deals.
* The mysterious past and personal costs mentioned earlier suggest that Roman has a fascination with secrecy, power struggles, and manipulating the system.
