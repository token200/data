Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Roman Michalska:

**Personality:** Roman is a deeply emotional and passionate individual, often struggling to find his place in the world. His experiences on the streets of Warsaw as a young boy have shaped him into a resilient and resourceful person, but also left scars that still affect him today. Despite this, he has a strong sense of creativity and a desire to connect with others through music. Roman is fiercely independent and can come across as introverted or aloof to those who don't know him, but beneath his reserved exterior lies a complex web of emotions and desires.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown, almost black
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Slender and wiry, with a lean physique developed from years of playing piano in small spaces.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Music is Roman's primary passion and driving force. He is an accomplished pianist with a deep love for classical music, but also has a strong appreciation for folk and blues traditions. Roman is also deeply interested in poetry and the written word, often finding solace in Katarzyna's words when he feels lost or disconnected from the world around him.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Roman has a quiet fascination with philosophy and the human condition, which often informs his music and performance choices. He is also drawn to the works of existentialist philosophers like Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas resonate deeply with his own experiences of alienation and disconnection.

Despite his many interests, Roman's true love remains music â€“ specifically, playing the piano as a means of self-expression and connection. His relationship with Katarzyna brought out new dimensions to his art, but even now that they are apart, music remains his constant companion, reminding him of what he has lost and what he will always carry with him.
