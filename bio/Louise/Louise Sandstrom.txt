Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Louise Sandstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Louise Sandstrom is described as having a sharp wit and quick tongue, which suggests that she is confident, intelligent, and not afraid to speak her mind. She is also determined, tenacious, and fiercely independent, qualities that serve her well in her career as a journalist. Despite being focused on her investigation, she shows empathy for others when necessary (e.g., noticing the suspicious behavior of the politician's wife). Her determination and courage are admirable traits that earn her respect from her colleagues.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only a few details about Louise's physical appearance are provided in the story. However, based on the narrative style and tone, I will attempt to fill in some gaps:

* **Height:** 5'8" (173 cm) - This height seems plausible for a journalist who is described as being "tall enough" but not imposing.
* **Eye Color:** Green or hazel eyes - Given the author's vivid descriptions of Louise's personality and her no-nonsense attitude, I imagine she would have striking, piercing eyes that convey confidence and intelligence.

**Interests:**

* Investigative journalism - This is no surprise, given Louise's career as a journalist.
* Researching and fact-finding - As described in the story, Louise is meticulous in her research, pouring over documents and conducting interviews to uncover the truth.
* Writing and storytelling - The author highlights Louise's ability to "cut through the noise" and tell compelling stories. This suggests that she values clear writing, concise language, and a narrative that engages readers.

Additional interests might include:

* Politics and current events: As a journalist covering local politics, it's likely that Louise stays informed about national and international news.
* Interviewing people - Louise seems to be able to connect with her sources and elicit candid responses from them.
* Empowerment and justice - Her determination to expose corruption and bring accountability suggests that she values fairness and equal treatment.

Keep in mind that these attributes are inferred based on the limited information provided, but I hope this summary provides a comprehensive (if not entirely fleshed-out) profile of Louise Sandstrom.
