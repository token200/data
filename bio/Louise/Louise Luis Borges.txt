Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges, I've created a fictional character profile for Louise Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep amber with golden flecks, reminiscent of the warm light of an Argentine sunset
* Hair: Dark brown, tied back in a loose bun, with hints of reddish-brown undertones that reflect her Latin American heritage
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a subtle sheen that suggests a mix of Spanish and Italian ancestry
* Build: Petite, yet athletic, with a wiry strength that belies her introspective nature

**Personality:**

* Intellectual curiosity drives Louise Luis Borges to explore the world around her, often getting lost in thought as she ponders the mysteries of life and philosophy.
* Her writing is a reflection of her introspective personality, as she seeks to capture the essence of human experience through magical realism and philosophical musings.
* She has a dry sense of humor and can be quick-witted when provoked, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep empathy for others and a desire to connect with the world around her.
* Louise Luis Borges is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms in favor of exploring new ideas and perspectives.

**Interests:**

* Writing (she's currently working on a novel that blends magical realism with philosophical musings)
* Reading (especially 20th-century Latin American literature, philosophy, and mythology)
* Philosophy (particularly existentialism and phenomenology)
* Travel (she loves exploring new cities and experiencing different cultures)
* Music (her favorite genre is tango, which reflects her Argentine heritage)

**Habits:**

* Louise Luis Borges often keeps a journal to record her thoughts, observations, and writing ideas.
* She has a habit of getting lost in thought, often staring out the window or daydreaming about fictional worlds.
* When she's working on a writing project, she becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand, often forgetting to eat or sleep.

**Goals:**

* To publish her first novel and make a name for herself as a writer
* To explore the intersection of philosophy and literature, using her writing as a tool for self-discovery and social commentary
* To build a community of like-minded writers and thinkers who share her passion for magical realism and philosophical inquiry
