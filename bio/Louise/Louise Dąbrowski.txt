**Personality:** Louise is an introverted and imaginative individual with a passion for storytelling. She has a unique perspective on life, often finding solace in the words of others and weaving their stories into her own imagination. Her name was initially met with mispronunciation, but she has grown accustomed to being different and sees it as a testament to her individuality. Despite her introverted nature, Louise is driven by a sense of purpose and conviction, which stems from her desire to honor the memories of those who came before her.

**Physical Attributes:** Louise stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) with striking blue-green eyes that seem to sparkle when she talks about her latest literary obsession. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in a messy bun, and she has a slender build. She has a small nose ring and a collection of tattoos on her arms, each one representing a different book or author.

**Interests:** Louise's primary interests lie in literature, history, and the preservation of personal stories. She spends most of her days researching, collecting tales of courage and resilience from those who lived through World War II, and sharing these stories with the world. Her apartment is a sanctuary for forgotten histories, filled with stacks of dusty books, scribbled notes, and treasured possessions.

Additionally, Louise has a deep appreciation for Polish culture and history, which she draws inspiration from when creating her own writing projects. She is an avid reader, often devouring books on historical fiction, memoirs, and biographies of resistance fighters during World War II.

Her interest in preserving the stories of others extends beyond literature to other aspects of life. Louise is also a talented photographer, using her camera to capture the beauty of old photographs and letters she finds while researching. She sees these visual stories as an extension of the written word, weaving together the threads of history into a tapestry of memories that will endure long after she's gone.
