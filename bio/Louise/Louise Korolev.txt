Here's a summary of Louise Korolev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Louise is a free-spirited and creative individual who has always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her as a member of Russia's elite social circle. She is determined, passionate, and fiercely independent, with a strong desire to break free from the constraints of her privileged upbringing. As she explores her artistic side, Louise discovers a sense of purpose and self-expression that brings her joy and fulfillment.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes, reminiscent of the subject in the ancient portrait that inspired her
* Hair: Long, dark hair that often falls in loose waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-smooth skin with a subtle golden glow from spending time outdoors
* Build: Slim and athletic, with toned arms from painting and holding brushes

**Interests:** Louise is deeply passionate about art, specifically painting. She spends hours honing her skills, experimenting with different techniques and styles, and exploring the world of color and emotion on canvas. Her interests also extend to reading, particularly Russian literature, and learning about history and culture. As she becomes more confident in her artistic abilities, Louise begins to explore other creative outlets, such as music and photography.

It's worth noting that while Louise is often described as a "princess" in the context of her privileged upbringing, this title is not necessarily one she wears with pride. Instead, it represents a mask or persona that she has shed to reveal her true self as an artist and individual.
