Based on the story, I've created a character profile for Bekzat Krūmiņa:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Bekzat stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender yet wiry build, reflecting his years of collecting and curating the unusual.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an piercing shade of blue, reminiscent of the Baltic Sea that borders Latvia. The intensity of his gaze is matched only by the depth of knowledge he possesses about the world of krūmiņa.

**Personality:**

Bekzat exudes an air of quiet confidence and wisdom. He has a gentle demeanor, which belies the sharpness of his intellect and his dedication to preserving the ancient art form of krūmiņa. As a collector and connoisseur, Bekzat is meticulous in his approach, always seeking out rare and unique specimens to add to his collection.

Despite his reserved nature, Bekzat has a deep passion for connecting people with the beauty of imperfection and human connection. He finds joy in introducing others to the world of krūmiņa and sharing his knowledge with those who are willing to listen. His patience and empathy make him an excellent mentor, as evident in his relationship with Ana.

**Interests:**

Bekzat's interests revolve around collecting, preserving, and sharing the art of krūmiņa. He is deeply fascinated by the historical context and cultural significance of this ancient technique. In addition to curating his collection, Bekzat enjoys:

* Researching and documenting the history of krūmiņa
* Studying the work of other artists who have contributed to the evolution of krūmiņa
* Exploring the intersection of art, nature, and human connection
* Sharing his knowledge with like-minded individuals, such as Ana

**Additional Details:**

Bekzat's love for the unusual and the obscure is reflected in his eclectic wardrobe, which often features tweed jackets, velvet suits, and handcrafted accessories. His shop, Krūmiņa's Curiosities, serves as a reflection of his inner world – a labyrinthine space filled with hidden treasures waiting to be discovered.

Bekzat's age is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on his demeanor and life experience, it can be estimated that he is in his late 60s or early 70s. Despite this, Bekzat remains sharp-minded, agile, and passionate about his craft, making him a compelling mentor to Ana and others who seek to learn from him.
