Based on the short story, here is a summary of Bekzat Petersons' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Bekzat is a driven and ambitious individual with a strong sense of determination and perseverance. He is confident in his ability to ask tough questions and tell compelling stories, which has earned him respect and admiration from his colleagues. Despite the risks involved in pursuing a high-profile corruption scandal, Bekzat remains undaunted and committed to exposing the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Bekzat is of average build, standing at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) tall with dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead. His eyes are a bright blue, which seems almost piercing when focused on someone he's questioning. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** Bekzat is passionate about storytelling and investigation, with a particular interest in exposing corruption and injustice in Kazakhstan. He enjoys conducting interviews, gathering evidence, and piecing together puzzles to reveal the truth. In his free time, he may enjoy reading about history, politics, or economics to better understand the complexities of the world around him. Bekzat is also an avid fan of traditional Kazakh music and cuisine, often seeking out local flavors when researching stories in the city's markets.

It's worth noting that these physical attributes and interests are entirely fictional and not explicitly mentioned in the original short story, but I've inferred them based on the character's personality and actions.
