Here's a summary of Maciej Simon's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Maciej is a complex and introverted individual with a brooding demeanor. He has a dry sense of humor and an obsession with dark humor, which might seem ironic given his love for 19th-century Polish literature. Despite this, he is a deeply emotional and sensitive person who struggles to open up to others due to past experiences of abandonment and loss. However, once he finds someone like Katarzyna, he begins to reveal vulnerabilities and insecurities that had been hidden beneath the surface.

**Physical Attributes:** Maciej has an unassuming appearance that belies his creative and introspective nature. He stands at about 5'9" (175 cm) with an average build. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to hold a world of emotions, while his dark hair is often unkempt and tousled.

**Interests:** Maciej's passions lie in the realm of literature, particularly 19th-century Polish literature which speaks to him on a deep level. He is also an avid reader of philosophy and psychology, drawn to understanding the human condition and the complexities of the human mind. In addition to writing, he enjoys collecting rare books and sipping tea at precisely 7 am each morning, as his inner routine dictates.

Beyond these interests, Maciej's love for order and control is reflected in his meticulous planning and attention to detail. His flat is a reflection of this desire for stability, with everything carefully arranged and organized. However, it's also this need for structure that keeps him from fully embracing life outside of his own head, until he meets Katarzyna.

**Additional Details:** Maciej's love for words and language is deeply ingrained in his being, and he has a unique talent for weaving tales that transport others to another time and place. His writing is often infused with dark humor and wit, but also carries a depth of emotion that resonates with those who read it.
