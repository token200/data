Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Maciej Zarins:

**Name:** Maciej Zarins

**Age:** Late 30s/Early 40s (exact age not specified)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - slightly above average height, giving him an authoritative presence
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, hinting at a sharp and intelligent mind
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and professionally
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique that suggests he's always ready for action

**Personality:** Maciej Zarins is a driven and determined individual, fiercely dedicated to justice and the pursuit of truth. He possesses an unwavering conviction in his mission, often inspiring loyalty and trust from those around him. His years of experience have honed his instincts, making him an exceptional detective with a keen sense of intuition. Maciej is also intensely curious, with a passion for uncovering hidden truths and exposing deception.

**Interests:** Outside of his work as a detective, Maciej appears to be an avid reader, often seeking out books on history, politics, and philosophy. He's also known to enjoy long walks in the park or other quiet activities that allow him to clear his mind and recharge for the next case. Little is known about his personal life or social life beyond work, but it's rumored he values close relationships with those he trusts.

**Additional Details:** Given the similarities between Maciej Jarzynski and Maciej Zarins (same profession, dedication to justice), I've added some distinctive differences to make them distinct characters while maintaining their core traits.
