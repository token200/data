**Personality:** Maciej is a creative and introspective person who wears his heart on his sleeve. Despite his unconventional methods and dedication to his craft, he is not one to seek attention or praise. He is a deeply emotional and empathetic individual, often lost in thought as he navigates the complexities of life. His grief over the loss of his wife Anna has left an indelible mark on him, but it has also ignited a newfound passion for beauty and a desire to find solace in art.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Warm hazelnut brown
* Facial Hair: Short beard that adds to his rugged, yet refined appearance
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders from years of manual labor
* Hair: Dark brown, often tousled from a day's work in the workshop

**Interests:** Maciej is passionate about woodworking, music, and art. He finds solace in the creative process and is constantly seeking new ways to express himself through his craft. Music, in particular, holds a special place in his heart, as it reminds him of his time with Anna. He enjoys playing the violin and listening to classical music, which helps him relax and clear his mind.

In addition to these interests, Maciej has a deep appreciation for history, architecture, and the cultural heritage of Krakow. His love for the city is evident in his workshop, which is filled with vintage tools and artifacts that reflect his fascination with the past.

The magical music box serves as a symbol of hope and renewal for Maciej, reminding him that beauty can be reborn from darkness and that love can transcend even the most profound grief.
