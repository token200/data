Based on the short story, here's a summary of Maciej GÃ³rski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Maciej is a curious and driven individual with a passion for history. He has a strong sense of determination and perseverance, which allows him to spend countless hours researching and investigating his findings. Despite his focus on historical research, Maciej appears to be laid-back and able to laugh at himself, as evident in the story where he jokes about having a PhD in "getting lost in the archives." This self-deprecation suggests that Maciej has a good sense of humor and is not too hard on himself when things don't go according to plan.

Physical Attributes:
Maciej's physical appearance is not explicitly described in the story, but based on his profession as a historian and his habit of getting lost in dusty tomes, it can be inferred that he is likely an intelligent and book-smart individual. His height is not specified, but given the average height of Poles (around 172 cm for men), let's assume Maciej is around 175-180 cm tall.

Eye Color:
Maciej's eye color is not mentioned in the story, so I'll introduce it: He has piercing blue eyes that sparkle with curiosity whenever he's researching or exploring a new topic.

Interests:
As a historian, Maciej's primary interest lies in uncovering hidden secrets and shedding light on forgotten events. He is fascinated by the stories of historical figures and their lives, particularly those connected to his own family history. This drive to learn about the past leads him to investigate obscure manuscripts, interview local historians, and scour archives.

Additional Interests:
It's possible that Maciej has other interests outside of history, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the story. Given his personality and profession, it's likely that he enjoys reading, writing, or even practicing his Polish language skills to connect with his cultural heritage.
