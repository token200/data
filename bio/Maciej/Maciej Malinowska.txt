Here's a summary of Maciej Malinowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Maciej is a complex and brooding individual with a troubled past. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to solve cases that others deem unsolvable. His experiences in the military have left emotional scars, and he struggles to form close relationships due to his trust issues. However, when confronted with a case, Maciej becomes intensely focused and determined to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn short
* Build: Lean and athletic from his military days
* Facial Features: Chiseled, rugged, and weathered from years of exposure to the elements

**Interests:** Maciej's interests are largely driven by his profession as a detective. He is fascinated by human psychology and behavior, which helps him understand the motivations behind crimes. Outside of work, he has little time for leisure activities, but when he does, he enjoys:

* Reading: Historical non-fiction and classic literature
* Hiking: Exploring the Polish countryside and wilderness areas near Warsaw
* Music: Traditional folk music from Poland, with a particular fondness for Chopin's nocturnes

Maciej's interests are mostly solo pursuits, reflecting his introverted nature. However, as he navigates complex cases, he may find himself drawn to working with others, particularly those who share his passion for justice.

The missing details I made up include:
