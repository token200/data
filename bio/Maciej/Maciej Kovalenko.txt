Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Maciej Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Maciej stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often worn in a messy style, framing his sharp features. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a hint of sadness. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, which he obtained during one of his street-smart escapades.

**Personality:**
Maciej is a complex and introspective person with a dry sense of humor. On the surface, he appears to be rugged and unforgiving, having spent years living on the streets and relying solely on himself for survival. However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep well of vulnerability and emotional depth. He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, which has made him wary of getting close to people in the past.

Despite his toughened demeanor, Maciej is a romantic at heart, yearning for meaningful connections with others. He is deeply compassionate and empathetic, able to connect with those who are struggling, like Sophia. His introspective nature allows him to reflect on his experiences and analyze them from multiple angles.

**Interests:**
Maciej has a deep passion for restoring and repairing old vehicles, particularly vintage cars. This hobby not only provides an outlet for his creative energy but also serves as a nostalgic reminder of the past. He finds solace in the intricate details and mechanics involved in reviving classic machines, which allow him to channel his emotions into something productive.

In addition to his love for car restoration, Maciej is an avid observer of human nature, often studying people's behavior and interactions from a detached perspective. This curiosity about others' lives and experiences allows him to empathize with their struggles and connect on a deeper level.

Maciej also enjoys the simple pleasures in life: watching sunsets, reading classic literature, and stargazing on quiet nights. These activities provide an escape from his turbulent past and offer moments of respite from the turmoil that lies beneath his surface.
