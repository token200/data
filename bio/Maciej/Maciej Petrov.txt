Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Maciej Petrov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Maciej Petrov appears to be a determined and driven individual. He is fiercely devoted to finding his missing wife Elena and is willing to risk everything to uncover the truth. His past experience as a Soviet spy suggests that he has developed strong instincts and is skilled in navigating complex situations. Despite this, his personal life is marked by sadness and loss (his late wife), which could indicate that he may struggle with emotional vulnerability.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a way that makes him appear slightly unkempt.
* Build: Lean and athletic, likely honed from his years as a Soviet spy.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Maciej appears to have a deep interest in uncovering the truth and bringing justice to those who have been wronged. As a former spy, he is likely highly skilled in surveillance, infiltration, and analysis of evidence. His personal experience with his wife's disappearance drives his investigation, but it also suggests that he has a strong sense of justice and will stop at nothing to see that it is served.

It is worth noting that Maciej seems to be a man of few words, preferring to observe and listen rather than dominate conversations. This could indicate a more introspective or analytical personality type.
