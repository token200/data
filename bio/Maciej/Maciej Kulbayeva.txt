Based on the story provided, I have created a profile for Maciej Kulbayeva:

**Physical Attributes:**
Maciej Kulbayeva is a tall and lean figure, standing at approximately 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) in height. His striking features include piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, a strong jawline, and a distinctive nose with a subtle bump. His dark brown hair is often neatly trimmed, revealing a sharp, angular face that commands attention.

**Personality:**
Maciej Kulbayeva is an enigmatic and driven individual, driven by an unwavering commitment to justice and truth. He is intensely analytical and detail-oriented, with a natural ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues. His quiet confidence and calm demeanor can be unnerving, as if he is always observing his surroundings without being noticed. Despite this, Maciej has a deep sense of empathy for those affected by crime, which fuels his tireless pursuit of justice.

**Interests:**
Outside of his work as a detective, Maciej Kulbayeva enjoys reading classic literature and classical music. He is particularly fond of the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Chopin, finding solace in their dark, introspective melodies. When not solving crimes or analyzing evidence, Maciej can be found strolling through the city's parks, lost in thought, or sipping coffee at a local caf√©, pondering the intricacies of human nature.
