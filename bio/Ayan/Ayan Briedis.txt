Based on the short story provided, I've created a character profile for Ayan Briedis:

**Name:** Ayan Briedis
**Age:** 25
**Occupation:** Artist and freelance designer
**Location:** Riga, Latvia
**Height:** 5'8" (173 cm)
**Eye Color:** Hazel with golden flecks

Ayan is a creative and curious individual who is passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and art. She has a natural talent for design and coding, which she uses to bring her ideas to life. Her hazel eyes sparkle with creativity, and her long, dark hair often falls in loose waves down her back.

**Personality:** Ayan is an introverted and slightly reserved person who feels more comfortable expressing herself through her art than in social situations. She is fiercely independent and values her alone time, but has a deep sense of empathy for others. As she delves deeper into the virtual world, she becomes increasingly introspective and self-aware, questioning her own motivations and desires.

**Interests:** Ayan's interests lie at the intersection of art, technology, and science fiction. She enjoys exploring new ideas and concepts, particularly those related to virtual reality and augmented reality. She is also fascinated by coding languages and loves experimenting with different design tools and software. In her free time, she enjoys reading science fiction novels and watching documentaries on space exploration.

**Background:** Ayan's grandfather was a veteran of the Soviet space program, which sparked her interest in technology and space exploration from a young age. She inherited his old virtual reality headset as a memento and has since become obsessed with exploring the possibilities of VR and AR art. Her family is concerned about her increasing reclusiveness, but Ayan feels drawn to the virtual world as a way to express herself and tap into her creativity.
