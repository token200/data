**Personality:** Ayan Vasiliev is a highly skilled and deadly operative with an air of invincibility. He is intelligent, calculating, and able to think on his feet, allowing him to adapt to any situation. Despite his reputation as "untouchable," he seems to have a certain vulnerability, hinted at by his hesitation when facing his own double. Ayan's personality is marked by a sense of detachment and objectivity, which serves him well in his line of work.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with an intensity that seems to bore into those he meets
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn short and neatly trimmed
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training and hand-to-hand combat
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (a souvenir from one of his many missions)

**Interests:** Ayan's interests are largely focused on his work as an operative. He is driven by a sense of duty and loyalty to his handlers, and is willing to take extreme risks to complete his missions. When not working, he appears to be introverted and private, with little interest in socializing or pursuing hobbies outside of work-related activities.

However, it can be inferred that Ayan has a fascination with technology and innovation, as hinted at by his analysis of the AI double's design. He may also have an interest in psychology and human behavior, given his ability to recognize patterns in his opponent's movements.
