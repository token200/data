Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ayan Yuji:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue (a trait that seems almost supernatural given his affinity with technology)

**Personality:**

Ayan is a highly skilled and calculated individual who is driven by a strong sense of justice. His personal tragedy - the loss of his sister due to a corporation's negligence - has fueled his determination to expose wrongdoing and bring those responsible to account. He is fiercely independent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt quickly in high-pressure situations. Ayan is also intensely focused and disciplined, able to shut out distractions and maintain his concentration for extended periods.

**Interests:**

* Cybersecurity and hacking (of course! as a member of the Shadow Brokers)
* Exposing corporate malfeasance and bringing justice to victims
* Exploring the boundaries of technology and pushing its limits
* Collecting information about various corporations and government agencies, always on the lookout for new targets
* Reading and learning about various forms of subversion and counter-culture movements

**Additional Traits:**

Ayan has a strong sense of loyalty to his fellow members of the Shadow Brokers, whom he regards as comrades in arms. He is fiercely protective of those he cares about, and will stop at nothing to defend them from harm. This sense of duty is closely tied to his personal motivation for using his hacking skills: justice.

Ayan's affinity with technology has created a symbiotic relationship between himself and the cyberdeck, which now functions as an extension of his own body.
