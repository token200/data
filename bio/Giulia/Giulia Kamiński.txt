Here's a summary of Giulia Kamiński's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Giulia is 165 cm (5'5") tall with long, dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with curiosity when she talks about astronomy. She has a small tattoo of the constellation Cassiopeia on her left shoulder blade, a memento from her grandmother's old telescope.

**Personality:**
Giulia is a introspective and analytical person, often lost in thought as she ponders complex scientific concepts. Despite her intellectual nature, she has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, which makes her come across as witty and down-to-earth. As she navigates this new chapter in her life, Giulia is learning to balance her independence with vulnerability and openness to new experiences.

**Interests:**
Giulia's passion for astronomy is only matched by her love of discovery and exploration. She is driven by a curiosity about the universe and its many mysteries. In addition to her work on black holes and dark matter, Giulia enjoys:

* Reading scientific papers and books on theoretical physics
* Stargazing and attending astronomy club meetings
* Visiting museums and historical sites related to science and technology
* Trying out new recipes in her grandmother's old kitchen
* Learning languages (currently working on Polish)
* Hiking and exploring the outdoors, finding solace in nature

As she reconnects with her roots in Kraków, Giulia is rediscovering the joy of exploration and discovery that once defined her academic career. With Łukasz by her side, she's excited to embark on this new journey and see where it takes her.
