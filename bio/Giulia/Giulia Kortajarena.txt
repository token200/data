Here's a summary of the fictional character Giulia Kortajarena:

**Physical Attributes:** Giulia stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her striking features include piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets, framed by thick eyelashes and adorned with subtle yet noticeable makeup. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of night, framing her heart-shaped face.

**Personality:** Giulia exudes confidence and calmness under pressure, always staying one step ahead of the game. Her quiet demeanor belies an unyielding ambition and strategic thinking, making her a formidable opponent in both personal and professional settings. She is fiercely intelligent, able to think on her feet and outmaneuver her opponents with ease.

**Interests:** Giulia has a keen interest in high-stakes poker games, as evident from the Monte Carlo game described in the short story. Her passion for the game extends beyond just winning; she seems to be drawn to the thrill of competition and the art of manipulation that comes with it. Additionally, her mysterious past suggests a fondness for secrets, whispers, and intrigue.

While no further details about Giulia's interests outside of poker are provided in the short story, we can infer from her background as "a woman shrouded in mystery" that she might have an appreciation for:

1. High-society events: As someone who navigates the elite world with ease, Giulia may enjoy attending exclusive gatherings and high-stakes social events.
2. Espionage and intelligence gathering: Her claims of being a former spy or master thief hint at an interest in espionage, surveillance, and strategy, making her well-versed in covert operations and counter-surveillance techniques.

Giulia's enigmatic nature makes it challenging to pinpoint specific interests beyond the realm of poker. However, it is clear that she is driven by a deep-seated desire for intellectual stimulation, strategic prowess, and the allure of secrets and intrigue.
