**Personality:**
Morel is a complex and introspective individual. He has a deep sense of loss and guilt stemming from his experiences during the war, which can make him come across as aloof or distant to those who don't know him. However, once you gain his trust, he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

Despite his tough exterior, Morel has a vulnerable side that he only reveals to those closest to him. He is haunted by the ghosts of his past, but this also drives him to be more empathetic and understanding towards others who have experienced similar traumas.

**Interests:**
Morel's primary interests lie in fishing and living off the land. He finds solace in the peaceful rhythms of nature, which helps to calm his mind and soothe his emotional scars. He is an avid fisherman, often venturing out onto the open waters early each morning or late into the evening.

In addition to his love for nature, Morel has a strong interest in history and the struggles of Japan's veterans with PTSD. His experiences during the war have left him with a deep understanding of the psychological toll that such trauma can take on individuals.

Morel also enjoys listening to traditional Japanese music, particularly the shamisen, which brings back memories of his childhood.
