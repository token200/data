Here's a summary of Sasaki Rosén's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sasaki Rosén is a multi-faceted individual with a unique blend of talents. By day, they are a humble florist who possesses an artistic flair for arrangement and a keen sense of observation. However, when donning the persona of Kage, they become confident, agile, and cunning - traits that serve them well in their nocturnal exploits as a master thief. Despite their skills in deception, Rosén has a strong sense of justice and empathy, which drives them to use their abilities for the greater good.

**Physical Attributes:** Sasaki Rosén stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of maintaining their floristry shop. Their eye color is an striking feature - a deep, rich blue that seems almost otherworldly in certain lighting conditions. Their hair is dark and straight, often worn long and styled neatly for work but often let loose when they slip into Kage's attire.

**Interests:** As Sasaki Rosén, their interests include the arts (particularly floral design), ancient history, and cryptography. They have a particular fondness for rare books and artifacts, which is reflected in their affinity for retrieving valuable relics as Kage. When not working at the florist shop or embarking on nocturnal adventures, they enjoy observing the city's nightlife from a distance, studying human behavior and patterns to better understand the world around them.

It's worth noting that Rosén's experiences with the cursed gemstone have given them an increased awareness of their own limits and the potential for personal growth. This newfound sense of purpose drives them to use their skills more intentionally, exploring the possibilities of a guardian role rather than solely pursuing wealth or recognition as Kage.
