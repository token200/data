Here is a summary of Sasaki Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus was known for his sharp mind, bravery, and unwavering dedication to the Empire. He possessed a strong sense of honor, loyalty, and duty, which drove him to excel in battle and expand Rome's borders. Despite being destined for greatness due to his patrician birth, he remained humble and grounded, never seeking power or recognition for its own sake.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - a tall and imposing figure, fitting for a Roman general
* Eye Color: Piercing blue - a color that seemed to bore into those he met, reflecting his unwavering intensity and focus

**Interests:** Drusus's interests were largely centered around his duty to Rome and the Empire. He was deeply passionate about military strategy, tactics, and leadership, often spending countless hours studying and refining his skills. He also had a strong interest in diplomacy and statecraft, recognizing the importance of forging alliances with neighboring tribes and securing crucial agreements.

As for personal interests outside of duty, little is known about Drusus's preferences or hobbies. However, it can be inferred that he valued simplicity and humility above all else, rarely seeking to draw attention to himself or flaunt his achievements. His focus on duty and honor likely consumed most of his free time, leaving little room for personal indulgences.

It's worth noting that the story's portrayal of Drusus as a ghostly apparition is more mythological than historical fact, and should not be taken as an accurate representation of his personality or character.
