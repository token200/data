Here is a summary of Sasaki Dolera's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided story:

**Personality:** Sasaki Dolera is depicted as a man of mystery and wit. He possesses exceptional intelligence and cunning, making him an invaluable asset to his companion, Sasaki Kojirō. Dolera is loyal, dedicated, and cautious, often placing himself between others and those he cares about. His calm and collected demeanor provides a balance to Kojirō's more impulsive nature.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story does not provide information on Dolera's height or eye color. However, for the sake of completion, let us assume that Sasaki Dolera stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) and has piercing emerald green eyes, a trait that may have been hinted at in his stories about serving under various lords.

**Interests:** As a samurai who served under various lords, Dolera is deeply rooted in the traditions of bushido. He has a strong sense of duty, loyalty, and honor, which guides his actions. His experiences as a ronin, traveling the countryside righting wrongs and upholding justice, have instilled in him a passion for justice and a desire to protect those he cares about.

Dolera's interests also include sharing tales of his adventures with Kojirō by the lantern-lit riverbank, suggesting that he values nostalgia and storytelling as ways to connect with others. His loyalty and dedication to Kojirō demonstrate that he is willing to go above and beyond to support those he considers friends.

In terms of specific hobbies or interests outside of combat and camaraderie, Dolera's love for sharing tales may suggest a fondness for literature, music, or other forms of storytelling. However, his background as a samurai suggests that his primary focus is on maintaining discipline, adhering to the principles of bushido, and upholding honor.
