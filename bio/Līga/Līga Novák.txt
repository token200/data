Here is a summary of Līga Novák's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Līga is a calculating and ruthless enforcer who values control above all else. She has earned her reputation as a skilled and efficient operator in the Tālava crime family, and is known for being fiercely loyal to those who share her goals. Her sharp mind and quick reflexes make her the go-to person for delicate operations that require finesse. Despite this tough exterior, there are hints of detachment and a deep understanding of human psychology, suggesting that Līga may have a more complex emotional landscape than initially meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Līga is of Slavic descent, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. She stands at 5'8" (172 cm), which allows her to move with ease in tight spaces while maintaining an intimidating presence. Her slender yet athletic build suggests a background in martial arts or similar discipline.

**Interests:** As a member of the Tālava crime family, Līga's interests are likely centered around power, control, and manipulation. She is drawn to complex puzzles and strategic games, suggesting a high level of cognitive ability and a desire for intellectual challenges. In her free time (if such a concept exists in her world), she may enjoy more refined pursuits like reading literature or listening to classical music, which could provide an interesting contrast to her rougher, more brutal work.

In terms of hobbies or interests outside of her crime family affiliation, there is little to be gleaned from the short story. However, given Līga's reputation as a ruthless enforcer, it's possible that she may have few "hobbies" in the classical sense.
