I'll create a fictional character inspired by the real-life Martina Navratilova's friend and fellow athlete. Here's a short summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Līga Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
Līga stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back. Her bright blue eyes sparkle with determination and enthusiasm whenever she's on the court. She has a small tattoo of a tennis racket on her left shoulder blade, which symbolizes her passion for the sport.

**Personality:**
Līga is an outgoing and confident individual who exudes positivity wherever she goes. Her infectious smile can light up a room, and her warm demeanor puts everyone at ease. She's fiercely competitive, both on and off the court, but never loses sight of her values: kindness, humility, and sportsmanship.

**Interests:**
Līga is an avid fan of classical music, often listening to Chopin and Mozart while she trains or relaxes. She's also a talented painter, enjoying the creative outlet that art provides when she needs to unwind after a long match. When not on the court, Līga can be found exploring the beautiful landscapes of Latvia, from rolling hills to serene lakes.

**Additional Details:**
Līga is an avid reader and has a special fondness for novels by her favorite author, J.K. Rowling. She's also a skilled cook, often experimenting with new recipes in her spare time. Despite her busy schedule, Līga makes it a point to volunteer at local tennis clinics and youth programs, where she can share her expertise and inspire the next generation of tennis players.
