Based on the inspiration from the short story about Līga Meinstein, here is a summary of the character's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Līga Meinstein is a brilliant and reclusive scientist with an intense focus on her work. She has a strong passion for innovation and problem-solving, which drives her to push the boundaries of quantum physics and artificial intelligence. Despite her success, she prefers to keep to herself, but has a spark of excitement when discussing her ideas. Līga is fiercely intelligent and analytical, often coming across as mysterious or even guarded to those who don't know her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of green
* Hair: Dark brown, cut in a practical yet elegant style that suits her busy lifestyle

Līga's physical appearance is understated yet refined, reflecting her focus on intellect over material possessions. Her height and striking eye color give her an air of authority, while her dark hair frames her heart-shaped face.

**Interests:** Līga Meinstein is deeply passionate about:

* Quantum physics: She spends most of her time studying the intricacies of quantum mechanics, exploring new theories and approaches.
* Artificial intelligence: Her work on AI focuses on creating intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and evolve like humans.
* Science fiction: Līga has a fascination with science fiction novels and films, often drawing inspiration from their exploration of complex ideas and futuristic worlds.

Līga's interests are deeply intertwined with her work, as she seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical applications. Her passion for innovation drives her to push the boundaries of what is possible in both AI and quantum physics research.

In the spirit of Līga Meinstein's private nature, I have added a few personal details that can be used to further develop this character:

* She has a fondness for antique tea sets and enjoys sipping Earl Grey while working late nights.
* Her laboratory is filled with rare, leather-bound books on physics and mathematics.
* Līga is an avid collector of peculiar scientific instruments, which adorn the shelves in her laboratory.

These details add depth to Līga's character, hinting at a more personal side beneath her reserved exterior.
