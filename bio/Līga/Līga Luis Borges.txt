I must correct you again - I couldn't find any information on a person named Līga Luis Borges. It seems that the short story about Jorge Luis Borges was inspired by him, but there is no record of a fictional character named Līga.

However, assuming you'd like to create a fictional character based on the life and works of Jorge Luis Borges, here's a summary:

**Name:** Līga (a creative variation of the author's name)

**Age:** Late 30s/Early 40s

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green, similar to the young woman in the story
* Hair: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Slim and introspective, with a quiet air of confidence
* Face: Heart-shaped, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin

**Personality:** Līga is an enigmatic and curious individual, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of existence. He has a dry sense of humor and is not afraid to explore the darker corners of human experience. Despite his introverted nature, he has a deep desire to connect with others on a philosophical level.

**Interests:**

* Reading: Līga devours books on philosophy, literature, and mysticism.
* Writing: He spends most of his time scribbling in notebooks, experimenting with new ideas and stories.
* Philosophy: Līga is fascinated by the nature of reality, time, and space. He often finds himself lost in discussions about metaphysics, epistemology, and the limits of human understanding.

**Additional Traits:** Līga has a habit of carrying a worn leather satchel with him wherever he goes, filled with notes, ideas, and fragments of writing. He is often accompanied by a small, pocket-sized notebook that contains his most precious thoughts and musings.

Please note that these attributes are fictional and inspired by the life and works of Jorge Luis Borges.
