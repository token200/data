Here is a summary of Dominik Cara's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dominik is a determined and driven individual who has seen his fair share of darkness in his work as a detective. Despite this, he exudes a sense of calmness and composure, which allows him to remain focused on the task at hand. He is fiercely intelligent and analytical, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues to form a coherent picture of a case. However, his intense focus can also make him appear aloof or distant to those around him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets
* Hair: Dark brown hair, often styled neatly and trimmed closely

**Interests:** Dominik is deeply invested in his work as a detective, particularly when it comes to cases involving young victims or those with similarities to previous unsolved crimes. He is also an avid reader of true crime novels and documentaries, which helps him stay up-to-date on the latest investigative techniques and theories.

Outside of work, Dominik seems to have few personal interests or hobbies, but his strong sense of justice and desire for closure drive him to keep pushing forward in his investigations. His dedication to solving cases has made him a respected figure within the NYPD's Homicide Unit, but it also comes at a personal cost, leaving little room for other aspects of his life.

The mysterious encounter with the woman in black leather jacket has sparked something within Dominik, however - a sense that there may be more to this case than meets the eye. His drive for answers will likely take him down a complex and potentially perilous path, one that challenges everything he thought he knew about the world.
