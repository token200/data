**Physical Attributes:** Dominik Rossi is of average height, around 5'10" (178 cm). His eye color is a deep brown, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if trying to uncover their secrets. He has short, dark hair that's often messy and unkempt, giving him a rugged, disheveled appearance. Rossi's features are sharp, with high cheekbones and a strong jawline, but his eyes betray a tiredness and weariness that comes from dealing with the darker side of human nature.
