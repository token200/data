Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Sándor Bērziņa:

**Name:** Sándor Bērziņa

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s (exact age unknown)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a neat, messy style
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned from spending time outdoors and working on computers for extended periods
* Build: Lean, with a wiry physique developed from years of coding and minimal physical activity

**Personality:** Sándor is a quiet, introspective individual who is highly focused on his work. He has a dry sense of humor, which he only reveals to those closest to him. Despite his reclusive nature, he is a warm and generous person who puts the needs of others before his own. His kind heart and willingness to help others have earned him a reputation as a skilled programmer in the tech community.

**Interests:** As a skilled programmer, Sándor's primary interests lie in developing innovative solutions to complex problems. He is also passionate about learning new things, often devouring books on a wide range of subjects from philosophy to mathematics. In his free time, he enjoys exploring the outdoors and taking long walks through the city center, where he can clear his mind and think creatively.

**Hobbies:** Sándor's favorite hobby is coding, of course! He also enjoys attending tech conferences and meetups, where he can network with other programmers and learn about new developments in the field. In addition to these activities, he is an avid reader and enjoys browsing through used bookstores or online marketplaces.

**Quirks:** Sándor has a few quirks that have become endearing to those who know him. He often fidgets with his keyboard when excited or deep in thought, and has a habit of tapping his pen on the edge of his desk when trying to remember a specific code snippet. Despite his introverted nature, he is also an avid collector of rare programming books and zines.

**Background:** Sándor grew up in Riga, Latvia, where he developed a passion for coding at a young age. He spent most of his days working on projects and learning new skills, eventually becoming one of the top programmers in the tech community. His reclusive nature is partly due to his intense focus on work, but also because he has always been sensitive to noise and distractions.

Overall, Sándor Bērziņa is a complex and fascinating individual with a rich inner life and a passion for coding that drives him forward.
