Based on the short story, here is a summary of Sándor Allende's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sándor Allende is a man in his mid-to-late 40s or early 50s. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender build, suggesting he may have been more athletic before life took its toll. His eye color is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the description of Luna's striking green eyes, it can be inferred that Sándor has a similar or complementary eye color.

**Personality:**
Sándor appears to be introspective and brooding, with a deep sense of loss and regret stemming from his father's passing. However, as he interacts with Luna, we see hints of vulnerability and a willingness to open up. He is likely passionate about social justice and equality, inherited from his father's legacy. Sándor may struggle with finding his place in the world after his father's death, but meeting Luna seems to inspire him to rekindle his sense of purpose.

**Interests:**
Sándor has a strong affinity for literature, as evident from the dog-eared novel on the table beside him. He is also interested in politics and history, particularly the struggles against authoritarian regimes like Pinochet's Chilean regime. Music or poetry are not explicitly mentioned, but Sándor's connection with Luna over shared interests suggests that he may have a creative side.
