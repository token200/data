**Physical Attributes:** Sándor is a tall and lean figure, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). His piercing eyes are a deep shade of indigo, an uncommon color that adds to his mysterious aura. His dark brown hair is always impeccably styled, framing his chiseled features.

Despite his cold exterior, he has a deep sense of loyalty to those he cares about, particularly Sofia. His sharp intellect and analytical mind make him a master strategist.

**Interests:** Sándor's interests are largely centered around his work as a spy and assassin. He is an expert in hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, and infiltration techniques. Outside of his missions, he enjoys sipping coffee at small cafes, observing the city life from afar.
