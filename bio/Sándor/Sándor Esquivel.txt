Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Sándor Esquivel's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Sándor stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his angular features. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to gleam with intensity in the right light. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a troubled past.

**Personality:** Sándor Esquivel is a cunning and resourceful individual, honed by years of navigating the shadows of Cartagena's ancient city walls as a skilled thief. He exudes confidence and control, but beneath this façade lies a complex web of motivations and desires that drive him to take risks. As shown in the story, Sándor has a taste for adventure and is willing to push boundaries, even if it means confronting curses or supernatural forces.

**Interests:** Sándor's primary interest is acquiring valuable treasures and artifacts, often through illicit means. He has a particular fondness for gold coins, velvet pouches, and other trinkets that hold monetary value. On a more intangible level, Sándor seems drawn to the thrill of the hunt, the rush of adrenaline when outsmarting his enemies or escaping danger.

It's worth noting that Sándor's fascination with the cursed vial of amber liquid hints at a deeper curiosity about the unknown and the occult. This could be an area where he is exploring new interests or grappling with moral ambiguities, adding depth to his character.
