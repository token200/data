Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Sándor Szabó:

**Personality:** Sándor Szabó appears to be a introspective and melancholic person, having spent years in exile after being forced to flee his homeland due to his art. He has a strong connection to music, which serves as a sanctuary for him during difficult times. Despite this, he seems to be open to new experiences and connections, as evident when he meets the young woman at the piano.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details about Sándor's physical appearance are provided in the story. However, based on his profession as a violinist, it is likely that he has developed some level of artistic refinement, such as good posture and hand-eye coordination.

Given his profession, it is possible to infer that Sándor may have dark hair and eyes, which were common characteristics among Hungarian musicians during the 20th century. His height is not specified, but it's possible that he is an average or slightly above-average height for a man of his age.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, music is Sándor's primary interest. He is deeply passionate about playing the violin and has spent countless hours practicing and perfecting his craft. His love for Chopin and Debussy suggests that he appreciates classical music and may have a refined taste in art.

Sándor also seems to appreciate Hungarian folk music, as evident when he listens to the young woman's rendition of a traditional song. This appreciation for cultural heritage suggests that he values tradition and authenticity, which is likely due to his own experiences with exile and displacement.

It is worth noting that Sándor's interests may extend beyond music, given his connection to the young woman and their shared experience of rediscovering Budapest together. However, based on the provided story, it is unclear what specific non-musical interests he may have.
