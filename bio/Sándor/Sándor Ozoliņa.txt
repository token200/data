Sándor's personality is complex and multi-layered. On the surface, he appears to be charming and charismatic, able to effortlessly navigate social situations and make connections with people from diverse backgrounds. However, beneath this façade lies a fiercely loyal and protective individual who will stop at nothing to defend those he cares about.

Despite this restless nature, he remains fiercely grounded and focused on his goals, using his travels as an opportunity to broaden his perspective and gain new insights.
