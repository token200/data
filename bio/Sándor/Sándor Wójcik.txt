Here's a summary of Sándor Wójcik's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Sándor stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming build. His eyes are a deep brown color that seem to hold a depth of wisdom beyond his years. He has short, dark hair that is often neatly trimmed.

**Personality:** Sándor is a complex individual with a mix of introversion and curiosity. He walks with a quiet confidence that allows him to blend into the crowd, but at the same time, he possesses an insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding about human experiences. Despite his polished exterior, he feels disconnected from his heritage and struggles to form meaningful connections with others.

**Interests:** Sándor's interests revolve around language, culture, and history. He is a polyglot who has spent years studying languages and navigating different cultures as an interpreter for diplomats and businesspeople. In Budapest, he finds himself drawn to the city's ruin bars and hidden gems, where he can immerse himself in Hungarian history and customs. Magda introduces him to traditional Hungarian stories, recipes, and cultural practices that help him find a sense of belonging.

Despite his love for languages, Sándor is not fluent in Hungarian at first but gradually becomes proficient as he immerses himself in the culture through conversations with Magda.
