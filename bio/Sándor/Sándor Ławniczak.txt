**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often kept short and neatly trimmed
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical training and high-stakes missions.

**Interests:** Sándor has a fascination with the past, particularly Polish history and culture. The music box and Anna's stories about its history sparked a renewed interest in exploring his own heritage and legacy.

His connection to the music box has also rekindled an appreciation for traditional crafts and woodworking.

While Sándor still struggles with feelings of identity and belonging, he has found a sense of purpose through his involvement with the music box and its history. He is slowly rediscovering himself, shedding the layers of his past persona to reveal a more authentic self.
