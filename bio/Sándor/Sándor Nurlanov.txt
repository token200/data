Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Sándor Nurlanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sándor appears to be a introspective and determined individual. He is driven by a desire for answers about his past, which has led him down a path of self-discovery. His instincts tell him to be cautious, but he also seems open to trusting others, as evidenced by his willingness to take Akira's information at face value. When faced with the choice between redemption and self-destruction, Sándor shows resilience and conviction.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly and slightly messy

While the story doesn't provide much information about Sándor's physical appearance beyond his eyes, it's clear that he is a tall and imposing figure. The description of Akira as having piercing green eyes adds contrast to her striking features.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Sándor is interested in:

* Uncovering hidden secrets about his past
* Understanding the truth behind his complicated history
* Learning more about espionage and deception (as hinted at by Akira's mention of "espionage and deceit")
* Exploring a world beyond his known reality (represented by Akira's introduction to him)

It's likely that Sándor is also curious about the mysterious figure who has summoned him, Akira, and her motivations for helping him. The story hints at a deeper connection between them, but its full extent remains unclear.
