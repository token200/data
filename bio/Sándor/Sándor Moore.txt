**Personality:** Sándor "Sand" Moore is an enigmatic figure known for his masterful deception and manipulation. He possesses a charismatic charm that allows him to effortlessly talk his way out of situations, but beneath this façade lies a calculating mind driven by ambition and self-preservation. Sand's ability to think on his feet and adapt to new situations makes him a formidable con artist. Despite his polished exterior, he harbors moments of guilt and self-doubt, particularly when he manipulates others for personal gain.

**Physical Attributes:** Sándor Moore stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, allowing him to move seamlessly through crowded spaces unnoticed. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if seeing right through their facade. His dark hair is often styled neatly, framing his sharp facial features and angular jawline. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a troubled past, adding depth to his otherwise polished appearance.

**Interests:** As a seasoned con artist, Sand has developed an expertise in various areas of art history, antiquities, and rare collectibles. He is fascinated by the world of high-stakes deals and the thrill of outwitting his marks. When not planning his next scheme or pulling off a daring heist, Sand enjoys studying human psychology and behavior, analyzing what makes people vulnerable to deception. His travels have also given him a taste for fine wine, luxury cars, and exclusive experiences – the finer things in life that he often manipulates others to provide for him.
