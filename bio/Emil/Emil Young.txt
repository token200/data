Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Emil Young's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Emil Young is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a vulnerable side. He has been shaped by his difficult childhood and past experiences, which have fueled his anger and pain into becoming one of the city's most feared and respected private investigators. Despite this, he seems to be driven by a strong sense of justice and determination, as evident in his refusal to give up on solving the case of the missing sister.

**Physical Attributes:** Emil is described as standing at an unknown height, but it can be inferred that he is likely around 6'1" or 6'2", given his presence in the crowded French Quarter. His eye color is not explicitly mentioned, but based on his rugged and tough demeanor, it's possible that he has piercing blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** Emil's interests are largely centered around his work as a private investigator, tracking down missing persons and solving cases involving high-stakes poker games and high-society scandals. He seems to be drawn to the darker and more mysterious aspects of New Orleans' underbelly, particularly in relation to spirituality and the supernatural.

It's worth noting that Emil's interests may also include:

* Music: As a fan of jazz and blues, Emil may have an appreciation for the art form and its history.
* History: Given his connection to Chicago's South Side and the gang war that took place there, Emil may be fascinated by the city's history and the events that shaped him.
* Spirituality: His interest in Congo Square and the mystical underbelly of New Orleans suggests that he may have an affinity for spiritual practices or a desire to explore the unknown.

Overall, Emil Young is a multi-faceted character with a complex personality, driven by both a sense of justice and a curiosity about the world around him.
