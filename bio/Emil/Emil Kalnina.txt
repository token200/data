Based on the inspiration provided by the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Emil Kalnina:

**Personality:** Emil Kalnina is an enigmatic figure known for his humility and dedication to his craft. Despite his troubled past, he remains focused and driven, with an insatiable hunger to master every technique and tactic in lithuanian swordsmanship. He is a natural leader, commanding respect from his peers and inspiring confidence in those who follow him. However, his past emotional scars still linger, making him guarded around those he does not trust.

**Physical Attributes:** Emil stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic build honed from years of rigorous training. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and tied back in a ponytail, revealing his piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His eyes are framed by a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, souvenirs from a past battle.

**Interests:** As an expert swordsman, Emil's primary interest lies in the art of lithuanian swordsmanship itself. He is constantly seeking new techniques to master, pushing himself to the limits of human endurance and skill. Outside of combat training, he enjoys meditation and contemplation, finding solace in quiet moments spent reflecting on his past and contemplating his place in the world.

Emil's love for the ancient art also extends to the cultural heritage of Lithuania, with a deep respect for its history and traditions. He spends hours studying the works of KÄ™stutis, his mentor, and pouring over ancient texts and manuscripts to learn more about the techniques and tactics that have been passed down through generations.

In his free time, Emil enjoys walking in the forests surrounding Trakai, connecting with nature and clearing his mind. Despite his legendary status among the Lithuanian knights, he remains a simple man at heart, content to spend his days training and honing his skills, always striving for perfection.
