Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ivars M채gi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ivars M채gi appears to be a curious and introspective individual who values his cultural heritage. He has a deep connection to his grandfather's stories and traditions, which he inherited through his family history. This sense of legacy motivates him to explore and understand more about his roots.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Ivars is also a seeker of meaning and belonging. His chance encounter with Vana Vello at M채gi's Pub leads to a profound experience of connection to his heritage, filling a void he may have felt previously. This suggests that Ivars may be someone who has struggled with self-discovery or a sense of purpose.

However, based on the setting and atmosphere described, it can be inferred that Ivars is likely an adult in his mid-to-late life, given the way he interacts with Vana Vello. He may also have a somewhat rugged or weathered appearance, reflecting his exposure to winter conditions.

1. Cultural heritage: As a direct descendant of an Estonian woodworker, Ivars is deeply interested in the stories and traditions passed down through his family.
2. History: Through his grandfather's tales, Ivars has developed a passion for understanding and exploring the history of Estonia.
3. Music (violin playing/violin making): His connection to Vana Vello and the tradition of violin-making reveals an interest in music, particularly as it relates to his heritage.

Other possible interests might include:

1. Craftsmanship: Ivars' grandfather was a woodworker, so he may have developed a respect for traditional craftsmanship.
2. Local history: As someone connected to M채gi's Pub, which seems to be steeped in local history and tradition, Ivars may take an interest in learning more about the stories and events of his community.
