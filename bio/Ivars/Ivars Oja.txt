Personality: Ivars is a complex and enigmatic individual, with a deep sense of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior. He has honed his skills as a master of disguise over the years, allowing him to blend into any crowd and adopt new personas at will. However, this ability to adapt and pretend also makes it difficult for him to form genuine connections with others. Despite this, Ivars is deeply drawn to those around him, particularly Aria, who sees beyond his mask and touches his heart.

However, his encounter with Aria marks a turning point in his life, as he begins to open up and confront his deepest fears.

Overall, Ivars Oja is a deeply complex character whose mysterious past and troubled present are slowly being unraveled by the love and acceptance of Aria.
