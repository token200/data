Here's a summary of Ivars Yun's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ivars is a complex and intriguing individual with a charming fa√ßade. Beneath his suave exterior lies a dark past marked by loneliness and hardship. He has an uncanny ability to blend in and adapt to new situations, which serves him well as a skilled thief and con artist. Despite this, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and is driven by a desire for connection and understanding.

**Physical Attributes:** Ivars stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, allowing him to move stealthily through the city. His hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy manner, framing his sharp features. His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to hold a thousand secrets, as if reflecting the depths of his own soul. He has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist, a symbol he acquired during his tumultuous youth on the streets.

**Interests:** Ivars is drawn to activities that require cunning, strategy, and quick thinking. As a skilled thief and con artist, he enjoys navigating complex social situations and outsmarting his marks. He is also fascinated by the art of deception and the psychology behind human behavior. In his free time, he might enjoy playing chess or other strategy games, as they mirror his own mental agility.

However, with Akane's arrival in his life, Ivars' interests begin to shift towards more personal pursuits. He develops a taste for adventure and starts exploring Tokyo's hidden corners, seeking new experiences that bring him closer to Akane.
