Here's a summary of the fictional character Ivars Bj√∂rkqvist:

**Physical Attributes:** Ivars is a man in his mid-to-late 30s with an rugged and weathered appearance, reflecting his years as a private investigator. He stands at around 6 feet (183 cm) tall, which gives him an imposing presence, but his worn features suggest otherwise. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to hold a world of experience and introspection. Ivars has a distinctive jawline and a few days' worth of stubble, hinting at a no-nonsense attitude.

**Personality:** Ivars is a seasoned private investigator with a dry sense of humor and an air of quiet confidence. He's seen the darkest corners of Stockholm and has developed a thick skin to cope with the constant exposure to human suffering. Despite this tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and empathy beneath his rough exterior. Ivars is driven by a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to uncover the truth, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.

**Interests:** Ivars' work as a private investigator keeps him consumed most of the time, but when he's not on the case, he enjoys the simple pleasures of life. He's an avid coffee drinker and can often be found ordering black coffee at his favorite cafes. Ivars is also an amateur outdoorsman who finds solace in exploring the frozen landscapes of Stockholm during the harsh winters. In rare moments of leisure, he might enjoy reading a book or listening to music, but these indulgences are few and far between, given the demands of his work.

**Additional Details:** Given his background as a private investigator, Ivars likely has a strong network of contacts and informants that provide him with valuable information. He's also an expert in surveillance and forensic analysis, having worked on several high-profile cases in the past. Despite his tough exterior, Ivars seems to have a soft spot for those who've been wronged by society, as evidenced by his willingness to take on Anna's case without hesitation.
