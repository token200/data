Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ivars Krūmiņš' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ivars Krūmiņš is a ruthless and cunning individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He is calculated and cold, with a reputation for being one step ahead of the law. Despite this, he also shows moments of frustration and anger, as seen when he receives news that one of his shipments has been intercepted by the border guards. However, these outbursts are quickly suppressed as he focuses on finding a solution to the problem.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no details about Ivars' physical appearance are mentioned in the story. Therefore, I will make an educated guess:

* Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), which would be consistent with the description of him towering over Jānis when he stands up.
* Eye Color: Dark brown or black, possibly with a hint of blue to suggest a Latvian heritage.

**Interests:** Based on his line of work and reputation as a notorious gangster, it can be inferred that Ivars' interests are centered around:

* Illicit goods smuggling
* Extortion and other forms of organized crime
* Maintaining power and control over his organization
* Staying one step ahead of the authorities

Outside of these interests, no specific details about Ivars' personal life or hobbies are mentioned in the story.
