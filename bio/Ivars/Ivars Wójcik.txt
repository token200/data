Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ivars Wójcik's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm) - tall and lean, allowing him to blend into his surroundings with ease.
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with mischief, a trait often associated with master thieves and con artists.

**Personality:**

Ivars is a master thief, a chameleon, and a ghost – known for his uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings. He is confident, calculated, and always one step ahead of his adversaries. His cold demeanor hides a cunning mind and an unyielding ambition, making him a force to be reckoned with in the world of high-stakes thievery.

**Interests:**

Ivars' primary interest lies in the art of deception and disguise, honed through years of training from his father, a traveling performer. He takes great pleasure in mastering new skills, experimenting with different disguises, and pushing himself to new limits. Ivars is drawn to the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline that comes with pulling off a daring heist.

He also seems to have an interest in the mysterious artifact that he stole from The Patron, as hinted by his confident assertion that he will be calling the shots from now on. This suggests that he has a fascination with power and its implications, possibly setting him up for future adventures and conflicts.

It is worth noting that Ivars' interests may extend beyond just thievery to exploring the ethics and moral gray areas of his actions, given The Patron's cryptic message about those who would stop at nothing to claim what's mine.
