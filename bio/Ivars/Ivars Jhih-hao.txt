**Personality:** Ivar appears to be a curious and open-minded individual. He has a passion for learning and embracing different culinary techniques and traditions. His experiences in France have broadened his perspective, but he still holds onto the comfort food of his childhood. This duality suggests that Ivar values both precision and harmony in cooking, as well as adapting to new ideas while staying true to his roots.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details on Ivar's physical appearance. However, based on the cultural context and the fact that he works with Old Chen, a master of Taiwanese cuisine, it is likely that Ivar has an East Asian complexion (presumably Taiwanese or Chinese). He may be slightly above average height, around 5'10" to 6'0" (178 cm to 183 cm), which would allow him to move comfortably in the bustling streets of Taipei. His eye color could be brown or a combination of brown and green, common in East Asian cultures.

**Interests:** Ivar is deeply passionate about cooking and exploring the intersection of different culinary traditions. He has a strong appreciation for Taiwanese cuisine, having learned it from Old Chen, but also has a deep respect for French technique, which he gained during his time as a sous chef in Paris. His interests lie at the intersection of these two worlds, where he seeks to blend precision and harmony to create something unique and delicious.
