**Personality:**
Madeleine appears to be a introspective and emotional person who has struggled with feelings of restlessness and grief after her mother's passing. She is also shown to be resilient, determined, and possibly strong-willed, as she finds the strength within herself to rebuild and move forward.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Madeleine's height is not specified in the story, but based on the context of the scene where she stands at the window feeling a sense of hope, it can be inferred that she may be slightly taller than average, perhaps around 5'8"-6'0".
* Eye Color: Madeleine's eye color is not mentioned in the story, but given the somber and introspective nature of the narrative, her eyes might be blue or hazel.

**Interests:**
Although the story doesn't explicitly state Madeleine's interests, it can be inferred that she values her connection to her childhood home and heritage. She seems to find solace in reconnecting with her roots and exploring the woods where she spent her youth, suggesting a love for nature and possibly outdoor activities such as hiking or bird-watching.

It is also possible that Madeleine's interests lie in family history and genealogy, given the significance of Ravenswood as a place where she grew up. Her desire to "untangle the threads of her past" suggests a curiosity about her own ancestry and a drive to learn more about her mother's life and experiences.
