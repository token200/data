Here is a summary of Reuben Weissner's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Reuben Weissner is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, he appears to be a driven and focused person consumed by his work as an architect. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a man who struggles with anxiety and depression, which has taken over his life for many years. Despite his success, Reuben is emotionally guarded and has built walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close to him. Nevertheless, he is deeply loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to support and protect them.

**Physical Attributes:** Reuben Weissner is a tall man in his late 50s or early 60s, with an unkempt beard that he hasn't trimmed in years. His hair is thinning on top, giving him a slightly balding appearance, but he has a rugged, weathered face that speaks to his many years of hard work and dedication to his craft. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up. Despite his rough exterior, there is an intensity and passion in his eyes that hints at the depth of emotion beneath.

**Interests:** Reuben Weissner's primary interest is architecture and design, which has consumed him for most of his adult life. He is a skilled architect with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of building design principles. However, beyond this, Reuben's interests are relatively limited, reflecting the isolation he has maintained from the world for so long. His love of books and sketchpads, however, suggests that he enjoys creative pursuits and may have had artistic inclinations before his focus on architecture became all-consuming.
