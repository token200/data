Based on the provided inspiration, I've created a fictional character profile for Reuben Kabylbekova:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep indigo blue, almost purple in shade
* Hair: Rich, dark brown with subtle hints of chestnut, often worn in loose, effortless waves down her back
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a warm golden undertone from years of spending time outdoors

**Personality:**

Reuben Kabylbekova is a creative force to be reckoned with, possessing an unwavering passion for self-expression and a deep commitment to using her art as a tool for social change. She is fiercely intelligent and intensely curious, always seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible in her work. Reuben is also deeply introspective, with a strong connection to her own emotions and experiences that she channels into her art.

At the same time, Reuben has a warm and compassionate heart, radiating kindness and empathy towards others. She is an active listener, often preferring to observe and listen rather than speak, and is fiercely loyal to those she considers friends. Despite her artistic success, Reuben remains humble and grounded, always willing to learn from others and adapt to new ideas.

**Interests:**

* Art (of course!), but also a deep love of literature, philosophy, and spirituality
* Hiking and nature walks, which inspire many of her outdoor-themed sculptures and paintings
* Music (Reuben is an avid fan of folk and world music), often listening to vinyl records in her studio while creating
* Reading about social justice movements and historical events that have shaped the world, which informs much of her art's focus on equality and human rights

**Hobbies:**

* Writing poetry and short stories, which she considers a way of processing her emotions and thoughts
* Experimenting with different mediums and techniques in her art studio (from painting to sculpture, from printmaking to collage)
* Practicing yoga and meditation as a means of connecting with her own inner self and finding creative inspiration

Overall, Reuben Kabylbekova is an extraordinary individual whose creativity, compassion, and commitment to social justice make her a shining light in the art world.
