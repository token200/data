Here's a summary of the fictional character Reuben Nielsen:

**Physical Attributes:** Reuben is a tall and imposing figure, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean yet muscular build. His piercing blue eyes are a striking feature that seems to see right through you, giving off an aura of intensity and calculation. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly, and he has a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which suggests a tough past.

**Personality:** Reuben is a complex and enigmatic individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears to be a friendly and welcoming bartender who is genuinely interested in getting to know his customers. However, those who know him sense that there's more to him than meets the eye. He has an unnerving intensity and a way of listening that is both empathetic and calculating, as if he can hear every whispered secret and calculate the risks. Despite this, he also seems to have a dry sense of humor and a quick wit, which makes him a fascinating and intriguing person to be around.

**Interests:** Reuben's interests are varied and complex, reflecting his checkered past as a hitman. He enjoys listening to jazz music, particularly Miles Davis, and is an avid reader of literature and philosophy. He also has a passion for whiskey, often experimenting with different blends and flavors at the bar. As he gets to know Sarah, Reuben reveals a more introspective side, enjoying long walks in the woods and contemplative conversations about life and mortality.

**Background:** Despite his tough exterior, Reuben has a complex and troubled past as a hitman. He has seen his fair share of violence and bloodshed, but has long since retired from the trade, seeking a quieter life in Willow Creek. His exact motivations for leaving the profession are unclear, but it's evident that he's trying to leave his past behind him and start anew.
