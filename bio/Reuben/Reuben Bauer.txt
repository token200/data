Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Reuben Bauer:

**Personality:** Reuben is a introspective and creative individual who has struggled with self-doubt and uncertainty. He is haunted by a brutal critique from a prominent gallery owner that left him questioning his talent and feeling lost. Despite this, he is determined and resilient, with a strong desire to rediscover his passion for art. He is also shown to be fiercely independent and able to appreciate solitude, but is not opposed to seeking comfort and support from friends like Rachel.

**Physical Attributes:** Reuben appears to be in his mid-30s, with an unassuming presence that allows him to blend into the background. He has a medium height (around 5'9") and slender build, which may have been overshadowed by his creative ambitions in the past. His eye color is a deep brown, which seems almost melancholic given his current state of mind.

**Interests:** Reuben's primary interest is art, particularly painting and drawing. He spent countless hours as a child watching his parents work in their studio and dreaming of creating something beautiful himself. As an adult, he still finds solace in creative pursuits, even if he hasn't been actively producing art for some time. He also seems to appreciate the comfort and familiarity of rainy days, finding them conducive to introspection and contemplation.

**Habits:** Reuben appears to be a solitary figure who values his alone time, often seeking out cafes or other public places as a refuge from the rain and his own thoughts. Despite this, he is willing to engage with others when needed, particularly friends like Rachel who offer him support and encouragement.

Overall, Reuben's personality, physical attributes, and interests all seem to be intertwined by his love of art and his desire to recapture his creative spark.
