Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Reuben Karlsson:

**Physical Attributes:** Reuben is a tall and imposing figure, standing at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build that hints at his past as a detective. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for any sign of deception. His dark hair is often unkempt, framing a face that is both rugged and worn.

**Personality:** Reuben is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor that can be both captivating and unsettling. As a former detective, he's seen the darkest aspects of human nature and has developed a world-weariness that borders on cynicism. Despite this, there's an underlying intensity to him, a drive that propels him forward even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. He's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance, which serves him well in his investigations.

**Interests:** Reuben is intensely interested in solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries, often to the point of obsession. His work as a detective has honed this skill, but he also applies it to his personal life, seeking out challenges that test his analytical mind. He's an avid reader, devouring books on criminology, psychology, and philosophy, which help him better understand the motivations behind human behavior. In his free time, Reuben enjoys long walks in nature, particularly in areas with a rugged, natural beauty â€“ much like the desolate landscape he finds himself trudging through.

Reuben's investigations also seem to be motivated by a deeper desire to understand himself and his place in the world. As someone who has walked away from the force, he's searching for meaning and purpose, using the darkness of human nature to guide him toward self-discovery. This internal conflict is evident throughout the story, as Reuben grapples with the realization that his true enemy may be within himself rather than an external foe.
