Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Reuben Novák:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark, piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you
* Hair: Jet-black hair that falls to his shoulders in loose, unruly waves
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a collection of scars on his arms and torso that tell stories of their own

**Personality:**

Reuben Novák is an enigmatic and introspective individual who wears his heart on his sleeve through his art. He is a deeply emotional and empathetic person, able to tap into the darkest recesses of human experience and channel them onto canvas. His inner turmoil and struggles with addiction have given him a unique perspective on the world, allowing him to create works that are both hauntingly beautiful and profoundly redemptive.

Despite his tumultuous past, Reuben is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, and will go to great lengths to protect and support them. He is also intensely self-critical, often beating himself up over perceived failures or shortcomings. This tendency towards self-doubt can make him come across as introverted or even aloof to outsiders.

**Interests:**

Reuben Novák has a deep passion for art, music, and literature. He is particularly drawn to the works of the Romantic poets and the darker corners of Surrealism. His favorite authors include Edgar Allan Poe and Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas on existentialism and the human condition resonate deeply with him.

When not creating art, Reuben can be found lost in the pages of a novel or wandering through abandoned streets at night, searching for inspiration. He is also an avid collector of rare books and curiosities, often scouring thrift stores and antique shops for unique artifacts to incorporate into his work.

Musically, Reuben has a fondness for classical piano music and the haunting melodies of ambient electronica. He finds solace in the sonic landscapes created by artists like Max Richter and Tim Hecker, whose atmospheric soundscapes mirror the dark, introspective emotions that fuel his art.
