Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Maximilian "Max" Errani:

**Personality:** Max is a master manipulator with an air of confidence that borders on arrogance. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a world of secrets, giving him an aura of mystery and intrigue. Despite his tough exterior, he has a complex past that has shaped him into the person he is today. He is cunning, intelligent, and calculating, always staying one step ahead of his adversaries.

**Physical Attributes:** Max stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build that belies his ruthless nature. His sharp jawline and chiseled features give him an intimidating presence, while his piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often slicked back, revealing a prominent forehead and nose.

**Interests:** Max's true passion lies in art, particularly Renaissance masterpieces. He has a deep appreciation for the beauty and craftsmanship of these works, which he believes can be appreciated by anyone. By night, he would sneak into galleries and museums to steal masterpieces, not just for financial gain but also to appreciate them in the context of his own illicit world.

In his free time, Max enjoys the thrill of the art world's underbelly â€“ the hidden passageways, secret doors, and high-stakes dealings that lie beneath the surface. He is always on the lookout for new targets, whether they be wealthy collectors or rival thieves, and will stop at nothing to outwit and outmaneuver his enemies.

Despite his love of art, Max's life is one of shadows and secrets, with a constant need to stay hidden from those who would seek to expose him. His nickname "il Fantasma" (the Ghost) reflects his ability to evade capture and disappear into the night, leaving behind only whispers of his presence.
