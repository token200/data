**Personality:**
Maximilian White is a creative and determined individual with a passion for art that drives him to pursue his dreams. He is fiercely independent and can come across as introverted or aloof at times, but once you get to know him, he opens up and reveals a witty sense of humor and a kind heart. Max has high standards for himself and can be quite hard on himself when things don't go as planned, but this self-criticism fuels his determination to succeed.

**Interests:**
Maximilian White is deeply interested in art, music, literature, and the natural world. He finds inspiration in the world around him, from the intricate patterns of leaves to the swirling clouds in the sky. When not creating art, Max enjoys hiking through the woods, exploring abandoned buildings, and reading classic novels by authors like Dickens and Hemingway.

In terms of hobbies, Max is an avid sketchbook collector, always on the lookout for unique paper textures and artist-friendly notebooks. He also has a weakness for old cameras and vintage photography equipment, often experimenting with new techniques to capture breathtaking images of the natural world. Despite his many interests, art remains his true passion, and he devotes countless hours to honing his craft and pushing himself to innovate.
