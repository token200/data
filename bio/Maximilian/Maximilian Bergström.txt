**Personality:** Maximilian is a brilliant and curious scientist with an intense passion for discovery. He is driven by a desire to uncover the secrets of the past and is willing to risk everything to achieve his goals. However, his obsession has begun to take a toll on his personal life, causing him to neglect relationships and sleep patterns. This raises questions about the cost of his ambition and whether it's worth sacrificing one's well-being.

**Physical Attributes:** Maximilian is not described in great detail, but we can infer some information from the story:

* Height: He is likely around 6'0" (183 cm) tall, as he stands at the edge of a frozen lake without any notable difficulties.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not mentioned, but based on his Scandinavian background and professional setting, it's possible that he has blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** Maximilian's primary interest is uncovering the secrets of Lake Storön and unlocking its mysterious properties. He is also fascinated by the scientific aspects of the phenomenon and is driven to understand the unusual mineral deposits and their reaction to his presence. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that there may be more to his interest than meets the eye, suggesting that he may have personal or even supernatural motivations for his research.

It's worth noting that Maximilian's interests are not just about science, but also about uncovering a deeper truth and perhaps understanding something that has been hidden for centuries. His fascination with the unknown and his willingness to take risks suggest that he is driven by a sense of curiosity and wonder.
