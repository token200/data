Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Maximilian Cannavaro:

**Personality:** Maximilian is a complex character with an air of confidence that borders on arrogance. He has an uncanny ability to sniff out trouble from a mile away, which stems from his years as a professional footballer turned private investigator. Despite his tough exterior, he is haunted by a tragic past and is driven to seek redemption in the world of detective work.

**Physical Attributes:** Maximilian stands at 6'2" with a sharp jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is always perfectly styled, and he has a lean, athletic build that hints at his footballing past. He often wears stylishly tailored suits and carries himself with an air of sophistication.

**Interests:** Maximilian's primary interest is in solving mysteries and uncovering the truth, which drives him to become a private investigator. He is intensely curious and enjoys piecing together seemingly unrelated clues to reveal a larger picture. Outside of work, he appears to have little interest in leisure activities or hobbies, preferring to focus on his cases and personal growth.

One might also note that Maximilian's interests could extend to football (or soccer), given his background as a professional player, but this is not explicitly stated in the original short story.
