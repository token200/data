**Personality:** Max is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a charismatic and confident exterior. However, beneath his polished facade lies a deeply introspective and vulnerable person who struggles to form genuine connections with others. He has a natural talent for manipulation, which he has honed over years of navigating the underworld as a thief and con artist. Despite this, Max is fiercely determined to leave his past behind and build a new life as a respectable businessman.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2"
* Eye Color: Piercing green (a trait that seems almost unnatural, adding to his enigmatic presence)
* Hair Color: Dark brown (always impeccably styled)
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a toned physique honed from years of street life

**Interests:** As a former thief and con artist, Max has always been drawn to high-stakes games and intellectual pursuits. He is an avid collector of rare and exotic art pieces, which he uses as a way to showcase his refined taste. He also enjoys fine dining, traveling, and reading classical literature. Despite his polished exterior, Max still retains a love for risk-taking and the thrill of living on the edge.

However, with his newfound interest in the enigmatic woman from Central Park, it appears that Max is beginning to expand his horizons and explore new interests beyond his underworld connections. He may be developing a romantic interest in her, which could signal a significant shift in his life and personality.
