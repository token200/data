However, beneath her tough exterior lies a creative and emotional soul, eager to express herself through art. She's introspective and perceptive, often picking up on subtle cues that others miss.

**Interests:** As an artist, Grace has always been passionate about exploring the human experience through various mediums, including painting, sculpture, and photography. She's drawn to themes of identity, belonging, and social justice, which she hopes to convey in her work. Outside of art, she enjoys reading, hiking, and practicing yoga to maintain a sense of balance in her life.

She left for college and pursued a degree in fine arts, seeking adventure and creativity in the city. However, after a painful breakup and struggling with dead-end jobs, she returned to Willow Creek, feeling lost and uncertain about her future.

Despite these challenges, Grace remains optimistic and determined to make a new life for herself in her hometown. She's not sure what the future holds, but she's willing to take the leap and rediscover herself in the process.
