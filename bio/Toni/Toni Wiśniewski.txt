Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Toni Wiśniewski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Toni Wiśniewski is a quiet and introspective individual who prefers to let her art speak for itself. She has an unorthodox approach to art and is not afraid to challenge conventions. Despite her reserved nature, those who know her understand that she has a deep sense of curiosity and wonder that drives her creative process.

**Physical Attributes:** Toni Wiśniewski stands at 5'8" with piercing green eyes that seem to sparkle with creativity. Her dark brown hair is often tousled and unkempt, giving her an air of relaxed sophistication. She has a wiry yet athletic build, honed from years of working in the junkyard and hauling heavy materials for her art projects.

**Interests:** Toni Wiśniewski's interests are closely tied to her passion for art and creativity. She is fascinated by the intersection of functionality and form, often incorporating recycled materials into her sculptures. Her love for old cars and machinery is evident in "Dis integration," which showcases her unique ability to breathe new life into discarded objects.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Toni Wiśniewski is also an avid collector of vintage car parts and scrap metal. She finds solace in the junkyard's chaos, where she can lose herself among the rusty hulks and worn-out engines. Her fascination with history and the stories behind each object drives her creative process, as she seeks to unravel the narratives hidden within the discarded.

When not working on a new piece or exploring the local junkyard, Toni Wiśniewski can be found in her small studio, surrounded by half-finished sculptures and scattered sketches. She is an intensely focused individual who prefers quiet contemplation over lively social gatherings, but those who earn her trust are rewarded with a glimpse into her vibrant inner world.
