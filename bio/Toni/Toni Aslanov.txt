Here's a summary of the fictional character Toni Aslanov:

**Physical Attributes:** Toni is a tall and lean man in his late 40s, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a rugged, weathered face. His eyes are a deep brown, fringed with thick lashes that hint at his years of working in the shadows. His dark hair is flecked with grey, often slicked back to reveal a prominent forehead and sharp jawline.

**Personality:** Toni is a complex, brooding individual with a dry sense of humor and a penchant for sarcasm. He's fiercely intelligent and has an insatiable curiosity, which drives him to dig deeper into the most seemingly impenetrable mysteries. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep sense of empathy and compassion, particularly towards those who have been victimized by the state. Toni is also intensely loyal to those he trusts, and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, Toni's interests are diverse and often overlap with his work. He's fascinated by politics, history, and the intricacies of international relations. In his free time, he enjoys reading classic literature, particularly the works of Russian authors like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Toni is also an avid coffee connoisseur and can often be found sipping on a strong espresso at Moscow's dingy bars and cafes.

**Additional Details:** Despite his rough exterior, Toni has a deep love for poetry and music, which he had to abandon during his KGB years. He still keeps a secret journal where he writes haikus and short poems, hoping one day to rediscover the creative outlet that was lost to him during his service.
