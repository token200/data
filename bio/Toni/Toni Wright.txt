Here is a summary of Toni Wright's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Toni Wright is a fiercely determined and passionate individual. She has a strong sense of grit and resilience, having overcome significant challenges in her past to find new purpose in life. As a coach, she is intense, driven, and has high expectations for herself and others. Despite this tough exterior, she has a softer side that emerges when working with young players - she is nurturing, encouraging, and genuinely invested in their growth.

**Physical Attributes:** Toni Wright stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with a lean and athletic build honed from years of competitive tennis. Her eyes are a bright blue color, with a piercing intensity that seems to bore into those she meets. Her hair is a dark blonde color, often styled in a short, practical cut that suits her active lifestyle.

**Interests:** Toni Wright's interests revolve around tennis and helping others grow and develop through sports. As a coach, she is deeply invested in the personal growth of her players, and sees coaching as an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy on young lives. She is also passionate about promoting tennis programs for underprivileged kids, using her own experiences of overcoming adversity to inspire others. Outside of tennis, Toni enjoys traveling, reading about history, and practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental well-being.

In terms of hobbies or leisure activities, I imagine that Toni Wright enjoys hiking, playing board games with friends, and watching classic movies - anything that allows her to unwind and recharge after a long day on the court or in the coaching box.
