He is fascinated by art movements, historical periods, and cultural nuances that might shed light on the origins and significance of an artifact.

**Quirks:** Toni has a few quirks that are worth mentioning:

* He is known for wearing a simple silver watch with an intricately engraved case back in the workshop, which he believes helps him stay focused.
* When working on a particularly challenging restoration, Toni often finds himself muttering to himself or softly humming a tune – a coping mechanism he developed over the years to calm his nerves and focus his mind.
* He has a weakness for coffee, often brewing cups for himself after a long day of work in his workshop.
