Here is a summary of Mihir Leroy's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Mihir is a tall and lean man in his mid-40s, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with a fit and athletic build. His hair is dark brown and neatly combed, and his eyes are a piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a strong jawline, but it's softened by the weight of responsibility, giving him a more tired and worn look.

**Personality:** Mihir is a driven and ambitious individual who is consumed by his work. As CEO of his family's textile empire, he is fiercely dedicated to his vision for the company's success, which he believes will make it the largest textile manufacturer in India. Despite his long hours and crushing pressure, Mihir remains razor-sharp mentally, always thinking several steps ahead. However, this focus on work has also made him a bit reserved and guarded, especially around people who challenge his views.

**Interests:** As CEO of his family's textile empire, Mihir is naturally interested in the textiles industry, particularly innovation and technology that can improve manufacturing efficiency and quality. He also cares deeply about economic growth and job creation, which motivates him to expand his company into new markets. Outside of work, Mihir doesn't seem to have much time or interest for personal pursuits, but he does have a deep respect for people who share his vision for the future and are willing to challenge him.

It's worth noting that Mihir has a more guarded side, especially around people like Rohini, who dares to question his vision. However, when given the chance to work with someone who shares his passion and expertise, he becomes more energetic and determined, as shown in his encounter with Rohini.
