He is also fiercely driven and willing to take risks when the stakes are high.

**Interests:** As a historian specializing in forgotten cultures, Mihir's interests revolve primarily around:

1. Researching and studying long-forgotten civilizations
2. Deciphering ancient scripts and languages
3. Exploring historical artifacts and relics
4. Uncovering hidden secrets and mysteries from the past

Additionally, his experience as a researcher has likely sparked an interest in exploration and travel, particularly to areas with rich cultural heritage such as the Amazon rainforest.
