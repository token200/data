Mihir stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His dark hair is often styled neatly, framing his heart-shaped face and bright brown eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident.

**Personality:**
Mihir is an ambitious and driven individual, always striving to tell the stories that need to be told. His quick wit and sharp instincts make him an excellent journalist, but it's his empathy and understanding of people's perspectives that allows him to build trust with sources and colleagues alike. He's fiercely independent and determined, willing to put in long hours to get the job done right.

**Interests:**
Outside of journalism, Mihir is passionate about music (he plays the guitar and enjoys indie rock) and hiking. On his days off, you can find him exploring the trails of Los Angeles or trying out new restaurants with friends. He's also an avid reader, devouring books on history, politics, and social justice. Despite his busy schedule, Mihir makes time for online learning, staying up-to-date on current events and developments in his field.

As he looks to continue growing as a journalist, Mihir is drawn to cases that involve social inequality, corruption, or systemic injustice. His strong sense of morality and commitment to uncovering the truth drives him to tell stories that might be uncomfortable or challenging for some readers.
