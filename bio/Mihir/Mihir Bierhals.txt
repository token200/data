Physical Attributes: Mihir stands at approximately 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing green eyes seem to be an unsettling intensity, as if they bore into those he meets, sizing them up and searching for hidden vulnerabilities. His dark brown hair is typically worn neatly, framing his angular face and sharp jawline.

Personality: Mihir exudes an air of quiet confidence that commands attention without requiring it. He appears introspective and calculating, with a deep-seated determination to succeed at any cost. Despite this drive, he remains an enigma, never revealing too much about himself or his past. Those who know him describe him as being intensely intelligent and perceptive, but also guarded and private.

Interests: As a master of the ancient arts of magic and diplomacy, Mihir's interests revolve around the study and application of arcane knowledge. He is deeply fascinated by the mysterious forces that shape reality and seeks to understand the intricacies of the cosmos. His patronage by powerful figures suggests that he has an interest in politics and strategy as well, often navigating complex webs of alliances and rivalries.

Additional Details: Mihir's modest upbringing likely instilled a strong sense of self-reliance and resilience in him, driving his fierce determination to succeed. Despite his growing influence, he appears driven by a desire for knowledge and understanding, rather than personal gain or material wealth. This blend of intelligence, strategic thinking, and mystical awareness makes Mihir Bierhals an intriguing figure with the potential to reshape the world around him.
