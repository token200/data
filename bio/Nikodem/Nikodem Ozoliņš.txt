Since Nikodem Ozoliņš appears to be a fictional character, I will create a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests. Based on the name, I assume that he is likely of Eastern European or Baltic descent.

**Physical Attributes:**
Nikodem Ozoliņš stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic build. He has short, dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His features are strong and angular, giving him a rugged yet charming appearance. Nikodem sports a scruffy beard that he often strokes when deep in thought.

**Personality:**
Nikodem is a complex individual with a mix of traits that make him both intriguing and intimidating. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, once you gain his trust, he reveals a deep sense of loyalty and commitment to those he cares about. Nikodem is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. He has a sharp mind and is always on the lookout for new challenges and puzzles to solve.

**Interests:**
Nikodem has a passion for history, particularly the study of Eastern European cultures and politics. He's an avid reader of books on philosophy, psychology, and cryptography. In his free time, he enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and playing chess. Nikodem is also an accomplished musician and plays the guitar with incredible skill.

Please note that these attributes are purely fictional and created based on the name and assuming a character profile. If you'd like to create a story around Nikodem Ozoliņš, I'd be happy to help!
