Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Nikodem Borromeo's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Nikodem is likely an analytical and detail-oriented person. As someone who has always been more interested in the business side of things, he may have developed strong problem-solving skills and a logical approach to challenges. However, this doesn't necessarily translate well to being passionate about literature. His ability to adapt and pivot when faced with unexpected outcomes (e.g., successfully creating a social media campaign) suggests that Nikodem is resourceful and open to learning.

**Physical Attributes:**
Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide explicit details on Nikodem's physical appearance. However, based on his profession as a marketing expert for a publishing house, it's possible that he dresses professionally and may have a more subdued sense of style compared to those in creative or artistic fields.

Given the context of the story, let's make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - This height seems typical for a professional working in an office setting.
* Eye Color: Brown - A brown eye color is common among people with European ancestry, which might be fitting given Nikodem's background as the son of a publishing house owner.

**Interests:**
While Nikodom doesn't seem to have a strong interest in literature (per se), he demonstrates a keen understanding of social media and online trends. As someone who has successfully leveraged these platforms to promote his publishing house, it's likely that he:

* Enjoys staying up-to-date with the latest social media trends and technologies
* Has an interest in marketing and branding strategies for businesses or creative endeavors
* Appreciates data-driven insights and analytics (given his success in creating a successful social media campaign)
* May enjoy collecting books or having a casual interest in literature, albeit not as an aficionado
