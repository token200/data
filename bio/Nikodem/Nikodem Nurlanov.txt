Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Nikodom Nurlanov:

**Physical Attributes:** Nikod stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a muscular build that reflects his athletic background. His piercing brown eyes seem to bore into those he meets, making him an intimidating figure on the streets of Tashkent. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rugged, enigmatic persona.

**Personality:** Nikod is a complex individual with a mix of fierce determination and deep-seated emotional scars. Growing up in poverty has hardened him, but it's also fueled his desire for survival and success. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries. Despite this tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and loyalty to those he cares about.

**Interests:** Nikod's passion lies in the world of combat sports, particularly wrestling and street fighting. He is drawn to the physical and mental challenges these disciplines present, which allow him to channel his emotions and test his limits. His experiences as an athlete have taught him discipline, strategy, and the importance of adaptability â€“ skills he uses both in and out of the ring.

Outside of combat sports, Nikod appears to be a private individual with few close relationships or hobbies. He is haunted by his past and seems driven by a need for validation and redemption. This sense of longing makes him an intriguing figure, as he walks the fine line between his rough exterior and the emotional depth that lies beneath.

One aspect of Nikod's personality that remains unexplored in this summary is his relationship with his long-lost brother, who has recently reappeared on the scene. How will this revelation impact his life and motivations? Only time will tell.
