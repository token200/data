Here is a summary of Nikodem Piotrowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nikodem Piotrowska is a determined and resourceful individual who has developed a strong sense of instinct over his years as an undercover cop. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to trust his gut over rational thinking. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect the innocent. Nikodem's experiences with organized crime have left emotional scars, but he remains driven by a strong sense of justice.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, worn look
* Build: Athletic and toned from years of physical activity

**Interests:** As a former member of the Polish mafia and now a private investigator, Nikodem's interests lie at the intersection of crime-solving and personal investigation. He is meticulous and analytical, with a keen eye for detail. In his free time, he enjoys reading about history, particularly the complexities of Eastern European politics during World War II. This fascination stems from his own complicated past, which he has only begun to unravel since leaving organized crime behind.

Nikodem's personal life is limited, as his work often takes precedence over his relationships and hobbies. However, when given the chance, he enjoys exploring abandoned buildings and taking long walks through the city at night, allowing him to clear his mind and process his thoughts.

It's worth noting that Nikodem's past experiences have left him with a few distinguishing scars: a small tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist, a silver earring in the shape of a Polish eagle on his left ear, and a distinctive limp in his left leg due to an injury sustained during one of his undercover operations.
