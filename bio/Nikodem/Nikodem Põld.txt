Based on your request, I've created a fictional character profile for Nikodem Põld.

**Physical Attributes:**
Nikodem Põld is of average height, standing at around 175 cm (5'9"). He has short, dark brown hair that's often neatly trimmed, and his eyes are a deep shade of blue. His facial features are strong and angular, with high cheekbones and a small nose.

**Personality:**
Nikodem is a introverted and analytical person who values precision and attention to detail. He's a natural problem-solver and enjoys unraveling complex puzzles or mysteries. Despite his reserved nature, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation calls for it. Nikodem is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging traditional norms and conventions.

**Interests:**
Nikodem is passionate about botany, particularly entomology (the study of insects). He's an avid collector of rare insect specimens and spends much of his free time studying their habits and habitats. In his younger years, he was also an accomplished rock climber, but he's since shifted his focus to more intellectually stimulating pursuits.
