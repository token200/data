Here is a summary of Nikodem Rousseau's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nikodem is a complex individual with a mix of artistic passion and family duty. He is driven by a desire to express himself freely, but also feels a sense of responsibility to uphold the legacy of his esteemed House of Valmont. This internal conflict gives him a sense of tension and introspection, which he navigates through moments of creative expression. Despite this, Nikodem seems determined and resolute, with a strong will to balance his artistic ambitions with his family obligations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, almost sky-blue, with a hint of golden sparkle that seems to catch the light when he's passionate about his art.
