Here's a summary of Nikodem Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Nikodem Lemoine is a complex individual with a rich inner life. He has a tough exterior that hides a deeper vulnerability and longing for connection and understanding. Despite his profession as a thief, he has a strong sense of purpose and conviction, driven by his love for philosophical ideas and a desire to live on the fringes of society.

**Physical Attributes:** Nikodem Lemoine is described as having piercing blue eyes, chiseled features, and an unspecified height (no specific measurement or unit is mentioned). His physical appearance suggests that he has been shaped by his experiences living on the margins of society, giving him a rugged and weathered look.

**Interests:**

* Nikodem's idol is French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom he finds solace in and identifies with.
* He is deeply interested in Rousseau's writings, particularly "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality," which speaks to his own experiences and values.
* His love for Rousseau's ideas suggests that Nikodem has a strong appreciation for philosophical concepts related to individual freedom, human condition, and social critique.

**Additional Details:** As an added detail, I'll fill in some gaps from the original text:

* Family: Nikodom Lemoine grew up in a world where resources were scarce and opportunities few. This upbringing may have contributed to his resourcefulness and cunning as a thief.
* Appearance of lair: The dimly lit lair is described as being filled with maps, lockpicks, and other tools of his trade. It's likely that Nikodem takes pride in maintaining this environment, which serves as both a workspace and a sanctuary.
