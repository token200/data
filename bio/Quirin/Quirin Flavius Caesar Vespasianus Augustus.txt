Despite this, he possesses strong leadership qualities and is determined to rule with justice and wisdom.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Quirin stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, slightly above average height for a Roman male of his era.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep, piercing brown that seem to bore into those he meets.
* Hair: Quirin has dark hair, which is often worn neatly trimmed and combed back from his forehead.
* Face: He has a strong, chiseled face with sharp features, giving him an air of authority and gravitas.

**Interests:** Quirin's interests seem to revolve around his duty to serve Rome and its people. He values wisdom and cunning above all else, often reflecting on the complexities of governing a vast empire. He is also deeply invested in the welfare of his wife, Domitia, and appears to be a devoted partner.
