**Interests:** Quirin Mancini's interests seem to be focused on art and creativity, with a particular emphasis on pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas. They are drawn to artists who share their passion for innovation and self-expression. They may also be interested in the mystical or spiritual aspects of art, as hinted at by Lena's feeling that Quirin Mancini's art is a reflection of a hidden world.
