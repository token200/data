Her eyes are a piercing blue, an asset she leverages as a skilled hacker. She has a scattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose, which darken when she spends more time indoors staring at screens.

**Personality:**
Leia Korolev is a fiercely independent and resourceful individual, with a strong sense of justice that drives her to take on high-stakes missions as a member of an elite group of cyber-vigilantes. She's quick-witted and charismatic, able to think on her feet and talk her way out of sticky situations.

**Interests:**
As a skilled hacker, Leia Korolev is deeply invested in the world of cybercrime and digital security. She spends countless hours honing her skills, exploring the darker corners of the internet, and staying one step ahead of her adversaries.

**Additional Details:**
Leia Korolev's past is shrouded in mystery, with few details revealed about her life before becoming a member of the elite group of cyber-vigilantes. What's known is that she was drawn to this line of work by a personal tragedy or loss, which sparked her desire for justice and drive to protect others from suffering the same fate. Her skills and reputation have earned her both admiration and fear from those in the shadows, where cybercrime and high-stakes hacking reign supreme.
