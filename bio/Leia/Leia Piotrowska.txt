**Physical Attributes:** Leia stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of intense training and high-stakes missions. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a practical yet stylish manner, and her eyes are a piercing green, a trait inherited from her Eastern European heritage.

**Personality:** Leia is a fearless and resourceful individual, known for her sharp instincts and quick thinking. She's confident to the point of being bold, but also has a compassionate side, often putting the needs of others before her own. Her reputation as a skilled operative has earned her respect from peers, but it also makes her a prime target for those seeking to exploit her skills. Despite this, Leia remains determined and driven, always striving to improve and push herself to new heights.

In her free time, she enjoys hiking and practicing yoga to maintain her physical and mental balance.

**Additional Details:** Leia has a distinctive tattoo on her left shoulder blade – a small silver star that holds sentimental value – and wears a silver watch on her right wrist, passed down from her grandmother. She's an expert markswoman and hand-to-hand combatant, with a talent for hacking and surveillance. Her personal motto is "Veritas odium parit" (Truth begets hatred), reflecting her commitment to uncovering the truth, no matter the cost.

With Nadia by her side, Leia is ready to face new challenges and push herself to even greater heights, honing her skills and exploring the depths of her own potential.
