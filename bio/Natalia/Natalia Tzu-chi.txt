As she navigates the pressures of adulthood, she struggles to balance her desire for creative expression with external expectations. However, once she discovers her talent and the support of a secret society, Nat's confidence and determination grow.

* Study dusty tomes on magic and adventure
* Weave intricate patterns into fabric
* Explore ancient knowledge and resources through her secret society mentors
