Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Natalia Luis Borges' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Natalia is a free-spirited artist with a deep passion for creativity and self-expression. She has a contemplative nature, often lost in thought as she pours her emotions onto canvas. Despite her introspective nature, she has a strong connection to others, particularly Sofía, whom she forms a close bond with over shared stories and conversations.

**Physical Attributes:** Natalia is likely in her mid-to-late twenties or early thirties, given the context of her life as an artist. Her height is unknown, but based on the story's description of her navigating through streets and entering small studios, she may be petite or average stature. Her eye color is described only metaphorically, but it can be inferred that she has expressive brown eyes, typical of many Latin American cultures. Her hair and skin tones are not explicitly mentioned in the story, so they remain ambiguous.

**Interests:** Natalia's primary interests lie in art, particularly painting and drawing. She is known for her unique style, which blends traditional techniques with modern experimentation. Beyond her artistic pursuits, she has a fascination with history, literature, and storytelling. The discovery of La Biblioteca, where she meets Sofía, marks the beginning of a new chapter in her life where she can tap into these interests through shared conversations and tales.
