Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Natalia Dupont's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Natalia is a warm-hearted and curious individual who has a strong connection to her family's history and roots. She appears to be someone who values community, tradition, and personal growth. As she spends more time in Ravenswood Cove, it becomes clear that she's been missing a sense of belonging and connection to her past. Natalia seems to have a resilient spirit, having built a successful career on the other side of the world but ultimately feeling unfulfilled.

**Physical Attributes:** Natalia is likely a woman in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, given her professional success and life experience. Her physical attributes are not explicitly described in the story, so I will make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5'7" (170 cm) - This height seems fitting for someone who moves with a sense of ease and comfort in their surroundings.
* Eye Color: Blue or green eyes - The narrator's description of the ocean's scent filling Natalia's lungs suggests a connection to nature, which might be reflected in her eye color.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it's clear that Natalia has:

1. A deep love for nature and the ocean.
2. An appreciation for history, traditions, and family stories.
3. A desire for personal growth, connection, and a sense of belonging.

Other interests might include:

* Reading (possibly her grandmother's old books or family histories)
* Artistic pursuits ( possibly inspired by her childhood explorations of tide pools)
* Supporting local businesses and community development
