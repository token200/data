**Personality:** Natalia Põld is known for her passion and dedication to preserving Estonian folk music. She is a humble and down-to-earth individual who remains true to her roots despite achieving international success.

**Physical Attributes:** Natalia Põld stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her long, dark brown hair cascades down her back like a waterfall, often adorned with intricate braids or ornaments that reflect her cultural heritage. Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost black, which seem to sparkle with an inner light when she sings from the heart.

**Interests:** Natalia Põld is deeply invested in preserving and promoting Estonian folk music, both through her own performances and collaborations with fellow artists. She also holds a strong interest in traditional Estonian crafts, such as woodworking and weaving, which often inspire her music and artistic endeavors.
