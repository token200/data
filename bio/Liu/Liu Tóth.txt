I'll provide a summary of Liu Tóth, assuming it's a fictional character from an adventure fantasy genre.

Liu Tóth is a 25-year-old half-elf rogue with an agile and enigmatic personality. He stands at about 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with piercing emerald green eyes that seem to gleam in the dark. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp jawline and pointed ears.

Liu Tóth's interests lie in stealth, acrobatics, and strategy. He is a skilled thief and con artist, always looking for ways to exploit the weaknesses of those around him. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will only use his cunning and agility to help those in need, often walking the fine line between right and wrong.

Liu Tóth hails from a city on the edge of a mystical realm, where magic and technology coexist in an intricate balance. He grew up on the streets, learning to survive by his wits and stealth. Over time, he developed a network of contacts and informants, using them to gather information and manipulate events to his advantage.

In terms of abilities, Liu Tóth is an expert in hand-to-hand combat, disguise, and deception. He can pick locks, disarm traps, and pick pockets with ease, often relying on his wit and charm to talk his way out of sticky situations. His agility and acrobatic skills allow him to navigate complex environments and avoid detection.
