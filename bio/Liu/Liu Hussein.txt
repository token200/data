Since there is no provided short story, I'll create a fictional character profile for Liu Hussein.

Liu Hussein is a 28-year-old Chinese-American who is known for his charming and introverted personality. He has a calm demeanor that can sometimes make it difficult for others to read him, but once you get to know him, he reveals a witty sense of humor and a deep empathy for those around him.

Physically, Liu Hussein stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His dark brown eyes are almond-shaped and fringed with thick lashes, giving them a captivating presence. His black hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face with a subtle hint of scruff.

Liu's interests include writing poetry, playing the guitar, and practicing martial arts. He has a passion for 20th-century literature, particularly the works of Chinese poets like Lu Xun and Du Fu. His love for music is inspired by classical Chinese instruments like the guqin and erhu. In terms of fitness, Liu is an avid practitioner of tai chi and kung fu, which he believes helps him connect with his body and find inner peace.

Outside of his creative pursuits, Liu enjoys exploring local hidden gems in his city, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, and spending time with his close-knit circle of friends. Despite his reserved nature, Liu has a deep longing to share his artistic expressions with the world and make meaningful connections with those around him.
