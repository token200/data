He has a sharp, angular face with high cheekbones and a pointed chin, giving him an otherworldly appearance.

He is a deeply introspective person, often lost in thought as he ponders the mysteries of existence. His creative mind is constantly racing, fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the nature of reality and the human condition.

Despite his intellectual pursuits, Liu Luis Borges has a dry sense of humor and can come across as somewhat misanthropic at times. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep empathy for humanity's struggles and an unwavering commitment to exploring the frontiers of knowledge.
