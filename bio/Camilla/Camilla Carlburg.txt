**Physical Attributes:** Camilla stands at 5'8" with striking features that set her apart from others. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she meets, as if sizing them up and searching for any hidden clues. Her dark hair is often pulled back in a neat ponytail, revealing a heart-shaped face and high cheekbones. She has a small tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, which hints at her passion for writing and storytelling.

She's also an avid collector of rare books and artwork, often incorporating these items into her investigations. Her passion for art is evident in the cryptic message left by the thief: "For the eyes of a true artist."
