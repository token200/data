**Physical Attributes:**
Camilla is a petite woman in her mid-30s to early 40s. Her height is around 5'2" (157 cm). She has long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a rich chocolate waterfall. Her eyes are an piercing green, a shade that seems almost otherworldly in its intensity. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone, as if she spends a lot of time outdoors.

**Personality:**
Camilla is a introspective and emotional person who wears her heart on her sleeve. She's deeply connected to her past and her roots, which makes her feel a sense of belonging and nostalgia. At the same time, she's independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance that comes from being raised by an estranged aunt in the city. This dual nature of her personality often leaves her feeling torn between two worlds - the old one she left behind and the new life she's built.

**Interests:**
Camilla is a romantic at heart, with a deep love for memories, nostalgia, and the past. She's fascinated by history, architecture, and the stories that these structures hold within them. Her return to her hometown has awakened a sense of curiosity in her about the town's rich history and the people who lived there before. She's also interested in photography, often taking pictures of the places she visits as a way to document and preserve memories.

**Additional Quirks:**
Camilla has a habit of carrying a small notebook with her wherever she goes, where she writes down quotes, lyrics, or lines from books that resonate with her. This habit dates back to her childhood when she used to scribble notes in the margins of her favorite books. When she's alone, she often gets lost in daydreams about her past and what could have been.
