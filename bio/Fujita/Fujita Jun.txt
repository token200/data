Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Fujita Jun's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Fujita Jun is portrayed as a highly skilled and dedicated samurai with unwavering loyalty and honor. He is depicted as a calculated and precise warrior who values discipline, strategy, and the art of war. His commitment to his principles is unshakeable, which led him to defect from the Ashikaga clan and join forces with the Takeda clan during a time of civil war in Japan.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Fujita Jun stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, suggesting he is above average height for his time period.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on traditional Japanese depictions of samurai, it's likely that he has piercing brown or dark brown eyes.

**Interests:** Fujita Jun's interests seem to revolve around his martial arts training and the art of war. As a member of the Ashikaga clan, he would have been trained in traditional Japanese martial arts such as kenjutsu (the art of sword fighting) and jujutsu (grappling). His interest in honor and loyalty suggests that he is deeply committed to his values and will go to great lengths to uphold them.

Additionally, Fujita Jun's experience training under the wisest ronin masters in Kyoto implies that he has a strong appreciation for strategy and discipline. It can be inferred that he also values tradition and heritage, as he has remained loyal to his clan despite its waning power during the civil war.

It's worth noting that some aspects of Fujita Jun's personality and interests may be inferred or alluded to through the story rather than being explicitly stated.
