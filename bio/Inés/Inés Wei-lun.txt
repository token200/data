**Physical Attributes:**

**Personality:**
Inés is a brilliant astrophysicist with a reclusive personality. She is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe and its mysteries. Her relentless pursuit of knowledge has come at a cost, however – she has sacrificed relationships, social connections, and even a sense of belonging in her previous life. In Ashwood, she begins to rediscover herself and find meaning in the stars that once guided her. She is drawn to the tranquility and simplicity of small-town life, which contrasts sharply with the fast-paced urban environment she left behind.

Her interest lies in unraveling the secrets of the cosmos, particularly when it comes to understanding unusual star systems that defy explanation. She finds solace in her work and becomes fixated on deciphering an old friend's cryptic message about a mysterious star system. This obsession leads her to conduct late-night experiments and pour over dusty texts in search of answers.

Inés is also drawn to the quiet, contemplative life of Ashwood, where she can observe the night sky without distractions. She finds meaning and belonging among the townspeople, who welcome her with open arms not just for her scientific achievements but also for her unique perspective on the world.

As Inés settles into her new life in Ashwood, it becomes clear that she is driven by a desire to reconnect with her own sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe.
