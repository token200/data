**Personality:** Inés appears to be a introspective and emotional individual with a strong connection to her heritage and personal history. She has experienced grief and loss but finds solace in nature and the stories that have been passed down through her family. Her ability to listen closely and hear whispers of the past suggests she is empathetic and sensitive.

**Physical Attributes:** Inés's physical attributes are not fully described in the short story, so I will make some assumptions based on the context:

* **Height:** Around 5'6" (168 cm) - This height would allow her to walk along the shoreline comfortably and feel a sense of connection to the ocean.
* **Eye Color:** Dark brown or hazel - The description of her abuela's eyes as "as dark as the sea itself" suggests that Inés may have inherited this characteristic, with a deep brown or hazel eye color that evokes the mystery of the ocean.
* **Hair Color and Style:** Long, dark hair that falls down her back like the waves themselves - This would complement her connection to the ocean and add to her introspective nature.
* **Build:** Slender yet athletic build - Inés's activity of walking along the shoreline and feeling a sense of rhythm with the sea suggests she has a fit and agile physique.

**Interests:** Based on the context, it appears that Inés is deeply interested in:

* **Heritage and Family History**: She values her abuela's stories and feels a strong connection to her family's past.
* **Nature and the Ocean**: The story highlights her sense of comfort and solace when spending time by the ocean. She seems to find inspiration and guidance in its rhythms and beauty.
