**Personality:** Inés Salamanca is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides her vulnerabilities. She possesses sharp wit and quick tongue, which suggests she's intelligent, strategic, and confident. Her years of growing up under the weight of her family's legacy have likely taught her to be resourceful, adaptable, and fiercely independent. However, her trust issues and tendency to rely on instinct suggest a deeper emotional scar that may be difficult to overcome.

**Physical Attributes:** Inés Salamanca is described as having razor-sharp instincts, which could imply she's highly analytical and observant.

However, based on the context of the story, it's possible to make an educated guess about Inés Salamanca's physical appearance. As a highly trained and experienced operative, she may be in her mid-to-late 30s, with a lean, athletic build that reflects her years of martial arts training and espionage work. Her piercing green eyes would likely be framed by dark, expressive eyebrows and a sharp jawline, giving her an intense, intelligent appearance.

She is deeply invested in uncovering the truth about her father's operations and the mysterious "Eclipse" project. Her strong sense of duty and loyalty to her agency drive her to take risks and push boundaries in pursuit of information.

Outside of her professional life, Inés Salamanca may have a more introspective side, driven by her complex personality and emotional scars. She may be drawn to intellectual pursuits, such as reading, strategy games, or philosophical debates, which could provide her with an outlet for her analytical mind.

Overall, Inés Salamanca is a multifaceted character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are deeply intertwined with her work in the world of espionage.
