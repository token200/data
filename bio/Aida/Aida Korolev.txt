**Personality:** Aida Korolev is a complex and multi-faceted individual. As a skilled operative for The Watchers, she exudes confidence and a sense of self-assurance that allows her to navigate high-stakes situations with ease. Her experience as a lone wolf has honed her independence, making her a formidable force in the shadows. However, this also implies a certain emotional distance, which may make it difficult for her to form close relationships or trust others easily.

Despite this tough exterior, Aida has a deep sense of compassion and empathy, evident in her willingness to risk her own life to protect innocent civilians like Echo. Her determination to unravel the mysteries surrounding Echo's situation suggests that she is driven by a strong moral compass and a desire for justice.

Her hair is a dark brown color, often styled in a practical, low-maintenance manner that allows her to move freely without distractions.

Her eyes are an striking feature – piercing blue, almost icy in intensity, which can be unnerving for those who encounter them. This captivating gaze seems to bore into the soul of those she interacts with, as if daring them to reveal their secrets or intentions.

**Interests:** Aida's interests are closely tied to her work as a Watcher operative. She is fascinated by the cutting edge of technology and innovation, often seeking out advanced training programs that push her skills to the limit.

Her experience working in the shadows has also given her a unique perspective on human psychology and behavior, making her an expert observer of human emotions and motivations. This expertise allows her to identify potential threats or warning signs, such as those exhibited by Echo during their encounter.

Beyond her professional interests, Aida seems to be drawn to enigmatic figures like Echo – individuals whose presence challenges her perceptions and forces her to confront the unknown. Her quest for knowledge and understanding drives her forward, often taking her down dark and unexpected paths that test her limits as an operative.
