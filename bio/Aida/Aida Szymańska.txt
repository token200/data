**Personality:** Aida appears to be a deeply empathetic and creative individual. Her passion for photography is not only driven by technical skill but also by a genuine desire to understand and connect with people on an emotional level. She seems to possess a sensitive soul, as evidenced by her reaction to the melancholic tune played by the young musician in Krakow – tears welled up in her eyes upon reviewing the photo. This sensitivity likely makes her an approachable and compassionate person.
