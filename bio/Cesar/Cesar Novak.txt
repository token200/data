His dark brown hair is often disheveled, adding to his slightly rumpled appearance.

**Personality:**
Cesar Novak's sharp mind and quick wit have earned him a reputation as a brilliant scientist with an insatiable curiosity.

Despite this, Cesar has a dry sense of humor that surfaces occasionally, revealing a more vulnerable side beneath his tough exterior.

**Interests:**
Cesar Novak's interests are centered around unraveling the mysteries of the universe, particularly those related to space and time. His love for ancient texts and cryptic messages has led him down a rabbit hole of obsession, as he seeks to unlock the secrets hidden within the fabric of reality. When not researching or experimenting in his laboratory, Cesar can be found pouring over dusty tomes in libraries, seeking out new clues to guide his research.

**Habits:**
Cesar's coffee-fueled workaholic tendencies have made him prone to late-night study sessions and marathon experiments.
