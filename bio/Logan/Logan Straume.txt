Here is a summary of Logan Straume's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Logan is a complex and driven individual. On the surface, he appears rugged and rough-around-the-edges, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep sense of justice and a commitment to uncovering the truth. He has been burned by corruption and betrayal in the past, which has made him cautious and guarded, especially around strangers. However, when he meets someone who shares his values and determination, he opens up and becomes fiercely loyal and protective. Logan is also haunted by grief and anger, fueled by the loss of his brother Marcus, but this emotion drives him to keep pushing forward in pursuit of justice.

**Physical Attributes:** Logan stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, which suggests a disciplined lifestyle. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing his angular face and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a past confrontation, and his skin bears the marks of a life spent on the streets.

**Interests:** Logan's interests are closely tied to his pursuit of justice and truth. He is passionate about exposing corruption and taking down those who abuse power. Outside of his work as a "consultant," he enjoys hiking, running, and reading, particularly history books and biographies of famous activists and whistleblowers. Music is also an important part of Logan's life; he has a fondness for classic rock and folk music that echoes the rebellious spirit of Elvis Presley, whose coffee shop namesake seems to have resonated with him.

These interests reflect Logan's values and goals: to uncover the truth, stand up for what is right, and protect those who cannot defend themselves.
