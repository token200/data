**Personality:** Logan Esposito appears to be a tough and stoic individual with a strong sense of justice. He is driven by a desire to help those in need, particularly those who have been wronged or abandoned by the system. Despite his gruff exterior, he has a soft spot for vulnerable individuals like Sarah and her sister Emily. Logan's experience and expertise as a private investigator make him resourceful and determined, but also suggest that he may be prone to walking into danger without hesitation.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the text, we can infer that Logan Esposito is likely:

* Tall (he is able to see over the top of a stack of files on his desk)
* Male (the story refers to him using masculine pronouns and describes him as "a man")
* Possibly in his 40s or 50s (his experience and expertise suggest that he has some years under his belt)
* Has piercing brown eyes (despite the dim lighting in his office, Logan's eyes are able to focus on Sarah as she enters)

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Logan Esposito is clearly drawn to cases involving mystery, deception, and the pursuit of truth. He is also interested in the human aspect of these cases, particularly when it comes to understanding the motivations and emotions of those involved (e.g., Sarah's desperation to find her sister). His willingness to take on difficult cases and put himself in harm's way suggests that he values justice and is willing to push boundaries to achieve it.
