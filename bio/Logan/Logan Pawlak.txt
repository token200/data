Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Logan Pawlak:

**Personality:** Logan Pawlak is a driven and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. As a former detective, he has seen the worst of humanity's darker side, but his experiences have only strengthened his resolve to uncover the truth and bring closure to those affected by crime. He is fiercely independent and intensely focused on solving cases, often to the point of obsession. Despite this, Logan seems to possess a deep sense of empathy for those who have been victimized, particularly his late partner Rachel, whose case he has dedicated himself to solving.

**Physical Attributes:** Logan Pawlak stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he interrogates. His dark hair is often unkempt and flecked with gray, hinting at the weight of his responsibilities. He has a rugged, weathered complexion from years spent working outdoors and in dimly lit environments.

**Interests:** Logan's primary interest is in solving crimes and bringing justice to victims and their families. Outside of work, he appears to have few interests or hobbies, but it can be inferred that he values solitude and quiet contemplation as a way to recharge and refocus. His determination and single-minded focus on his cases suggest that he may also be interested in martial arts or self-defense training to help him stay physically fit and prepared for the challenges ahead.

It's worth noting that these details were not explicitly mentioned in the original short story, but rather inferred from the context and Logan's character.
