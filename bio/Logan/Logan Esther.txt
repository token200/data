**Personality:**

Logan is an introverted and intensely focused individual. She is driven by a curiosity about the world and a passion for uncovering hidden truths. Her reclusive nature allows her to focus on her work without distraction, but it also makes her wary of getting close to others or sharing her personal life.

As a member of "Zero Cool," Logan has developed a reputation as a brilliant and feared hacker, which has made her both admired and respected by her peers. However, this reputation comes with a price - she is often underestimated or seen as an untrustworthy outsider.

Despite her tough exterior, Logan has a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity, particularly when it comes to the consequences of her actions. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, always seeking to challenge authority and push boundaries.

* Conspiracy theories: Logan has a fascination with alternative explanations for historical events and current global politics.
* Reading and research: In her rare moments of downtime, she devours books on cryptography, coding theory, and philosophy.
* Music: Logan has a fondness for electronic music, particularly artists who push the boundaries of sound and style.

**Additional Quirks:**

* Logan's workspace is cluttered with post-it notes, empty energy drink cans, and scraps of paper containing cryptic notes and theories.
* She has a habit of speaking in cryptic code to her colleagues within "Zero Cool," using a combination of slang and technical jargon to convey complex ideas.
* Despite her tough exterior, Logan has a secret love of sentimental trinkets and mementos from her past - she keeps them hidden away in a locked box, only accessing them when she needs a reminder of her personal life.
