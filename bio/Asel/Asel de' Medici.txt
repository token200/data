He yearns for independence and self-expression, often finding solace in art and music. Despite his privileged upbringing, Asel is not spoiled or arrogant; instead, he is kind, thoughtful, and deeply emotional.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Hair Color: Jet black
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a hint of golden undertones

**Interests:** Asel is deeply passionate about music, particularly the flute. He finds solace in its haunting melody and beauty. He also has a great admiration for Petrarch's poetry, which resonates with his own experiences of hardship and heartache. Music becomes an extension of himself, allowing him to express emotions he cannot verbalize.
