Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Valentin Wozniak:

**Physical Attributes:**
Valentin "Val" Wozniak stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy, piecey manner. His piercing blue eyes are his most striking feature, which can sometimes appear brooding or intense when he's focused on something or someone. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a past encounter that has become a part of his rugged charm.

**Personality:**
Val is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he appears confident, charismatic, and calculating, which are all traits honed from years of living on the fringes of society as a con artist. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply vulnerable person who has been shaped by his tumultuous childhood and experiences in prison. Val is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging societal norms and expectations. He has a strong sense of self-preservation and can be guarded with those he trusts, but when he opens up, he reveals a sensitive and creative soul.

**Interests:**
Val's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his past experiences and current passions:

* Art: Val finds solace in drawing, painting, and sculpting, which allows him to express himself creatively without needing to rely on deception or manipulation.
* Music: He has always been fascinated by music, particularly jazz and blues, and enjoys playing the guitar in his free time. Sophia introduces him to her favorite artist, a local singer-songwriter who inspires Val's creative side.
* Writing: As he begins to rebuild his life, Val starts writing short stories and poetry as a way to process his thoughts and emotions.
* Food: Val develops a love for cooking and experimenting with new flavors, particularly after working at the local café. He becomes an apprentice to a master chef who teaches him the art of traditional cuisine.

These interests reflect Val's growing desire to rediscover himself outside of his former life as a con artist and thief.
