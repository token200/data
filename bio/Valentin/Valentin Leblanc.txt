Here's a summary of Valentin Leblanc's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Valentin is an enigmatic and charismatic individual with a complex past. Despite his rough reputation as a thief and pickpocket known as "Le Fantôme", he has a soft spot for kindness and empathy. He is intensely curious and drawn to people who understand him on a deep level, such as Aurélie Dumont. Valentin's dry wit and sarcasm are evident in his interactions with others, but beneath this exterior lies a sensitive and vulnerable individual.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - lean and athletic build
* Eye Color: Unsettling shade of green (almost iridescent)
* Hair: Always slicked back, revealing a face that seems chiseled from granite
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned complexion with hints of Mediterranean heritage

**Interests:** Valentin has a deep appreciation for the city of Montreal and its hidden corners. He enjoys navigating its narrow alleys and market stalls, where he can blend into the shadows and observe human behavior. As an art lover, he is fascinated by Aurélie's paintings, which seem to capture the essence of the city's spirit. His interests also extend to music, particularly jazz and French cabaret, which he finds soulful and expressive. When not exploring the city or honing his thieving skills, Valentin enjoys listening to the sounds of Montreal's underground art scene, where creativity and innovation thrive.

Valentin's connection with Aurélie has also sparked a new interest in him - learning more about his own history and identity, and understanding why he is drawn to people who seem to "see" him on a fundamental level. This sense of self-discovery may lead him down uncharted paths, as he begins to question the mysteries surrounding his past and explore new avenues for connection and meaning.
