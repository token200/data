Here is a summary of Valentin González's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Valentin González is enigmatic and mysterious. He appears to be driven by a sense of duty or obligation, as hinted at by his connection to the Picasso painting and the memories of his late brother. This emotional depth suggests that there may be more to him than just a master thief. His ability to manipulate people around him with ease implies that he is charismatic and confident.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green, which seems to hold intensity and sincerity in his gaze.
* Facial Features: No description of his face or facial features are provided, but the fact that he wears a mask implies that he may have facial scars or markings.

**Interests:** Art is a significant interest for Valentin González. As an art enthusiast himself (before becoming a thief), he has a deep appreciation for masterpieces like Picasso's rare painting. His personal connection to the artwork and memories of his late brother suggest that art holds emotional significance for him.

In addition to art, it appears that Valentin values solitude and anonymity. His ability to blend into crowds and manipulate people around him implies that he is comfortable with being alone and may prefer it. This sense of solitude may have driven his decision to become a master thief in the first place, allowing him to maintain control over his life.

The older woman's photograph of Valentin as a young man suggests that there was another aspect of his personality - one that shone through when he was not behind his mask. Her eyes sparkling with nostalgia and memories of their bond implies that there may be more to Valentin than just his mysterious persona.
