Valentin stands at 6'1" with a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of fighting on the streets. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. Dark hair is flecked with subtle grays, hinting at his age and experiences. A sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones give him a chiseled appearance that commands respect.

Despite this, Valentin has a strong sense of loyalty and duty, particularly towards those he cares about. He is fiercely protective of his loved ones and will stop at nothing to defend them. This trait often puts him at odds with The Order's more ruthless operatives, who prioritize power over human life.

In addition to combat sports, Valentin is fascinated by strategy and tactics, often analyzing The Order's moves to anticipate their next steps. This analytical mind serves him well in his role as a lieutenant, allowing him to outmaneuver opponents and stay one step ahead of his enemies.

Valentin's interests also extend to philosophy and spirituality, particularly the teachings of The Archon, who has become a mentor and spiritual guide for him. Valentin is drawn to the idea of personal growth and self-discovery, seeking to understand the true nature of power and control in his own life.
