Here's a summary of Valentin Volkov's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Valentin is a pragmatic and calculating individual who sees opportunities where others might see threats. He is likely a master strategist with a no-nonsense approach to politics and intrigue. As a high-ranking official in the KGB, he has developed a sense of loyalty only to those who can be trusted, and even then, it's a conditional one. Despite his tough exterior, there is a hint of sincerity in his interactions with others, particularly when it comes to showing appreciation for help or service.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - tall enough to command respect, but not so imposing as to be intimidating.
* Eye Color: Dark brown or espresso-colored eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, adding to his aura of authority and intensity.
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a background in martial arts or physical fitness.
* Hair: Possibly dark hair that's neatly styled, reflecting his Soviet Union upbringing.

**Interests:** As a high-ranking official in the KGB, Valentin is likely deeply invested in:
	+ Politics and power struggles within the Soviet Union
	+ Intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence operations
	+ Strategic planning and execution of covert missions
	+ The art of manipulation and psychological warfare

Outside of his work with the KGB, it's unclear what Valentin's personal interests or hobbies might be. However, given his character in the story, it's possible that he enjoys:
	+ Reading (perhaps espionage novels or literature on politics and history)
	+ Cigars (smoking is mentioned in the story as a habit of his)
	+ High-stakes games like chess or poker
	+ Traveling and exploring new places, perhaps with an eye for security vulnerabilities

Keep in mind that these are speculative details based on the short story, and Valentin's true personality, interests, and physical attributes might be different.
