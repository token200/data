**Physical Attributes:**
Valentin Girace is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, with a tall and lean build. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) and has piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His hair is dark and always perfectly styled, adding to his charismatic persona.

**Personality:**
Valentin Girace is a man of mystery and intrigue, with an air of seduction surrounding him. He exudes confidence and charm, making it difficult for others to discern his true intentions. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be ruthless when the situation calls for it. Valentin is intelligent and cunning, always thinking several steps ahead of those around him.

**Interests:**
Valentin's primary interest lies in completing his missions with precision and efficiency.
