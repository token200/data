Here is a summary of Valentin Moln√°r's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Valentin is a determined and driven individual with a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely intelligent and has a keen analytical mind, which serves him well in his work as a detective. However, this intensity can also make him come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. As he delves deeper into the case that connects to his family's dark history, he becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth, putting a strain on his personal relationships and well-being.

**Physical Attributes:** Valentin is of average height, around 5'10" (178 cm), with a lean and athletic build. His eye color is an intense brown that seems to bore into those he meets. He has short, dark hair and a sharp jawline, giving him a strong and angular appearance. Despite his rugged demeanor, there are hints of vulnerability in his eyes, which suggest a deep-seated emotional complexity.

**Interests:** Valentin is deeply passionate about justice and uncovering the truth, particularly when it comes to cases involving corruption and deception. He has a particular interest in unraveling the web of deceit that underlies Budapest's elite and is driven by a desire to see those who have escaped accountability brought to justice. Outside of his work as a detective, Valentin seems to be a private person with few hobbies or interests beyond his cases. However, this could be due to the intense focus he brings to his work, leaving little room for personal pursuits.

It is also worth noting that Valentin's investigation into his father's murder and the larger money laundering operation has awakened some repressed emotions and memories from his childhood. He seems to have a deep-seated need to understand the truth about his family's past and the events surrounding his father's death, which will likely continue to drive his actions throughout the story.
