Based on the inspiration from the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Úrsula "Rory" Walker:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Weight: 130 lbs (59 kg)
* Hair Color: Wild curly brown hair that falls down her back like a cascade of autumn leaves
* Eye Color: Bright green eyes with a hint of golden sparkle, reminiscent of moss-covered stones in the woods
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a subtle scattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks

**Personality:**

Rory is an intrepid and adventurous soul with a passion for discovery. Her infectious enthusiasm draws people to her shop, "Curios and Antiques," where she reigns as the guardian of hidden treasures and forgotten histories. With an unyielding curiosity and determination, Rory delves into every nook and cranny, determined to unravel the secrets of Willow Creek's mysterious past.

Rory is fiercely independent and values her alone time above all else. She's not afraid to get her hands dirty or take risks when uncovering a new discovery. Her love for antiques and curios has become an integral part of who she is, connecting her to her town and its rich history.

**Interests:**

* Collecting rare books, particularly ancient tomes bound in worn leather
* Scouring flea markets, estate sales, and antique shops for hidden treasures and artifacts
* Deciphering codes and symbols etched into historical texts
* Researching local legends and myths surrounding Willow Creek's history
* Studying astronomy and astrology, often lost in the night sky
* Playing her vintage guitar to accompany her favorite folk songs

**Quirks:**

Rory has a habit of carrying a worn leather journal with her wherever she goes, jotting down notes and observations about every discovery. She's also known for her fascination with antique door knockers, which she claims have an uncanny ability to sense when someone is hiding something.

This profile captures the essence of Úrsula "Rory" Walker, a curious and determined individual who weaves the threads of history into her very being.
