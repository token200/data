Here's a summary of Úrsula Romanova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Úrsula Romanova is a master manipulator with a razor-sharp wit and sharp tongue. She exudes confidence and commands attention without trying to. Her piercing gaze seems to bore into those she meets, sizing them up for potential exploitation. Despite her intimidating reputation, she has a sly sense of humor and can be charming when it suits her.

**Physical Attributes:** Úrsula Romanova stands at 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet lithe build. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green that seem to see right through those she meets. Her dark hair is often styled in a sleek, low bun, framing her heart-shaped face and accentuating her sharp jawline.

**Interests:** Úrsula Romanova's interests lie in manipulating others for her own gain. She has no qualms about using people to further her own goals or exploiting those who are vulnerable. Despite this, she seems to have a fascination with the underworld of New Haven, where thieves and con artists gather. She may be drawn to these individuals because they share her cunning nature, or perhaps she sees something in them that reminds her of herself.

It's worth noting that Úrsula Romanova appears to be someone who values power and control above all else. Her reputation as a ruthless killer is whispered about in fear by those in the underworld, suggesting that she will stop at nothing to get what she wants. However, her interaction with Joe, the bartender, suggests that she may not be entirely devoid of empathy or respect for others – at least, when it suits her purposes.
