Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Úrsula Kozłowski:

**Personality:** Úrsula is a reserved and introspective individual who prefers to keep to herself. She values her independence and likes to maintain a low profile, which is reflected in her choice of occupation and living situation on the outskirts of town. Despite her shy demeanor, she has a dry sense of humor and can come across as wryly sarcastic at times. However, once you gain her trust, Úrsula reveals a deep passion for alchemy and a strong commitment to sharing her knowledge with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Úrsula is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, but her exact age is unknown due to her preference for secrecy. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which is slightly above average height. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, a trait that has led some to speculate about her mystical connections. Her hair is dark brown and often tied back in a practical bun, allowing her focus on her work.

**Interests:** Úrsula's primary interest is alchemy, which she practices with dedication and expertise. She finds solace in the transformative power of alchemical processes and enjoys experimenting with new recipes and techniques. Beyond her work, Úrsula seems to have little time for socializing or other hobbies. However, as revealed through her interactions with Emily, she does appreciate a good cup of tea, which suggests that she may have a softer side.

It's worth noting that the short story only touches on Úrsula's personality and interests in passing, leaving much to be inferred about her background and motivations.
