However, beneath this tough exterior lies a deep sadness and longing for peace that she has been unable to shake off. She is driven by a desire for justice and closure, which stems from the tragic events of her past.

**Physical Attributes:** Tsai Emi is described as an old woman with long black hair flowing behind her like a dark cloud when standing in the forest. Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she meets, striking fear and curiosity at the same time. There is no mention of her height, but based on the description of her as an "old woman," it can be inferred that she may be slightly elderly or middle-aged.

**Interests:** Tsai Emi's interests are largely centered around seeking revenge against those responsible for her family's deaths and uncovering the truth about the bandit attack. However, as she spends more time with Kaito, it becomes clear that she also longs for connection, understanding, and peace.
