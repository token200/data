Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Tsai Woźniak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Tsai is portrayed as a recluse and a master of the obscure. He is depicted as a curmudgeon, but with a secret passion for music and poetry that makes him more endearing to those who get to know him. Despite his reserved nature, he has a deep love for learning and sharing knowledge with others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Tsai appears to be slightly below average height, as he is described as being in the "small" town of Gdańsk.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly stated, but based on his Slavic heritage (he is from Poland), it's likely that he has blue or green eyes.

**Interests:** Tsai's interests are largely centered around obscure knowledge and forgotten languages. He spends years tracking down rare texts and manuscripts to study them in his cramped library. However, as revealed through his interactions with Ewa, he also has a deep love for music and poetry, particularly playing the piano and reciting verse at night.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Tsai has a fondness for pipe tobacco, which is mentioned in passing but suggests a more nuanced side to his character.
