Here's a summary of Aet Hiroki's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aet is an introspective and enigmatic individual with a troubled past. He has been shaped by his experiences of rejection and abandonment, which have made him wary of forming close relationships or attachments. However, when he meets Emiko, he is drawn to her fierce determination and sense of justice, and this sparks a newfound sense of purpose and belonging in him.

**Physical Attributes:** Aet stands at around 6'1" with an athletic build, honed from years of wandering and exploring the wilderness. His dark hair is unkempt and often blown back by the wind, revealing piercing green eyes that seem to hold a deep sadness. He has a small tattoo of a crescent moon on his left cheekbone, which he obtained during one of his travels.

**Interests:** Aet's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his wandering lifestyle. He is an avid observer of human nature, often studying people from afar before making contact. He is also drawn to the mysteries of the world, particularly those related to mythology and folklore. On a more practical level, he is skilled in survival techniques, such as tracking, foraging, and wilderness first aid.

It's worth noting that Aet has a strong sense of justice, particularly when it comes to those who have been wronged or marginalized by power or circumstance. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and convention in his pursuit of truth and understanding. Despite his rough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is willing to risk everything to help others, as evidenced by his unexpected friendship with Emiko.
