Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Aet Eriksson:

**Personality:** Aet Eriksson is a quiet and introspective individual with a strong sense of solitude. He values his independence and finds solace in the rhythms of the sea. Despite his rugged exterior, he has a romantic heart and is deeply moved by the beauty of nature. As he falls in love with Eir, he becomes more open and affectionate, revealing a softer side to those around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Aet Eriksson stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a ruggedly weathered complexion from years of working outdoors. His eyes are a deep blue, a trait inherited from his father, which seems almost grey after spending countless hours scanning the sea for signs of life. His dark brown hair is flecked with threads of silver, a sign of his age and wisdom. Aet's hands, however, tell the story of his years spent hauling nets and lifting heavy loads â€“ they are rough and calloused.

**Interests:** Aet Eriksson has always been deeply connected to the sea and its rhythms. He finds joy in watching the sailboats glide across the fjord, listening to the sound of the waves, and feeling the wind in his hair. As an artist at heart (albeit one who doesn't fully realize it himself), he finds inspiration in the wild beauty of the landscape. He loves to sit on the rocks with Eir, watching the sun set over the water, and feeling a deep sense of peace and contentment.

As his relationship with Eir grows stronger, Aet becomes more interested in exploring the artistic side of himself, helping her build a life that blends the rhythms of the sea with the beauty of art.
