Here is a summary of Aet Sánchez-Gijón's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Aet stands at 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown and falls in loose waves down her back, often hidden under a fringe that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an intense, piercing green that seem to bore into those she meets. A small scar above her left eyebrow hints at a childhood injury, but it only adds to her enigmatic allure.

**Personality:**
Aet is a complex and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. Growing up in a tumultuous household has made her fiercely independent and self-reliant, often leading her to push people away in an effort to protect herself from getting hurt again. Despite this tough exterior, she has a deep well of emotional vulnerability that she only reveals through her art. Aet is intensely private and guarded, but when she allows herself to be vulnerable with others, she can come across as surprisingly warm and empathetic.

**Interests:**
Aet's passion for art knows no bounds. She is obsessed with capturing the inner lives of those around her on canvas, often using bold colors and expressive brushstrokes to convey the intensity of human emotion. Outside of her studio, Aet enjoys reading poetry, listening to classical music, and practicing yoga to clear her mind. She has a weakness for old books, antique furniture, and second-hand art supplies, which she collects with great enthusiasm.

In terms of interests beyond art, Aet is drawn to the mysteries of the universe, particularly in relation to human psychology and behavior. She finds solace in philosophy, existentialism, and psychoanalysis, often incorporating themes from these subjects into her artwork.
