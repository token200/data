He is also strategic thinker, always looking for ways to expand the empire's borders and increase its wealth.

**Physical Attributes:** Aetius stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, with a lean yet athletic build. His piercing eyes are a deep shade of blue, a trait inherited from his Germanicus ancestors. His dark brown hair is always neatly trimmed, and he sports a well-groomed beard that accentuates his sharp jawline.
