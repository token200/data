Here's a summary of the fictional character Audrey Muller:

**Physical Attributes:**
Audrey is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with a slender yet athletic build. Her curly brown hair falls down her back like a wild mane, and her bright green eyes sparkle like sea glass, giving away her free-spirited nature. She has a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose, adding to her whimsical charm.

**Personality:**
Audrey is a creative and adventurous individual with a passion for art, literature, and the ocean. She's a hopeless romantic at heart, often finding herself lost in thought as she gazes out at the ever-changing tides. Despite her carefree exterior, Audrey has struggled to find stability in her personal life, leading to a pattern of fleeting relationships. However, with Max by her side, she begins to see the world in a new light and discovers a sense of belonging.

**Interests:**
Audrey's interests revolve around art, literature, and the ocean. She spends most of her days lost in thought, inspired by the tides and the stories they tell. Her studio apartment is a reflection of this passion, cluttered with half-finished canvases, paint-stained rags, and shells collected from her daily walks along the shore. She's also an avid reader and writer, often pouring her heart onto paper as she navigates the ups and downs of life.

**Goals:**
As Audrey finds stability in her personal life with Max, she begins to envision a future where art and love merge in perfect harmony. She dreams of building a studio space that reflects her unique perspective on the world, filled with vibrant landscapes and seascapes that capture the essence of the ocean's moods. With Max by her side, Audrey is eager to explore the world together, sharing their passions and fears under the starry night sky.
