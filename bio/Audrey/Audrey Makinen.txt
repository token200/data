**Personality:** Audrey is a creative and introspective person who values connection with others and nature. She has a sense of restlessness and yearning for something more, which stems from her time in the competitive art school environment. Despite this, she is determined to prove herself and find her place in the world.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6"
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair: Short, spiky, and dyed a vibrant shade of purple (temporary dye that changes seasonally)
* Style: Audrey's fashion sense is eclectic and expressive, often incorporating bold colors and statement pieces. She favors comfortable clothing that allows her to move freely.

**Interests:** Audrey is passionate about art, particularly painting and mixed media. She enjoys experimenting with different techniques and materials to create unique pieces that reflect her emotions and experiences. Other interests include spending time in nature, practicing yoga, and listening to indie folk music.

It's worth noting that Audrey has a bit of a dichotomy between her love for art school's creative energy and her desire for peace and connection in nature.
