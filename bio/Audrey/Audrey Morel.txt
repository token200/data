Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Audrey Morel:

**Personality:** Audrey Morel appears to be introspective and emotionally complex. She has a deep sense of self-awareness and recognizes that she's been running from her own identity for years. She's drawn to reconnecting with her past and piecing together fragments of her own identity, suggesting that she values authenticity and personal growth.

**Physical Attributes:** Audrey is likely to be in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. Her height is not specified, but given the small-town setting, it's possible she's relatively petite. Her eye color is brown, which complements her likely dark hair (the story doesn't specify her hair color, but it's implied to be a rich, dark shade). Her facial features are not explicitly described, but her introspective nature suggests that she may have a more reserved or thoughtful expression.

**Interests:** Audrey seems to be drawn to the natural world, with a particular fondness for exploring the woods and listening to the sounds of nature. She also values nostalgia and history, as evident in her desire to reconnect with old haunts and revisit places from her childhood. Her interest in storytelling is also apparent, as she listens to her father's stories by the fireplace and later unravels fragments of her own past through her memories.

Overall, Audrey appears to be a thoughtful and introspective individual who values authenticity, personal growth, and connection with nature and her own history.
