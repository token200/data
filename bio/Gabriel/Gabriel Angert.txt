Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Gabriel Angert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

He has a melancholic nature, which fuels his creativity and drives him to express himself through his compositions. Despite his talent and success, he struggles with personal demons, particularly the loss of his sister to cancer, which continues to haunt him. However, meeting Lena sparks a sense of hope and connection, indicating that Gabriel is open to exploring new relationships and experiences.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the original story, so I'll create some:

**Interests:**

* Music: Gabriel's love for music is evident throughout the story. He is a skilled pianist and composer who draws inspiration from classical elegance to modern experimentation.
* Classical music: As a child, he was introduced to Chopin's nocturnes by his parents, which set him on a path of musical exploration and appreciation.
