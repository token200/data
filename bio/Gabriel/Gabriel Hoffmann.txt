**Personality:** Gabriel is an introspective and creative individual who struggles with feeling trapped by his current life path. He is sensitive to criticism and expectations from others, particularly his parents, which has led to a sense of suffocation. However, he also possesses a spark of determination and a longing for freedom and self-expression.

**Physical Attributes:** Gabriel's physical attributes are not extensively described in the short story, but based on the context, we can infer some details:

* **Height:** Gabriel is likely a slender or average-built individual, as his artistic pursuits seem to require mobility and flexibility.
* **Eye Color:** His eye color is not specified, but based on his personality, he might have expressive brown eyes that convey his emotional state.
* **Other Physical Attributes:** Gabriel's appearance in the story is described as someone who sits "blankly" at his desk, which suggests he may be somewhat disheveled or preoccupied with his work. However, when interacting with Maria, he seems more relaxed and engaged.

**Interests:** Gabriel has a strong passion for art, particularly painting. As a young child, he was drawn to the performing arts, but his parents' expectations led him away from this path.
