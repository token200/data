**Personality:**

Gabriel is an enigmatic and introspective person, hiding beneath the surface of her glamorous ballerina persona. She is fiercely dedicated to her craft, but also intensely private and guarded. Her strong willpower and determination have driven her to achieve incredible success in the competitive world of ballet, but this has come at a cost to her mental health and personal relationships.

As she navigated the highs and lows of her career, Gabriel developed a dry sense of humor and a tendency to keep people at arm's length. She is fiercely loyal to those she considers friends, but only reveals fragments of herself to those closest to her.

Despite her tough exterior, there is a deep vulnerability and sensitivity beneath Gabriel's toughened skin. Her journey towards self-discovery and redemption has taught her the value of balance and inner peace, allowing her to approach life with a newfound sense of compassion and understanding.

**Interests:**

* Dance (of course!) - although no longer in its most intense, competitive form
* Hiking and exploring Russia's vast wilderness
* Photography - Gabriel is an avid photographer, capturing the beauty of nature and the people she encounters along her journey
* Reading - particularly classical literature and poetry, which speaks to her artistic soul
* Music - Gabriel has a fondness for Russian folk music and traditional ballet scores

Gabriel's love of dance was never just about performance or recognition, but about expressing herself creatively and connecting with something greater than herself. Her journey towards redemption has taught her that there is beauty in slowing down, being present, and finding meaning beyond the spotlight.
