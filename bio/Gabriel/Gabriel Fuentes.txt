Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Gabriel Fuentes' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Gabriel appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. As a private investigator, he has seen his fair share of cases and is not easily intimidated. However, there's an air of introspection about him, as evidenced by his hesitation when discussing his thoughts with Alex. This suggests that he might be someone who weighs options carefully and considers different perspectives.

**Physical Attributes:** Gabriel seems to be a tall individual, but the exact height is not mentioned in the story. His eye color is not specified either, so I'll assume he has dark eyes, perhaps brown or gray, which are common colors for men of Latin American descent (Gabriel's surname is Fuentes). He appears to be lean and agile, as indicated by his ability to move stealthily through the alleyway.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Gabriel's interests likely revolve around solving cases and uncovering hidden truths. He seems to have a keen eye for detail and is not afraid to think outside the box. His interest in "The Architect" suggests that he's drawn to intellectual challenges and is willing to follow leads no matter how tenuous.

Given his background as a private investigator, it's possible that Gabriel has an interest in martial arts or self-defense, which would explain his ability to navigate the alleyway without being detected. However, this is purely speculative, and more information would be needed to confirm this theory.

Overall, Gabriel Fuentes seems like a complex character with a blend of determination, resourcefulness, and analytical thinking. His interests likely revolve around solving puzzles and uncovering hidden truths, which drives his passion for private investigation.
