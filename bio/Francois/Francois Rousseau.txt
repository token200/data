Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Francois Rousseau:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt to reflect his intellectual intensity

**Personality:**

Francois Rousseau is an insatiably curious individual with a passion for discovery that drives him to constantly push the boundaries of human understanding. He possesses a boundless enthusiasm and energy, which fuels his tireless pursuit of knowledge. As an astronomer, he has developed a sense of detachment from material concerns, allowing him to focus solely on unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

Francois is also intensely driven by a desire for recognition and validation, which sometimes leads him to take risks that put himself and others in danger. His competitive nature can make him come across as assertive or even confrontational, but he ultimately strives to achieve greatness through his work.

Despite his intellectual intensity, Francois has a dry sense of humor and enjoys engaging in witty banter with colleagues. He is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends and will go to great lengths to support them in their endeavors.

**Interests:**

* Astronomical research, particularly in the areas of exoplanetary science and stellar dynamics
* Reading classical literature, including works by ancient Greek philosophers and 19th-century French writers
* Collecting rare astronomical texts and manuscripts from his grandfather's library
* Playing the violin as a hobby, often finding solace in music when faced with intellectual challenges

**Background:**

Francois Rousseau was born into a family of modest means but rich intellectual traditions. His grandfather, a retired astronomer himself, instilled in him a love for the night sky and sparked his curiosity about the workings of the universe.

Growing up, Francois spent countless hours poring over his grandfather's old texts, learning about ancient civilizations and the early discoveries of modern astronomy. He pursued his passion with fervor, earning top honors in astronomy from some of the most prestigious universities in Europe.

Now, as a leading expert in his field, Francois is on the cusp of making a groundbreaking discovery that will forever change our understanding of the cosmos.
