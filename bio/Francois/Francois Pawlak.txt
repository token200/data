He is humble and unassuming, always willing to learn from others and take constructive feedback on board. Despite facing numerous rejections and setbacks in his early career, Francois never lost faith in himself or his art. Instead, he uses these experiences as opportunities for growth and refinement.

**Interests:** As a painter, Francois's primary interest is in exploring the world of color and light through his art. He is fascinated by the way different hues can evoke emotions and moods, and spends countless hours researching and experimenting with new techniques to capture this effect on canvas. When not painting, Francois enjoys strolling through the winding streets of Montmartre, people-watching, and sipping coffee at quaint little cafes like the one where he first showcased his work.

Francois is also a romantic at heart, and his love for art is closely tied to his love of history and culture. He spends hours reading about the masters, studying their techniques, and soaking up inspiration from the world around him.
