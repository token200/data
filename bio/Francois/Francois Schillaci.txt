Francois has a dry sense of humor and often uses his wit to deflect attention from himself. He is intensely focused on his work and can become completely absorbed in an investigation, neglecting everything else. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to help them. His background as a spy has taught him many valuable skills, but also left its share of emotional scars - he struggles with intimacy and trust issues, particularly when it comes to his own past.
