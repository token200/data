**Physical Attributes:** Maxim is a young man in his early twenties, standing at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall. He has a lean build and a messy mop of black hair that often falls across his forehead. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with intensity when he's performing on stage. He has a small tattoo of a kanji character for "storm" on his left wrist, which he got as a tribute to the band's name.

**Personality:** Maxim is a creative and passionate individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. As the lead singer of Electric Storm, he is confident and charismatic stage presence, but off-stage, he can be introspective and self-critical at times. He has a strong sense of purpose and conviction, which drives him to create music that reflects his experiences growing up in Tokyo's streets.
