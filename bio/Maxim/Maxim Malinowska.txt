* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a short, messy manner
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a chiseled jawline

**Personality:**

* Maxim is a confident and composed individual, exuding an air of calmness under pressure.
* He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having defected from the Russian special forces unit to pursue his own moral code.
* Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation permits.
* Maxim is deeply committed to justice and will stop at nothing to protect those in need.

**Interests:**

* Hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship (obviously!)
* Firearms training and maintenance

It's worth noting that Maxim's past experience as a member of an elite Russian special forces unit has left him with a certain level of detachment and aloofness. However, once he connects with people and trusts them, he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.
