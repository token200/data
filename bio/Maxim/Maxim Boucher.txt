Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the fictional character Maxim Boucher:

**Physical Attributes:** Maxim stands at an imposing height of 6'2" (188 cm), with chiseled features that suggest a rugged individual. His piercing eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost gray, which seems to hold a thousand secrets and command attention. His dark hair is neatly trimmed, framing his angular face.

**Personality:** Maxim has a tough exterior, often preferring the company of books and whiskey over people. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a soft spot for the vulnerable and downtrodden. He's fiercely independent, having seen the darkest corners of human nature during his years as a detective. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those who need it most.

**Interests:** Maxim is an avid reader, often spending hours devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. He's also an aficionado of fine whiskey, able to appreciate the complex nuances of different varieties. When he's not working, you can find him alone in his dimly lit office, surrounded by stacks of papers, files, and cryptic notes.

It appears that Maxim's interests and personality traits are closely tied to his work as a detective. His fascination with books and whiskey might be a way for him to cope with the darkness he's witnessed during his career. His soft spot for the vulnerable suggests that despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side.

As for additional details, it seems that Maxim is likely in his mid-to-late 40s or early 50s, possibly with a few scars and battle-hardened lines around his eyes from years of dealing with crime. His style seems to be understated yet distinctive, favoring dark suits, crisp white shirts, and black leather jackets that reflect his rugged individualism.
