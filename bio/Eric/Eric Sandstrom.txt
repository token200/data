Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Eric Sandstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eric is a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who values solitude and quiet contemplation. He is driven by an insatiable curiosity and passion for understanding the intricacies of mathematics. Despite his achievements in his field, he has become increasingly isolated due to the pressures of expectation from his peers and the weight of scrutiny from colleagues.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Eric stands at 6'1" (185 cm), with a slender yet athletic build that suggests an active lifestyle despite his reclusive nature.
* Eye Color: His eyes are deep brown, often fixed intently on the equations or formulas in front of him as he ponders and solves problems.

**Interests:** As evident from the story, Eric's primary interest is mathematics, with a focus on complex problem-solving and theoretical advancements. He has a strong background in discovery, having spent his childhood exploring patterns and relationships between numbers in nature. His work is characterized by an unwavering dedication to understanding the intricacies of mathematical concepts.

In addition to mathematics, it appears that Eric values solitude and quiet contemplation, often finding solace in the peaceful surroundings of his study. He also appreciates the simple pleasures in life, such as watching the sunset outside his study window, which brings him a sense of peace and connection to the world around him.

Missing attributes that were inferred from the story include:

* Eric's hair color and style (perhaps brown or sandy-blond, with a slight untidiness that suits his reclusive nature).
* His facial features (perhaps strong cheekbones, piercing eyes, and an angular jawline that give him a sharp, intelligent appearance).
* Any personal relationships or connections he may have made outside of his work (though the story does suggest that his parents were supportive and encouraging).
* His interests beyond mathematics (possibly music, literature, or philosophy, which could complement his analytical mind).
