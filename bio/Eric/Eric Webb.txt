Eric's all-consuming passion for understanding the human mind has led him down a rabbit hole from which there is no return. His increasingly erratic behavior and obsessive focus on Erebus have made him a recluse, feared and respected by those who know him. Yet, it is this very same intensity of purpose that drives him forward, even as he teeters on the edge of the unknown.
