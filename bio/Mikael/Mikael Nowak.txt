Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mikael Nowak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mikael is a skilled and resourceful individual with a no-nonsense attitude. As a former CIA operative turned freelance investigator, he has honed his instincts to detect deception and uncover hidden truths. He is driven by a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to take risks when the situation calls for it. Despite his tough exterior, Mikael has a curious streak and is intrigued by puzzles and mysteries.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Jet black
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, piercing dark eyes, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (possibly from a past mission gone wrong)

**Interests:** Mikael's interests are centered around investigation, surveillance, and intelligence gathering. He is well-versed in hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, and tactical strategy. As an enthusiast of the darker side of human nature, Mikael has a fascination with conspiracy theories, cryptic messages, and encrypted files. His curiosity about Sophia's mysterious message and the artifact at the center of the story suggests that he is driven by a passion for uncovering the truth and unraveling mysteries.

It's worth noting that some attributes, such as his personality, are already implied in the short story, while others, like his interests, can be inferred based on his actions and behavior. The physical attributes I've added to Mikael's profile are based on the description of Sophia and the setting, but may not be explicitly stated in the original text.
