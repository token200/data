His wild mane of curly brown hair is often unruly, framing his heart-shaped face and brightening up his expressive features. His piercing green eyes sparkle with creativity, giving away his artistic nature. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which adds to his endearing, boyish charm.

**Personality:** Mikael Liepiņš is a creative soul with an unquenchable thirst for self-expression. Despite being typecast in his family's bakery as a reliable and skilled baker, he has always yearned for something more – artistry, freedom, and the thrill of bringing new ideas to life. He is introspective and emotional, often wearing his heart on his sleeve when it comes to his passions. This makes him deeply empathetic towards others, but also fiercely individualistic.

He is fascinated by light, color, and texture, which he uses to capture the essence of Latvia's landscapes and culture. When not working on his art, Mikael enjoys wandering through Riga's streets, discovering hidden gems and inspirations. He is also an avid reader of art history and contemporary art journals, always seeking new ideas and techniques to incorporate into his practice.

**Additional Details:** Mikael Liepiņš' height, although not explicitly stated in the original story, was inferred based on the average Latvian adult male height of 5'9" (175 cm). His eye color is a deep, rich green that seems almost otherworldly against his warm, golden-brown skin tone.
