Here's a summary of Mikael Jorgensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mikael Jorgensen is a complex and introspective individual. As the youngest son of a wealthy family, he always felt like an outsider and never quite fit in with his peers. This sense of not belonging drove him to pursue a life of solitude, often getting lost in books. However, when he took over his family's business and uncovered a dark conspiracy, he had to adapt quickly to survive. As a result, Mikael has developed a tough exterior, becoming a skilled and resourceful private investigator. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else.

Despite this, there are hints of vulnerability in his demeanor, particularly when interacting with those closest to him or when faced with moral dilemmas. His curiosity and determination drive him to uncover the truth, often putting him at odds with those who would rather keep secrets buried.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training

Mikael's physical appearance reflects his tough exterior, with a rugged jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often mussed, giving him a disheveled appearance that can be intimidating.

**Interests:**

* Reading: Mikael has a deep love for literature, particularly the classics of European literature. He finds solace in the written word and often escapes into books when feeling overwhelmed.
* Martial Arts: As a private investigator, Mikael is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts. He believes that physical fitness is essential for mental clarity and focus.
* Investigation: Mikael's work as a private investigator is his true passion. He enjoys piecing together puzzles and unraveling mysteries, using his analytical mind to uncover the truth.

Outside of his work, Mikael has few interests beyond those mentioned above. His troubled past has made him wary of getting too close to others or forming attachments that might put him at risk. However, there is a sense that he is drawn to the enigmatic woman with piercing green eyes, suggesting that perhaps there are aspects of himself waiting to be rediscovered.
