Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Mikael Olsson:

**Physical Attributes:** Mikael appears to be a slender and introspective individual. His exact height is not specified, but based on his age and demeanor, it can be inferred that he is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. His eye color is brown, which seems to match the melancholic and introspective tone of his personality.

**Personality:** Mikael is a complex and emotionally charged individual, struggling with inner demons and self-doubt. He appears to be haunted by his past mistakes and relationships, particularly his tumultuous relationship with Emma. This emotional weight causes him to withdraw from social interactions and become preoccupied with his own thoughts. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that he is capable of introspection, self-awareness, and a desire for change.

**Interests:** Based on Mikael's behavior in the story, it can be inferred that he enjoys smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol (although this is mentioned to be a coping mechanism rather than an interest), and engaging in philosophical discussions with his friends. He also seems to appreciate the tranquility of nature, as evidenced by his appreciation for the sound of water flowing at the lock.

It's worth noting that Mikael's interests are not explicitly stated in the original story, so some of this information is inferred based on his behavior and interactions.
