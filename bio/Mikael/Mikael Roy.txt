Here's a summary of the fictional character Mikael Roy:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Mikael is likely in her mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, with an athletic yet slender build. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to move freely and easily navigate crowded spaces. Her hair is probably dark brown or black, worn in a practical style that doesn't distract from her work. Her eyes are bright green, piercing, and expressive, giving away her intense focus and curiosity.

**Personality:** 
Mikael is determined, resourceful, and fearless, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth. As a freelance journalist, she has learned to rely on herself and adapt quickly to new situations. Her quick wit and sharp instincts serve her well in high-pressure environments like underground fight clubs and corrupt city officials' offices.

**Interests:** 
Mikael is passionate about investigative journalism, driven by a desire to expose corruption and bring about change. She is fiercely curious and has a knack for sniffing out leads and piecing together seemingly unrelated facts. Her work often takes her into seedy underbelly of cities, where she must navigate danger, uncertainty, and moral gray areas.

Outside of work, Mikael's interests are likely more personal. Perhaps she enjoys hiking or exploring the natural world to clear her head after long days of research and investigation. She may also be a bookworm, devouring titles on history, politics, or sociology that help inform her reporting and analysis.

Her connection to The Bull and Kokoro suggests that Mikael is willing to take calculated risks and challenge authority when necessary, even if it means facing potential danger.
