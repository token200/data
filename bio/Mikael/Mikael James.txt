The story doesn't provide any additional details about Mikael's physical appearance beyond these two attributes, so I've made them up. The piercing blue eyes suggest a sharp intellect and intense focus, while the height of 5'10" implies a lean and agile build.

He spends most of his time studying research papers, conducting experiments, and developing new technologies related to memory and cognitive function. His curiosity about the workings of the human mind drives him to push the boundaries of what is thought possible.

These interests are closely tied to his work as a scientist, and he seems to have no other hobbies or passions beyond his research. However, the story suggests that Mikael's discovery has opened up new avenues for research and treatment, implying that his work will continue to have a significant impact on people's lives in the future.
