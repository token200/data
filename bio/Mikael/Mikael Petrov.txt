**Personality:**
Mikael Petrov is a complex and rugged individual who has been shaped by his experiences in war. He is driven by a strong sense of duty and loyalty to those he cares about, particularly Lena, his old friend from home. Despite being haunted by the memories of what he's seen, Mikael displays an unwavering resilience that allows him to keep moving forward.

He is fiercely independent and has always been on the move, never staying in one place for too long. This self-reliance stems from a sense of vulnerability stemming from his war-torn homeland. However, there are moments when he cracks and lets go of his stoicism, such as when reading the note warning him that "they're coming for you."

He values movement and freedom above all else, and moving forward seems like a means of survival for him.
