Here is a summary of Mikael Krumins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mikael Krumins stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of living on the streets and engaging in high-adrenaline activities. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up and searching for hidden truths. His chiseled features - strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and prominent nose - give him a rugged, battle-hardened appearance that belies his creative soul.

**Personality:**
Mikael is a complex, enigmatic individual with a dry wit and a sharp mind. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to keep to himself rather than seek the spotlight. Despite this, he has an uncanny ability to read people and situations, making him an exceptional mediator and advisor in high-stakes business deals. Mikael is fiercely loyal to those he trusts, particularly Emma, with whom he shares a deep bond.

**Interests:**
As a former street artist turned entrepreneur, Mikael's creative instincts remain strong. He continues to express himself through art, albeit in more subtle ways than before. His passions lie in the world of business and politics, where his strategic mind and quick wit can be applied to navigate the complex web of modern capitalism. When not working, Mikael enjoys exploring new cities, sipping coffee with friends (as seen with Emma), and indulging in high-stakes games that challenge his wits.

One might also imagine Mikael having an affinity for luxury cars, rare art pieces, or exclusive clubs, reflecting his entrepreneurial savvy and taste for the finer things in life. However, despite his success, he remains grounded and focused on his craft, leaving the world of high-society to those who crave it.
