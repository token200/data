She's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-preservation, which has helped her survive the harsh streets of Moscow. Her past is shrouded in mystery, but it's clear that she's learned to rely only on herself. Despite this tough exterior, Elise has a deep sense of satisfaction when her heists are successful, and she takes pride in her work as The Fox.

Elise's primary interest is thievery, with a particular focus on high-stakes heists and intricate planning. She enjoys the thrill of outsmarting security systems and gathering intelligence to stay one step ahead of her adversaries.

Outside of work, Elise has a fondness for rare books, ancient artifacts, and classical music â€“ she often listens to Chopin's nocturnes while working on her latest scheme.

When not plotting or executing heists, Elise is likely to spend time observing human behavior, studying people's reactions to danger and opportunity. She has an insatiable curiosity about the world around her and enjoys understanding how others think and act in high-pressure situations.
