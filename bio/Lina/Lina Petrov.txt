Based on the short story, here is a summary of Lina Petrov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lina appears to be a nostalgic and introspective person who values her roots and the connections she has with her hometown. She seems to be a bit of a free spirit, having left Ravenswood behind to pursue a life in the city, but is still tied to her past experiences and relationships. She also has a sense of humor, as evidenced by her wry smile when talking to Mrs. Jenkins.

**Physical Attributes:** Lina's physical attributes are not explicitly described in the story, but we can make some educated guesses based on her character. Here is a possible profile:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This height seems fitting for a person who has grown up and moved away from their hometown.
* Eye Color: Brown or hazel - These colors are common in people of Slavic descent, which is suggested by Lina's surname "Petrov."
* Hair Color: Dark brown or auburn - These hair colors are also consistent with her Slavic heritage.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it seems that Lina has a strong connection to her hometown and its people. She appears to be interested in:

* Exploring the outdoors and appreciating nature (as evidenced by her love of walking through the woods).
* Rebuilding her life and forging new relationships (as suggested by her plans with Mrs. Jenkins).
* Reflecting on her past experiences and reconnecting with old friends and acquaintances.
* Appreciating the sense of community and belonging that comes from being in a small town.

It's also possible that Lina has interests outside of Ravenswood, such as pursuing a career or developing new skills, but these are not explicitly stated in the story.
