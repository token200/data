**Personality:** Lina is described as brilliant and reclusive, suggesting that she is intelligent and focused but also somewhat withdrawn from the world. Her determination to uncover the truth about her father's work demonstrates her driven and investigative nature. However, as she delves deeper into her research, she becomes increasingly obsessed, indicating a potential vulnerability to tunnel vision or fixation.

- Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - a relatively average height for an adult woman, which might suggest a balance between introverted and outgoing tendencies.
- Eye Color: Green or Hazel eyes could be fitting, as these colors often convey intelligence and introspection.
