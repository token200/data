Since the original character is not Lina Saldana, I will create a new fictional character inspired by the story.

Meet Emilia "Mia" Thompson, a 17-year-old high school student living in the futuristic city of New Eden. Mia is a shy and introverted individual who has a passion for computer science and coding. She stands at about 5'6" with long, curly brown hair and bright hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity whenever she's exploring new technologies.

Mia's love for technology often gets her into trouble as she sneaks into the local "hackers' guild" to learn more about the latest coding techniques and network security. Her curiosity is unmatched, and she has a natural talent for finding hidden patterns and vulnerabilities in even the most secure systems.

Despite her reserved nature, Mia has a deep desire to understand the world around her. She spends countless hours exploring the internet, searching for answers to life's biggest questions and uncovering hidden truths. Her fascination with technology often leads her to stumble upon mysterious websites and online communities that blur the lines between reality and virtual reality.

As she delves deeper into the digital world, Mia begins to experience strange occurrences – her computer crashes, she receives cryptic messages from unknown sources, and she starts to feel like she's being watched by an invisible presence. Her obsession with uncovering the truth takes over her life, causing tension in her relationships with friends and family.

Mia's grades suffer as a result of her newfound passion for coding and hacking, but she can't help herself. She's driven by a desire to understand the mysteries of the internet and the world around her. As she navigates the dark corners of the web, Mia starts to realize that the boundaries between reality and virtual reality are not as solid as they seem.

In the end, it's unclear whether Mia has truly escaped the trap of the mysterious websites or if they've simply retreated into the shadows, waiting for their next victim. One thing is certain – Mia's journey into the dark corners of the internet has left an indelible mark on her life, and she will never be the same again.

Some additional details to flesh out Mia's character:

- She has a small tattoo of a circuit board on her left wrist.
- Her favorite book is "Neuromancer" by William Gibson.
- She loves listening to ambient electronic music while coding.
- Mia's best friend is an artist named Jax, who often helps her visualize the digital concepts she's working with.
- She has a secret online alias, "Zero Cool," which she uses to interact with other hackers and enthusiasts in the dark corners of the web.
