Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Lina Askarov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lina appears to be someone with a strong emotional connection and deep feelings. She has a sense of empathy and understanding, as evident in her ability to feel what others are going through (as seen in the line "She knew what it was like to be in hiding, to have to constantly look over your shoulder"). Her feelings for the man are intense and romantic, suggesting that she values emotional intimacy and connection. She's also willing to put herself in danger to support someone she cares about.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is only one physical attribute mentioned in the story: Lina's "long dark hair." It's not specified what her height is or eye color, so I will make some assumptions:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - This is a relatively average height for most adults and would fit with the description of her as someone who moves easily through crowds.
* Eye Color: Hazel or green eyes - These are both colors that are often associated with Eastern European or Russian heritage, which might be fitting given the character's surname.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Lina is passionate about social justice and exposing corruption. She seems to be someone who values authenticity and honesty, as she is drawn to the man's sincerity and willingness to speak out against injustice. Her interests may also include politics, activism, and personal relationships.
