Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Lina Ming-che's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Lina Ming-che appears to be a determined and driven individual who is passionate about calligraphy. She is also shown to be confident in her abilities, as evidenced by her willingness to take on the rigorous tests set by Mr. Li. Her humility and ability to learn from her grandfather and Mr. Li demonstrate her growth and appreciation for knowledge.

Physical Attributes: Unfortunately, there are no specific details provided about Lina Ming-che's physical attributes beyond those mentioned in connection with her calligraphy practice (such as hands and eyes). However, we can make some educated guesses based on the story:

- Height: Given that Lina was a young girl watching her grandfather practice, it is likely that she is of a petite or slender build. It would be unrealistic for her to be taller than an average adult in a traditional setting.
- Eye Color: The text does not specify Lina's eye color, but based on the Asian cultural context mentioned in the story (her grandfather and Mr. Li), it is reasonable to assume that she may have brown or possibly green eyes.

Interests: As the story emphasizes, calligraphy is Lina Ming-che's primary interest. Her fascination with ancient art forms and her dedication to mastering the craft suggest a lifelong passion for creative expression.

Additional details not explicitly mentioned in the text include:

- Hair color: Given the cultural context, it would be plausible for Lina Ming-che to have dark brown or black hair.
- Height: Assuming an average adult height of around 5'4" (162.56 cm), this seems a reasonable estimate for someone who started calligraphy as a child and has continued into adulthood.

Note that these details are speculative, and the actual physical attributes of Lina Ming-che might differ based on individual interpretation or additional information from other sources.
