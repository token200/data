Based on the short story, here is a summary of Lina Avendano's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lina appears to be a determined and resourceful individual, driven by her desire to find out what happened to her sister Emily. She is also curious and persistent, as evidenced by her willingness to follow up on every lead. Her tone is generally serious and focused, with only occasional moments of comfort or reassurance (as seen when Carlos offers her coffee). However, Lina's emotions can shift quickly, as indicated by her heart skipping a beat when she meets Lily.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide explicit details about Lina's physical appearance. However, based on the context and the author's style, it is likely that Lina is an adult woman of average build and height, probably around 5'6"-5'8" (168 cm-173 cm). Her eye color is not mentioned in the story, but based on the description of Lily's piercing green eyes, it's possible that Lina has a similar eye color or perhaps something slightly darker.

**Interests:** It is clear that Lina is deeply invested in finding out what happened to her sister Emily. She is searching for information and trying to follow every lead, no matter how small. Her interest in her sister's disappearance is likely driven by a mix of emotional need (to understand what happened) and a desire for closure.
