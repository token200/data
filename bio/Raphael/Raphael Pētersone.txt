- Hair: Jet black, often styled impeccably to accentuate his angular features

**Personality:**
Raphael is enigmatic and elusive, preferring to operate in the shadows. He exudes an aura of confidence and authority, making him a compelling figure in high-stakes art dealing circles. His eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if searching for hidden secrets or weaknesses. Despite his reserved nature, Raphael has a subtle sense of humor that surfaces only when least expected.

**Interests:**
Raphael is driven by two main passions:
1. **Art**: He is an art aficionado with a deep understanding of various styles and movements. His network spans the globe, from galleries in New York to Tokyo's most exclusive art spaces.
