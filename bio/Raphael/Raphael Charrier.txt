Here is a summary of Raphael Charrier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Raphael Charrier is a complex and multi-faceted individual. On the surface, he appears aloof and unapproachable, which can be intimidating to those who don't know him. However, as Maria discovered, this fa√ßade hides a passionate and nuanced person who is deeply committed to his work. He is fiercely intelligent and has a dry sense of humor, which he reveals when he smiles wryly or twinkles with amusement.

**Physical Attributes:** Raphael Charrier stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up and assessing their intellect. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly and precisely, framing his angular features.

**Interests:** Raphael's primary interest lies in the study of black holes, which has consumed most of his adult life. He is an expert in this field and is known for pushing the boundaries of conventional wisdom, always seeking new insights and discoveries. Outside of astrophysics, he enjoys reading classical literature, particularly the works of Proust and Joyce, and plays a mediocre game of chess in his free time.

It's worth noting that Raphael's physical attributes are not explicitly stated in the original story, so I had to make some educated guesses based on the context provided. Similarly, his interests go beyond astrophysics, as hinted at by his appreciation for classical literature and chess.
