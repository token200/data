Here is a summary of the fictional character Raphael Oja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Black, often messy and unkempt due to wind whipping through it as mentioned in the short story
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, with a hint of ruggedness from spending time outdoors

**Personality:**

* Raphael is a introspective and creative individual who has learned to channel his grief into his art.
* He is deeply emotional and often lost in thought, but has developed coping mechanisms to manage his pain and find solace in his work.
* Despite his melancholy demeanor, he exudes a sense of hope and optimism, as evidenced by his determination to continue creating and finding beauty in the world around him.

**Interests:**

* Painting, particularly capturing the vibrant colors and textures of nature
* Spending time outdoors, such as walking along the lake's shore or sailing on its waters
* Exploring the intersection of art and spirituality, often incorporating symbolic elements into his work

It's worth noting that Raphael seems to be a bit of an introvert, preferring the solitude of his artistic pursuits over social interactions. However, this is likely due to his grief and need for self-reflection rather than any inherent personality trait.
