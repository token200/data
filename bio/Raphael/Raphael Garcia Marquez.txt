Based on the inspiration provided by the story about Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I've created a fictional character profile for Raphael Garcia Marquez:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of gold, reminiscent of the warm sand and sun-kissed streets of Cartagena
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a neat and tidy manner to blend in with his librarian persona
- Face Shape: Oval, with high cheekbones and a strong jawline that speaks to his passion for words and poetry

Personality:
Raphael is a complex individual, much like the masked poet El Loco. By day, he exudes a calm and gentle demeanor as the humble librarian in Cartagena's town square. However, behind closed doors or when writing under his pseudonym, Raphael transforms into a passionate and fiery soul. His words are infused with a deep sense of love, longing, and introspection, making him a magnetic figure to those who cross his path.

Interests:
- Poetry: As El Loco, Raphael is deeply invested in the art form, pouring his heart and soul into each verse he writes. He finds solace in the creative process and is constantly seeking new ways to express himself.
- Music: Raphael has a deep love for the sounds of Colombia's rich musical heritage, from vallenato to salsa. When alone, he often hums or whistles along to his favorite tunes as inspiration strikes.
- Literature: As a librarian, Raphael is surrounded by the works of countless authors and poets. He finds himself drawn to the romanticism and passion of 19th-century Spanish literature, which inspires him to write from the heart.

Habits:
- Whenever feeling stuck or uninspired, Raphael takes a walk along the winding streets of Cartagena at dawn, listening for the sounds of the city waking up.
- He has a habit of collecting rare books and manuscripts in his free time, often leaving them on his library shelf as a reminder of the magic that lies within their pages.

Secrets:
Raphael's pseudonym, El Loco, is not just a mask he wears but also a reflection of his true self. As El Loco, he finds freedom to express himself without fear or restraint, allowing his words to take on a life of their own. Those who know him well whisper that beneath the surface of this quiet librarian lies a poet with a fire that burns brighter than the most passionate love letter.
