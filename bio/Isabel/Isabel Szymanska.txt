Isabel's fascination with mythology and folklore also extends beyond her hacking persona. She sees herself as a modern-day mythmaker, weaving tales of digital espionage and counter-intelligence into the fabric of her work. This creative outlet allows her to maintain a sense of control and agency in a world where she is often forced to operate on the fringes.
