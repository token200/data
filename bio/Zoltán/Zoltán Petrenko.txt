Here's a summary of the fictional character Zoltán Petrenko:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Dark brown
- Hair: Jet-black and styled with a hint of messiness, often falling across his forehead.
- Build: Slim but athletic, reflecting years of regular exercise and outdoor activities.
- Face: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing dark eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:**
Zoltán is an intellectual powerhouse, driven by a passion for understanding human behavior. His mind is constantly racing with theories and hypotheses, making him an exceptional forensic psychologist. He has a dry sense of humor, which occasionally catches people off guard, but beneath his reserved exterior lies a sharp and insightful individual. Zoltán's years of experience have left emotional scars, however, as he often finds himself delving into the darkest corners of human nature.

**Interests:**
Zoltán is an avid reader of psychology texts, particularly those focusing on the darker aspects of the human mind. His extensive knowledge of psychological theories and case studies serves him well in his work as a forensic psychologist. He enjoys long walks along the Danube River at night, lost in thought, trying to connect seemingly unrelated pieces of information. Zoltán is also an ardent fan of 20th-century Hungarian jazz music, often listening to it during quiet moments when he needs relaxation.

Despite being deeply involved with cases that can take a toll on his mental well-being, Zoltán has an undeniable fascination for the intricacies of human psychology and the art of deduction.
