Here's a summary of the fictional character Zoltán Sikora:

Physical Attributes:
Zoltán is a tall, lean man in his mid-to-late 40s. He stands at around 6 feet (183 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of living off the grid and engaging in physically demanding activities. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly but not too perfectly, giving off an air of ruggedness. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, exuding a sense of intensity and focus. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his enigmatic appearance.

Personality:
Zoltán is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears aloof and detached, preferring to keep people at arm's length. However, beneath this exterior lies a deep sense of empathy and compassion. He is driven by a strong moral compass, which led him to leave the morally ambiguous world of SZABRÁK behind. Zoltán is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries when he deems it necessary.

Despite his tough exterior, Zoltán has a dry sense of humor and can be witty and charming when the situation calls for it. He has a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. His past experiences have left him with emotional scars, but he is slowly learning to confront his demons and find closure.

Interests:
Zoltán's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his varied career as a freelance operative. He has a deep passion for history, particularly the history of Hungary and Eastern Europe during World War II and the Cold War era. This fascination stems from his work with SZABRÁK, where he was exposed to classified information about the region's complex past.

In addition to his historical interests, Zoltán is an avid outdoorsman, enjoying activities like hiking, rock climbing, and skiing in his free time. He has a strong affinity for languages, speaking fluent Hungarian, English, German, and Russian. Music plays a significant role in his life as well; he enjoys classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which bring him a sense of peace and calm.

When not working on a case or engaging in physical activities, Zoltán can often be found reading about philosophy, psychology, or sociology, seeking to understand human behavior and the complexities of the world around him.
