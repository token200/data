Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Zoltán Nagy:

**Physical Attributes:** Zoltán is a man in his mid-30s with an unassuming appearance. He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall with a lean build, allowing him to move freely between the café's bustling atmosphere and the quiet streets he explores with his mysterious muse. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to hold a hint of sadness, a reflection of his past life before the world's influence took its toll. His hair is dark and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face with an air of ruggedness.

**Personality:** Zoltán is a creative soul who has been hiding behind the mask of a barista, afraid to express himself due to the world's constraints on his artistic expression. When he met his mysterious muse, he was drawn to her intensity and passion for art and music. He is curious and open-minded, allowing himself to be guided by this enigmatic woman into uncharted territories. As he begins to rediscover his creative spark, Zoltán becomes more confident and self-assured, embracing his true potential as an artist.

**Interests:** Before the mysterious encounter, Zoltán's passions lay in art and music, with a deep appreciation for the works of master artists and musicians who dared to push boundaries. He spent most of his free time sketching, painting, and playing music, though these activities were confined to small, amateur circles due to his fear of rejection. With the help of his muse, Zoltán's creative interests are reignited, and he becomes consumed by the process of art-making, pouring his emotions and experiences onto canvases and into melodies.

Additionally, Zoltán develops an interest in exploring hidden corners and secret spots within the city, reflecting a growing sense of curiosity about the world beyond the confines of his daily routine. This newfound desire for discovery is likely fueled by his muse's guidance and encouragement, helping him to see the beauty in unexpected places.
