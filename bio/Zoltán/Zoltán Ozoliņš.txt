Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Zoltán Ozoliņš:

**Personality:** Zoltán Ozoliņš is a complex and introspective individual with a history of ambition and idealism. As a former politician, he was once driven by a strong sense of conviction and passion for change. However, after abandoning his ambitions and losing sight of his goals, he has become lost and disconnected from himself. Despite this, there is still a spark of determination within him, which is reignited when he reconnects with an old friend who challenges him to rekindle his flame.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dull gray (formerly bright and full of conviction)
* Hair: Dark brown, unkempt, and often disheveled
* Facial Features: Weathered and worn from years of disappointment and disillusionment

**Interests:** Zoltán's interests are primarily centered around politics, activism, and social justice. In his younger years, he was an active participant in Latvian opposition movements, using his charisma and persuasive abilities to rally support for various causes. Although he has largely abandoned this path, there is a hint of his old passion still lingering within him.

It's worth noting that Zoltán's current lifestyle consists mainly of self-pity, indulgence in alcohol, and regret over past choices. The brief spark of interest ignited by Viktorija's visit marks the beginning of a potential resurgence of his lost ambitions, suggesting that he may be on the cusp of rediscovering his purpose and re-engaging with the world around him.
