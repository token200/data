Here is a summary of Zoltán Mustermann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zoltán Mustermann is an enigmatic and eccentric individual who prefers the company of inanimate objects to people. He is not antisocial, but rather selective about his social interactions, which can be puzzling to those around him. Despite this, he exudes a sense of calm confidence and intellectual curiosity. As shown in his encounter with Sophie, Zoltán has a dry sense of humor and can be disarmingly polite when the situation calls for it.

**Physical Attributes:** Zoltán is a slender man in his late 50s, with an unassuming height of around 5'8" (173 cm). His eyes are a deep shade of brown that twinkle behind thick, round glasses perched on the end of his nose. His dark hair is thinning at the temples and combed over to one side, adding to his somewhat disheveled appearance. Zoltán's attire consists of comfortable, worn tweed jackets and button-down shirts, giving off an air of academic professionalism.

**Interests:** As a master collector of unusual artifacts, Zoltán has a fascination with the peculiar and the forgotten. He is drawn to objects that hold secrets or whisper tales of a bygone era. His collection includes antique door knobs, vintage typewriters, taxidermied owls wearing top hats (which Sophie witnesses during their encounter), and other enigmatic items that spark his curiosity. Zoltán's true passion lies in uncovering the hidden histories and stories behind these artifacts, which he believes hold the key to understanding a world lost to time.

Overall, Zoltán Mustermann is an intriguing figure whose reclusive nature belies a rich inner life and an insatiable appetite for the strange and unknown.
