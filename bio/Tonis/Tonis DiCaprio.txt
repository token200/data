Based on the inspiration from Leonardo DiCaprio, I've created a fictional character profile for Tonis DiCaprio:

**Physical Attributes:**
Tonis DiCaprio stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build. He has a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, giving him a laid-back, surfer-dude vibe.

**Personality:**
Tonis DiCaprio is a passionate and driven individual who wears his heart on his sleeve. He's fiercely dedicated to environmental causes and isn't afraid to speak out about the issues that matter most to him. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for underdogs and is always willing to lend a helping hand.

**Interests:**
In addition to his love of the ocean, Tonis DiCaprio enjoys surfing, hiking, and playing guitar in his free time. He's also an avid reader and devour books on history, philosophy, and environmental science. When he's not working on a film project or advocating for a cause, you can find him experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen or attempting to brew his own craft beer.

**Additional Details:**
Tonis DiCaprio was born on November 12th (or so he claims - he prefers to keep his birthday private). He's a bit of a hopeless romantic and has been known to get lost in the pages of a good novel. Despite his fame, he remains humble and grounded, always looking for ways to make a positive impact on the world around him.

Note: Please keep in mind that Tonis DiCaprio is not a real person and any resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio is purely coincidental!
