Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Egor Evans:

**Personality:** Egor is a sharp-witted and resourceful individual with an insatiable passion for mystery and intrigue. He possesses a keen mind and instincts that serve him well in his work as a detective. His determination and resolve are unwavering, even when faced with cryptic clues or challenging obstacles. Egor's analytical nature and ability to think critically make him a formidable detective.

**Physical Attributes:** Egor is a tall, imposing figure standing at around 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential clues or hidden motives. His dark hair is often neatly styled, and his sharp jawline adds to his air of intensity.

**Interests:** Egor's primary interest lies in solving mysteries and uncovering the truth behind complex puzzles. He has a keen eye for detail and enjoys piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments to form a cohesive picture. In addition to his detective work, Egor is likely an avid reader of books on history, philosophy, and psychology, all of which contribute to his analytical mind.

In terms of hobbies or interests outside of detective work, it's possible that Egor enjoys long walks through the Moscow streets at night, observing the city's inhabitants and listening for whispers of potential leads. He might also be a skilled researcher, able to dig up obscure information from dusty archives or speaking with experts in various fields to gain new insights.

It's worth noting that the only personal detail explicitly mentioned in the short story is Egor's surname (Evans) being of Ivanovich origin, but I have filled out his full name as Egor Ivanovich Evans.
