Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Egor González's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egor is portrayed as a skilled and dedicated individual with a strong sense of duty. He is driven by a desire to protect the kingdom and maintain the balance of power, which suggests that he is loyal and committed to his goals. His ability to think on his feet and navigate complex situations implies that he is resourceful and cunning.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no detailed physical attributes are mentioned in the story. However, based on the context, I can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Egor's height is not specified, but given the fact that he moves with ease through the shadows and navigates narrow underground tunnels, it's possible that he is lean and agile, suggesting a height range of around 5'8" to 6'2".
* Eye Color: The story doesn't provide any information about Egor's eye color. However, based on his affinity for Shadow Weaving, which often involves manipulating darkness and shadows, I would speculate that his eyes are an unusual shade, such as emerald green or indigo blue.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it appears that Egor's interests include:

* Mastering the ancient art of Shadow Weaving: As a member of the González clan, Egor has been trained in this complex and nuanced form of magic from a young age.
* Strategic thinking and planning: Egor's ability to infiltrate rival factions and gather intelligence suggests that he is a skilled strategist and tactician.
* Protecting the kingdom and maintaining balance: As the youngest son of the González clan, Egor feels a strong sense of responsibility to protect the kingdom and maintain the delicate balance between light and darkness.

These interests are likely closely tied to his role as a member of the ruling council's special task force and his mission to retrieve the Shadowstone.
