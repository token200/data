Here's a summary of Egor Fournier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egor Fournier is an enigmatic and mysterious individual with a charming exterior. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or detached to those who don't know him. However, beneath his polished facade lies a complex web of emotions and motivations. As a former spy, he has spent years honing his skills in deception and manipulation, making him a master of hiding his true intentions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a hint of gray that seems to deepen when he's interested
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly but with a slightly unkempt texture that hints at his rough past
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, honed from years of martial arts training and espionage
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow (a souvenir from one of his many close calls)

**Interests:** Egor's interests are multifaceted and seemingly contradictory. On the surface, he is an avid woodworker, finding solace in the tactile nature of crafting furniture. However, beneath this hobby lies a deeper passion for strategy and game-playing. As a former spy, he has always been drawn to puzzles, codes, and other forms of intellectual challenge.

Additionally, Egor has a fascination with the darker aspects of human nature, often exploring themes of morality, loyalty, and power in his woodworking pieces. His creations seem to take on a life of their own, imbued with subtle hints of danger and allure that reflect his own personality.
