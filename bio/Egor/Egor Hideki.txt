However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deeply introspective and empathetic person. He has a strong sense of justice and is fiercely loyal to those in need. Egor's past experiences have made him guarded and secretive, but he is capable of profound transformation when confronted with the right challenges.

**Interests:** Egor Hideki's interests are multifaceted and driven by his desire for challenge and personal growth. He is an avid student of history, particularly the ancient cultures of Japan, which has deepened his understanding of the mystical properties of the golden statue.

In addition to his fascination with the statue, Egor is also intrigued by cryptography, code-breaking, and the art of disguise.
