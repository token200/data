**Personality:** Egor is a complex individual with a tough exterior that belies a fiercely compassionate heart. He has a natural sense of justice and will go to great lengths to uncover the truth and protect those in need.

Outside of his work as a detective, Egor is a man of few vices but many interests. He enjoys reading history books, particularly those focused on Russian revolutionary movements, and has a deep appreciation for classical music and the works of Tolstoy. Despite his rough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and enjoys cracking jokes with those close to him.
