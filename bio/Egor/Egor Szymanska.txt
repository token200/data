Here is a summary of Egor Szymanska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egor is known for his unassuming demeanor, which allows him to blend in seamlessly with his surroundings. He has a knack for getting out of tight spots, which suggests that he is resourceful and intelligent. Despite his tough exterior, he is also fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about. As a former thief turned bounty hunter, Egor has developed a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to take down his targets if they have wronged others.

**Physical Attributes:** Egor stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build that allows him to move quickly and quietly through the shadows. His dark hair is often worn long, framing his sharp features and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he encounters. He has a scattering of scars across his face and neck, testaments to his rough past as a thief.

**Interests:** Egor's interests are largely centered around his work as a bounty hunter and his desire for justice. However, he also seems to have a deep-seated curiosity about the world around him, which drives him to uncover hidden truths and unravel complex mysteries. He is likely an avid reader of history and literature, given his ability to piece together puzzles and outsmart his adversaries. Additionally, Egor appears to enjoy the thrill of the chase, taking pride in outwitting his targets and staying one step ahead.

One interesting aspect of Egor's personality is that he has a hard time opening up about his personal life or emotions, especially when it comes to his family. The revelation that his long-lost brother was the notorious counterfeiter "The Fox" suggests that there may be more depth to Egor than meets the eye, and that he is not as self-assured as he initially appears.
