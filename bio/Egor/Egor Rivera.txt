Here is a summary of Egor Rivera's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Egor is a determined and resourceful individual who is driven by a strong sense of justice. He is fiercely loyal to his family and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about his brother's disappearance. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side and is empathetic towards those affected by Alex's investigation.

**Physical Attributes:** Egor stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with short, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a messy manner. His eyes are a deep blue, which contrasts with the piercing green of Sofia's eyes, which he finds captivating. He has a lean build, honed from years of chasing stories and dealing with the physical demands of journalism.

**Interests:** As an American journalist, Egor is passionate about investigative reporting and storytelling. He is fascinated by politics, social justice, and human rights, particularly in South America. His interests also include photography (although Alex's disappearance seems to have stalled his own career at the time). Before Alex's disappearance, Egor was working on a story about corruption in Argentina, but his brother's investigation put him in a position where he had to take a break from the project.

In Buenos Aires, Egor is particularly drawn to the city's vibrant culture, street art, and music scene. He spends much of his time exploring the city, talking to locals, and gathering information about Alex's disappearance. His interests also extend to learning more about Argentine history, politics, and social movements, which will likely play a crucial role in uncovering the truth about his brother's fate.
