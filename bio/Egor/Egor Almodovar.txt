Here is a summary of Egor Almodovar's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Egor stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His eyes are an intense shade of indigo, almost purple in color, which seems to hold a deep intensity. His dark hair is often unruly, framing his angular face with a hint of messiness.

**Personality:**
Egor's personality is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the turmoil that has shaped him throughout his life. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often pushing boundaries in both his art and personal relationships. Egor's demons have left emotional scars, making him intensely vulnerable and guarded around those he trusts. Despite this, he has a deep capacity for empathy and kindness, particularly when it comes to Sophia.

**Interests:**
Egor is passionate about his art, pouring all of himself into every brushstroke. He finds solace in the creative process, often losing track of time as he works on a new piece. In addition to painting, Egor has a deep love for literature and poetry, finding inspiration in the works of Russian masters like Dostoevsky and Tsvetaeva.

Egor's interests also extend beyond art and literature to music, particularly jazz and classical compositions that evoke the intensity and emotion he seeks to capture in his own work. When not creating, Egor can be found strolling through Moscow's streets or exploring Parisian cafes, soaking up inspiration from the world around him.

As his relationship with Sophia deepens, Egor becomes increasingly drawn to spirituality and philosophy, seeking a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world. He finds comfort in conversations about existentialism, mysticism, and the human condition, often spending hours discussing these themes with Sophia over coffee or long walks along the Seine.

Overall, Egor's personality is a rich tapestry of contradictions – intense yet vulnerable, creative yet guarded – but ultimately driven by a fierce passion for life, art, and connection.
