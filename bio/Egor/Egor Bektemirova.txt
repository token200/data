**Personality:** Egor is a determined and principled individual who holds strong convictions about literature and its power to challenge social norms. She appears to be introspective and thoughtful, often feeling disconnected from her surroundings due to the rapid changes in Moscow's society. Despite this, she is driven by a sense of duty and responsibility towards her work and the people around her.

**Physical Attributes:** Egor has an unlisted height of 5'8" (173 cm), indicating that she may be slightly above average height for a Russian woman. Her eye color is described as dark brown, adding depth to her expression. The only physical attribute explicitly mentioned in the short story is a faded Lenin patch on the sleeve of her parka, suggesting a nostalgic connection to the Soviet era.

**Interests:** Egor's interests appear to revolve around literature and social commentary. She has a deep appreciation for books and the written word, having grown up learning Russian and devouring literature from the local library as a child. Her work as an editor at a state-owned publishing house suggests that she is passionate about promoting authors' voices and ideas, even if they challenge the current government's message.

In addition to her literary interests, Egor seems to value authenticity, self-expression, and social responsibility. She is willing to take small risks and engage in subtle acts of resistance to promote these values, which are now feeling increasingly silenced in Moscow.
