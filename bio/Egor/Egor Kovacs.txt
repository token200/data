He is fiercely intelligent and has a dry sense of humor, often lost on those who don't share his passion for scientific inquiry. Despite his intelligence, he can be impulsive and reckless at times, which may have contributed to his downfall in manipulating the fabric of reality.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with a piercing quality that misses nothing
* Hair: Dark brown, often worn unkempt and long
* Build: Lean and wiry, with a wiry physique honed from years of intense physical labor in his laboratory

**Interests:** Egor's primary interest is time itself. He has dedicated his life to studying the mysteries of chronology, experimenting with theories of relativity, and developing technologies that can manipulate reality at its most fundamental level. He is also deeply curious about the nature of existence, the human condition, and the intricacies of causality.

Beyond science, Egor is an avid reader of philosophy, history, and literature, devouring texts on subjects ranging from ancient Greek thinkers to modern theoretical physics. His love for learning drives him to explore new ideas and challenge conventional wisdom, often blurring the lines between scientific inquiry and existential contemplation.

In his younger years, Egor also had a passion for playing the piano, but this interest was eventually set aside as he became increasingly consumed by his work on time manipulation technology.
