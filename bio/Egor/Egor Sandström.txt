**Physical Attributes:**
Egor stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and short, often styled in a practical manner for his rugged lifestyle. His eyes are a piercing blue, often seeming to bore into those he meets. His facial features are chiseled, reflecting a mix of Scandinavian and Eastern European heritage.

**Personality:**
Egor's personality is complex and multi-faceted. On the surface, he appears stoic and detached, with an air of quiet confidence that commands respect. However, beneath this façade lies a deeply troubled individual who has been shaped by his experiences in Special Forces and as a mercenary. He has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but also possesses a deep sense of loyalty and duty to those he considers friends or allies.

Egor's past traumas have left emotional scars, causing him to maintain a certain distance from others. Yet, this also fuels his determination and drive to protect himself and those he cares about.

**Interests:**
Despite his tough exterior, Egor has a deep appreciation for solitude and nature. The frozen wilderness, with its vast expanses of snow-covered terrain and eerie silence, holds a strange allure for him. He finds solace in the stillness of the landscape, which allows him to clear his mind and focus on his goals.

Egor is also an avid listener, often preferring to observe and listen rather than speak. This skill has served him well in his line of work, where stealth and strategy are crucial. In his downtime, he enjoys listening to classical music or podcasts, which helps him unwind and relax.

In terms of hobbies, Egor does not have many in the classical sense. His experiences as a mercenary have taught him the value of practical skills like marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and wilderness survival. While he may enjoy a good game of chess or a whiskey-fueled night with friends, these activities are relatively rare and usually reserved for moments of relaxation.

Overall, Egor Sandström is a complex and intriguing character, driven by a mix of motivations that both define and haunt him. His unique blend of rugged individualism, loyalty, and quiet desperation makes him a compelling and formidable figure in the world of espionage and mercenary work.
