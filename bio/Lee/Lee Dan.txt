Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Lee Dan:

**Personality:** Lee Dan is described as having a passion for calligraphy that is undeniable. Her dedication to perfecting her craft is unparalleled, suggesting that she is hardworking and committed to excellence. She also has a humble side, as evidenced by her willingness to take on custom commissions and create bespoke pieces for others.

While not much about her personality is explicitly stated in the story, it can be inferred that Lee Dan is likely introverted or at least not overly extroverted, given that she is more focused on her art than on seeking out social recognition. However, when surrounded by people who appreciate her work, such as the businessman and the attendees at his annual gala, she seems to feel a sense of pride and happiness.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide explicit details about Lee Dan's physical appearance. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the cultural context in which calligraphy is practiced. 

She appears to be East Asian (based on her mother being mentioned as an influence) with darker hair colors and possibly brown or black eyes since very few people from these regions have blue eyes.

However, I made an assumption that isn't explicitly present within this text so let's just stick with the information we do have.

**Interests:** Lee Dan's primary interest is calligraphy. As a child, she watched her mother create intricate characters on silk paper, and later, she discovered an old leather-bound book in an antique shop that sparked her true passion for the art form. Her life revolves around mastering various techniques, styles, and artists' works presented in the book.

She also expresses an interest in creating pieces that capture the essence of each artist who came before her.
