Here is a summary of Lee Kovacs' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lee Kovacs is a determined and resourceful individual who is driven by justice. She has a strong sense of independence and can come across as aloof or guarded to those who don't know her. After leaving law enforcement due to a traumatic event, she has had to rebuild herself as a private investigator, which has given her a sense of purpose and motivation. Despite this, she still struggles with emotional scars from her past, which sometimes surface when faced with difficult cases.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, almost black
* Hair Color: Short, dark brown hair that often falls across her forehead
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and a small scar above her left eyebrow (a result of the traumatic event in her past)

**Interests:** Lee Kovacs is an avid reader and researcher, always looking for new leads and information to help crack cases. She is also a skilled driver and has a deep knowledge of the city's streets and neighborhoods, which helps her navigate the urban landscape. Outside of work, she enjoys taking long walks in the rain (much like on the day described in the story) to clear her mind and reflect on her thoughts.
