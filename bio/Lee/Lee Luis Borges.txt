Despite his many accomplishments, he remains an outsider to the mainstream world, preferring the company of like-minded individuals who share his passion for intellectual pursuits.

**Quirks:** Borges has a habit of scribbling notes on scraps of paper when deep in thought, often creating elaborate diagrams or equations that seem to make no sense at first glance. He is also known to be a voracious reader, devouring books on philosophy, science fiction, and mathematics with an insatiable appetite.
