I'd be happy to create a fictional character named Lee Dolera. Based on the TV series "Queer as Folk," I'll draw inspiration from the show's characters and craft a new character with similar traits.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown
* Hair Color: Dark blond
* Body Type: Lean and athletic

**Personality:**

Lee is a charismatic and confident individual who is unapologetic about his desires. He's outgoing, witty, and has a quick sense of humor that makes him endearing to those around him. However, beneath his charming exterior lies a vulnerable and sensitive soul who has been hurt in past relationships.

**Background:**

Lee grew up in a conservative household with traditional values. As a result, he had to navigate his own identity and desires within the confines of his family's expectations. He eventually left home to explore his life and figure out who he is, leading him to discover his passion for art and performance.

**Interests:**

* Music: Lee is an avid music lover and plays the guitar. He enjoys singing and songwriting as a way to express himself.
* Art: As mentioned earlier, Lee has a creative side. He's been known to draw, paint, and sculpt in his free time.
* Theater: Lee loves performing on stage and has been involved in various theater productions throughout his life.
* LGBTQ+ rights: Despite the conservative background he came from, Lee is passionate about fighting for equality and acceptance within the LGBTQ+ community.

**Notable Traits:**

* Lee is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. He will go to great lengths to support and protect them.
* He has a strong sense of justice and isn't afraid to speak his mind when it comes to issues that matter to him.
* Despite his confident exterior, Lee struggles with self-doubt and fear of rejection.

I hope this character summary meets your requirements! If you'd like me to continue developing the story or create a new character, please let me know.
