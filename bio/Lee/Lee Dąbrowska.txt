**Physical Attributes:**
Lee is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in a messy bob that frames her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a bright, piercing green, a trait she inherited from her Polish ancestors. She has a small nose ring and a tattoo of a pen nib on her left wrist, symbolizing her passion for journalism.

Her tenacity and razor-sharp instincts make her a formidable journalist, always ready to take on the toughest challenges. She is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to uncover stories that others might deem too sensitive or too hot to handle.

Despite her tough exterior, Lee has a compassionate side and is deeply empathetic towards those affected by corruption and injustice. Her warm smile and kind eyes put even the most skeptical interviewees at ease, allowing her to gather invaluable insights from her sources.

**Interests:**
Lee's passions extend far beyond journalism. She is an avid reader of history books, particularly those on Polish history and culture. In her free time, she enjoys practicing yoga and hiking in the Tatra Mountains, where she finds solace in nature and inspiration for her stories.

Lee is also a talented musician, playing the violin since childhood. Music has always been her escape, providing an outlet for creative expression and emotional release. She often listens to classical music while working on her reports, finding that it helps her stay focused and calm under pressure.

With her boundless energy and insatiable curiosity, Lee Dąbrowska is a true journalist's journalist, always seeking the next great story and never backing down from a challenge.
