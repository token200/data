Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Lee Järv:

**Personality:** Lee Järv appears to be introspective and perhaps a bit lost in his career as a chef. He feels restless and nostalgic for warmer days, suggesting that he values freedom and a connection to nature. As he reconnects with his childhood home and the land, he begins to rediscover himself and find his purpose. He is open to new experiences and is willing to learn from those around him, such as old Maja.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Lee Järv is likely of average height for a man in Estonia, perhaps 170-180 cm (5'7"-5'11").
* Eye Color: His eye color is not specified, but based on Estonian culture and the author's use of descriptive language, it is possible that he has blue or green eyes.
* Hair Color: The text does not provide information about his hair color, but it is likely to be dark brown or blonde, typical of Estonians.

**Interests:** Lee Järv's childhood passions include:

* Exploring the natural world, particularly the frozen lakes and forests surrounding his village
* Building snowmen and making snow angels (a playful, carefree aspect of his personality)
* Fishing (though he never quite catches the elusive fish)

As an adult, he is drawn to cooking with a newfound appreciation for the land and its rhythms. He is inspired by the idea of creating a menu that reflects the natural world and is crafted with love and respect.

It's worth noting that Lee Järv's story suggests that his true interests lie in connecting with nature, listening to the land, and finding purpose through his relationship with it. His passion for cooking becomes more about sharing this connection with others rather than simply preparing meals.
