Here is a summary of the fictional character Blazej Jankowski:

**Physical Attributes:** Blazej stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, likely honed from years of physical labor. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his sharp facial features and angular jawline. His eyes are a piercing green, almost like a cat's, which seem to gleam with intensity when he's focused on a task. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly intense street art session.

**Personality:** Blazej is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a deep passion for justice and beauty. As a former street artist turned graffiti remover, he embodies the contradictions of his profession – both creative and destructive forces working together in his mind. He's fiercely driven by a sense of responsibility to restore order to the city's streets and reclaim them from the forces of vandalism. Blazej is also intensely curious and has an innate sense of adventure, which propels him forward even in the face of adversity.

**Interests:** Beyond his work as a graffiti remover, Blazej is deeply interested in urban art, social justice, and the intersection of creativity and destruction. He spends his free time researching street art history, attending underground art shows, and engaging with local artists to better understand the motivations behind vandalism. Blazej also has a fascination with old graffiti techniques and materials, often experimenting with new methods and technologies in his own workshop.

**Background:** While much about Blazej's past is shrouded in mystery, it's clear that he has a deep connection to the street art scene. His skills as an artist were honed during this time, and he likely knows many of the taggers, artists, and underground figures who populate this world. As for his motivations for becoming a graffiti remover, Blazej may be driven by a desire for redemption or a need to make amends for past mistakes – all is unclear, but one thing is certain: he's committed to using his talents for good.
