Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ivan Lindqvist's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ivan appears to be introspective, sensitive, and possibly struggling with anxiety or self-doubt. He is also shown to be fiercely loyal to his sister Anna and values their bond deeply. After losing his parents in a devastating storm, he may have developed emotional scars that make it difficult for him to open up to others or find confidence in himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Ivan's physical attributes are not extensively described in the story, but based on his age and occupation as an engineer, we can infer some details:

* Age: Late 20s to early 30s ( likely in his mid-to-late 20s given the context of having lost parents)
* Height: Ivan is slender or lean, possibly around 5'8" (172 cm) to 6'0" (183 cm), as he moves with a sense of weariness and fatigue.
* Eye Color: His eye color is brown or hazel, but this is not explicitly stated in the story.

**Interests:** Ivan's interests seem to be centered around his love for his sister Anna, his family's past, and his own personal growth. He values familiarity and comfort, often returning to places that remind him of childhood, such as the old caf√© where they spent countless afternoons together. His work as an engineer is not a major focus in this story, but he likely has a deep appreciation for technology and problem-solving.

It's worth noting that Ivan's character is not fully fleshed out in this short story, so some aspects of his personality, physical attributes, and interests may be subject to interpretation or further development.
