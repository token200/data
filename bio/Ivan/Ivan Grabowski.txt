Ivan also has a deep appreciation for art, particularly that which reflects the city's grittiness and resilience.

His evenings are often spent listening to the sounds of the city, observing its decay and rebirth with a quiet intensity that makes those around him feel seen and understood.

Overall, Ivan Grabowski is a complex, multifaceted individual whose rough exterior belies a profound inner wisdom and deep connection to the world around him.
