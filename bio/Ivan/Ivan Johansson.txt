Based on the short story provided as inspiration, here is a summary of Ivan Johansson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Ivan appears to be a introspective and enigmatic individual with a mysterious past. He has a tendency to keep people at arm's length, revealing only fragments of his true self to those he trusts. This could suggest that he is cautious or guarded when it comes to forming connections with others due to the uncertainty surrounding his identity.

However, as the story progresses, Ivan shows glimmers of vulnerability and hopefulness, particularly in his encounter with the young woman. This suggests that beneath his reserved exterior lies a complex and potentially deep-seated emotional life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Ivan is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) to 6'1" (185 cm), but this is not explicitly stated in the story.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not mentioned, so it's difficult to say what it is. However, considering his Scandinavian or Eastern European background hinted at by the surname "Johansson," a light-colored eye such as blue or gray could be fitting.

**Interests:**

While the story doesn't provide explicit details about Ivan's interests, we can infer that he has an affinity for Tokyo and its vibrant culture. He spends hours walking through the city, observing the crowds, and drinking coffee at a caf√©. This suggests that he may have an appreciation for urban landscapes, food, or artistic expressions.

Additionally, Ivan seems to be someone who enjoys solitude but values human connection. When he meets the young woman, his heart skips a beat, indicating that he is drawn to people and potentially seeking meaningful relationships in his life.

It's worth noting that Ivan's interests could also be connected to his past experiences and memories, which are slowly resurfacing as he navigates Tokyo. The tattoo on his left wrist and the whispered mention of his name by an old friend suggest a strong emotional connection to this city and its people.

Overall, Ivan appears to be a complex individual with a mix of introversion and openness, who is slowly unraveling the threads of his past to find himself in the present moment.
