In addition to his love of art, Ivan also enjoys reading literary classics, particularly the works of Dostoevsky.

Additional Details: It's worth noting that Ivan Boucher's full name, "Ivan Boucher", seems almost an afterthought, as if he'd only claimed it because it was his legal identity. This sense of disconnection from his own identity is reflected in his reserved nature and the way he keeps to himself.
