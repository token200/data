**Personality:** Ivan Harris is a skilled and resourceful intelligence agent with a reputation as one of the best in the world. He is likely a complex and multi-faceted individual, driven by a sense of duty and a need to uncover the truth. His years of experience as a Russian spy have given him a tough exterior, but there may be underlying emotions and vulnerabilities that he guards closely.

**Physical Attributes:** Ivan's physical attributes are not fully described in the short story, so I will make some educated guesses based on his occupation and personality:

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - this height suggests that Ivan is physically imposing, but not necessarily imposing enough to intimidate others.
* Eye Color: Piercing blue eyes with a sharp, intelligent glint. His eyes are likely expressive and seem to bore into those he meets, assessing their intentions and character.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, chiseled cheekbones, and a determined expression that suggests Ivan is a man who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to go after it.

**Interests:** Ivan's interests are not explicitly stated in the short story, but based on his occupation as an intelligence agent and his involvement with ancient cults, I would suggest that he has a fascination with:

* Espionage and covert operations
* Ancient history and mythology (particularly related to the Russian and Eastern European cultures)
* Cryptography and codes
* High-stakes missions and puzzles to solve
* The mysterious and unknown, with a particular interest in the supernatural and occult

Overall, Ivan Harris appears to be a sophisticated and highly skilled operative who is driven by a sense of duty and a need for challenge. His interests and personality suggest that he is intelligent, resourceful, and always on the lookout for the next exciting adventure.
