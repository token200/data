**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 5'8"
- Eye Color: Bright blue, with a hint of green around the iris
- Hair Color/Style: Long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall

**Personality:** 
Hailey is a free-spirited and creative individual who has always felt like an outsider. She is fiercely independent, confident, and unapologetic about her unique perspective on life. Despite her unconventional lifestyle, Hailey has a way of bringing people together through her art, which makes her warm and inviting.

**Interests:**

- Music (Hailey loves playing the guitar and singing)
- Connecting with others through her art
- Exploring different textures and colors in her work
- Nature and outdoor activities (such as hiking and camping)

In addition to these interests, Hailey is also passionate about social justice and equality. She believes that art should be a powerful tool for self-expression and social commentary, and she often incorporates themes of identity, community, and empowerment into her work.

As mentioned in the original story, Hailey's arrival at this point in her life was largely inspired by her rediscovery of her own identity as an artist and her renewed connection with her estranged father.
