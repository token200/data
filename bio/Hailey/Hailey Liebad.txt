**Personality:** Hailey Liebad is a creative and driven individual with a passion for photography. She has an eye for capturing the essence of her subjects, which is reflected in her work. Despite her success, she remains grounded and humble, never forgetting where she came from and always making time for her family.

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) or around, which would give her an advantage in capturing candid moments from a distance.
* Eye Color: Blue-green eyes, which are often associated with creativity and artistic expression.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, photography is Hailey's primary passion. She also seems to have a strong interest in human nature and the complexities of relationships, as evident in her decision to take on the high-profile wedding project despite initial reservations. Her experience with the bride's struggles as an artist suggests that she may also be interested in social justice and storytelling.

Overall, Hailey Liebad is a creative and empathetic individual who uses her photography to capture the essence of human experiences and relationships.
