Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Anton Szabo:

**Physical Attributes:**
Anton Szabo stands at 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build, allowing him to move stealthily and effortlessly through tight spaces. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, striking a balance between charm and intensity. His dark hair is often slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline that hints at a strong, determined face.

**Personality:**
Anton Szabo is a master manipulator, with an unnerving ability to read people and situations. He exudes confidence, using his charisma to distract and disorient those around him. Beneath the charming facade lies a calculating mind, always weighing risks and consequences before making his next move. Despite his reputation as a cunning thief, Anton Szabo seems to operate on a personal code of honor, leaving behind few loose ends or visible signs of his involvement.

**Interests:**
Anton Szabo's true passion is the art of thievery itself, with an affinity for high-stakes heists and intricate planning. He has an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows, making him a ghostly presence in Budapest's underworld. In his free time, Anton Szabo enjoys indulging in rare whiskey, playing the violin, and studying the works of Hungarian masters such as Frigyes Karinthy and Endre Ady.

As he navigates the cat-and-mouse game with Countess von Habsburg, it remains to be seen how Anton Szabo will balance his pursuit of justice (or revenge) against the thrill of outwitting his adversary.
