Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Anton Hall's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Anton Hall is a introspective and thoughtful individual who is deeply passionate about his work as a historian. Despite his impressive credentials, he feels suffocated by the weight of expectation placed upon him, which suggests that he may be sensitive to external pressure and has a tendency to internalize his emotions. He is also shown to be open-minded and receptive to new ideas, particularly when it comes to re-evaluating his approach to historical research.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair: Tangled and unkempt, possibly dark brown or auburn in color

**Interests:** As a historian, Anton's primary interest is uncovering the secrets of the past, particularly in regards to forgotten knowledge and half-forgotten tales. He is fascinated by the stories and narratives that have been lost over time, and he spends his life searching for them. His latest project, a biography on Leonidas, is a testament to his dedication to this pursuit.

It's worth noting that some details about Anton's physical appearance were not explicitly stated in the original story, so I've used my own interpretation to fill in the gaps. However, it seems likely that he would be a man of average build and demeanor, given the way he is described as feeling "suffocated" by expectation, rather than being overly confident or assertive.
