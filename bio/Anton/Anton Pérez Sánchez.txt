Anton's interests lie at the intersection of luxury, high-stakes adventure, and intellectual curiosity. He has a deep appreciation for art, history, and culture, which informs his choices as a thief.

He also has a fondness for fine dining, opera performances, and reading about history, philosophy, and psychology - subjects he finds fascinating and always looking to deepen his understanding of.

For him, there's no thrill quite like that which comes from successfully pulling off a daring heist or cleverly outsmarting an adversary. When time allows, Anton values solitude, preferring quiet evenings spent in contemplation over the chaotic excitement of his line of work.
