**Personality:**
Anton Corbero was once a driven individual with a sharp mind and a passion for architecture. However, after losing everything, including his family, friends, and identity, he now feels like a ghost haunting the streets of Madrid. He is introverted, introspective, and haunted by memories that weigh heavily on his mind.

Despite this, when he meets the young girl and begins to sketch with her, Anton Corbero experiences a renewed sense of purpose. He appears to be kind, gentle, and willing to help others, as evident in his offer to teach the girl about architecture.

Anton Corbero's interests seem to revolve around art, architecture, and rediscovering his lost identity. His experience with the young girl sparks a desire to learn more about architecture and share his knowledge with others. He is likely someone who values creativity, self-expression, and human connection.

It's worth noting that Anton Corbero's backstory suggests he may have had a successful career as an architect before losing everything. This could indicate that his interests in art and architecture are still present, but dormant due to the trauma of his past experiences.
