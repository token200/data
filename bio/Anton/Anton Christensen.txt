He is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to continue fighting for what he believes in.

His time as a spy for the resistance has also given him a keen analytical mind and an ability to remain adaptable in uncertain situations.

His hair is dark brown, often worn short and practical for his line of work. His eyes are an piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets.
