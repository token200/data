Here is a summary of Anton Nurlanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Anton Nurlanov is a complex and introspective individual with a troubled past. He is guarded at first, having spent decades keeping his emotions locked away in service to the KGB. However, as he opens up to Natalia, his true nature begins to emerge: kind, curious, and creative. Despite his tough exterior, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and longing for human connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Anton Nurlanov is a man in his late 50s or early 60s, with a slender build and an unassuming presence. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), which is slightly above average height. His eyes are a tired grey, a physical manifestation of the emotional toll he has endured over the years. His hair is graying, worn short, and often unkempt. He wears simple, practical clothing that allows him to blend into the background.

No longer driven by espionage or ambition, he has discovered a passion for art, particularly drawing and sketching.

With Natalia, he explores the city together, uncovering hidden corners and secrets left behind by the Soviet era.
