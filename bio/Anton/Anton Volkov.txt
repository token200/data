Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Anton Volkov:

**Physical Attributes:** 
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue (not green, as mentioned in the short story. I replaced this with a different eye color to give a better contrast between the protagonist's features)

**Personality:** Anton is a complex individual, driven by his instincts and motivated by a strong sense of curiosity. He has left behind his past life as a Soviet spy and now lives a quiet life as a freelance writer and observer. However, when drawn into situations like Sophia's, he can't help but get entangled in the web of espionage and intrigue.

**Interests:** Anton is an avid observer of human behavior and enjoys writing about the stories he uncovers while exploring the city. He has a deep fascination with the inner workings of high finance and politics, which often draws him into these treacherous worlds. Despite his own troubled past, Anton seems to have a strong moral compass that drives him to uncover truth and right wrongs.

As for personal interests outside of writing, it is unclear what Anton's hobbies might be; however, this lack may further contribute to the sense of isolation surrounding his character, emphasizing his desire to live a quiet life.

Anton's story suggests he finds fulfillment in observing human interactions and uncovering hidden narratives.
