Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Anton Webb:

**Personality:** Anton Webb is intelligent, curious, and determined. He has a passion for puzzles and codes, which drives him to continually push the boundaries of what is possible in cryptography. Despite his expertise and reputation as one of the world's top cryptographers, he remains humble and open to new ideas and collaborations.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small nose

**Interests:** Anton Webb is deeply passionate about cryptography, codes, and puzzles. He enjoys deciphering complex encryption methods and exploring new approaches to problem-solving. His interests also extend to sharing knowledge and collaborating with others who share his passion for innovation.

It appears that the original story does not provide information on Anton's physical attributes except for his height. To fill in this missing detail, I have added blue eye color, dark brown hair, a strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small nose to create a well-rounded character description.
