Here is a summary of the fictional character Anton Szyma≈Ñski:

**Physical Attributes:** Anton is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. His height is around 5'10" (178 cm), which was noted during the encounter with Kasia. His eye color appears to be a deep brown, a characteristic that suggests he has Polish heritage given his surname.

**Personality:** Anton seems to be introverted and guarded, having built walls around himself to protect from past traumas. However, as he spends time with Kasia, he begins to open up and share intimate details of his life. He is introspective and self-aware, often questioning his motivations and desires. Despite this introspection, Anton appears to have a dry sense of humor, as evidenced by his ability to navigate conversations about everyday topics like school and life.

**Interests:** Although specific interests are not mentioned in the story, it can be inferred that Anton has a deep love for literature (given Kasia's fondness for books) and possibly music or art. As he opens up to Kasia, it becomes clear that he values meaningful relationships and connections with others, which suggests an interest in human interaction.

**Other Details:** Anton appears to have a strong sense of nostalgia, having returned to his hometown of Krakow after many years abroad. He is haunted by memories of the past, particularly those related to his parents' death, and has been running from these emotions ever since. This emotional baggage makes him more cautious in relationships, but Kasia's presence helps him confront his demons.

Please note that some details, such as Anton's current occupation or hobbies, are not explicitly stated in the provided story and can be inferred based on context and character development.
