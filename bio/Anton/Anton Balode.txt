**Personality:** Anton appears to be a determined and driven individual, fueled by an inexplicable sense of urgency. He is also resourceful and sharp-witted, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues and connections. As a detective with the Latvian police, he has seen his fair share of cases and remains composed under pressure.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Anton's height is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on the description of him navigating the crowded market square and approaching an elderly woman, it can be inferred that he is likely around 5'10" to 6'2".
* Eye Color: His eye color is not mentioned in the story, but considering the cold winter setting and his focus on solving a murder case, it's possible that his eyes are blue or green, perhaps with a hint of grey.

He is deeply invested in his work, particularly when dealing with cases that have personal or societal implications.

However, the story hints at Anton's fascination with art and craftsmanship, as evidenced by his interest in Ivo VÄ“bergs' carvings and the wooden figurine sold by the street vendor. His attention to detail and curiosity about the artisan's work suggest that he may have an appreciation for creative expression and potentially even artistic talents of his own.

It's also possible that Anton has a personal stake or connection to the case, as hinted at by his inexplicable sense of urgency and determination to solve it.
