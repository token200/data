Here's a summary of the fictional character Anton Larsen:

**Physical Attributes:** Anton is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, with a lean and agile build that allows him to move quickly and effortlessly through crowded spaces. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender physique, suggesting he is well-trained in physical activities such as parkour or gymnastics. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his chiseled features and piercing eyes.

**Eye Color:** Anton's eye color is described as piercing, but unfortunately, the original text does not provide a specific color. However, based on the character's mysterious and cunning nature, it can be inferred that he has piercing blue or green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets, making them question his intentions.

**Personality:** Anton Larsen is a master manipulator with an air of confidence and charisma that borders on arrogance. He exudes a sense of self-assurance that allows him to talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation. This confidence is matched only by his cunning, as he expertly navigates the gray areas between right and wrong. Anton has an almost reckless abandon when it comes to taking risks, which fuels his passion for the art of deception.

**Interests:** As a master thief and con artist, Anton's interests are centered around understanding human psychology and exploiting vulnerabilities in people's behavior. He is fascinated by the art of manipulation and enjoys testing the limits of his own skills. Outside of his work, Anton seems to have little interest in material possessions or personal relationships, instead focusing on accumulating knowledge and experience that can aid him in his line of work.

**Hobbies:** Given Anton's background, it's likely that he has no hobbies per se, but rather a perpetual pursuit of learning and self-improvement. He may spend his free time studying human behavior, practicing new skills, or reading about psychology and criminology to stay ahead of the game.

In summary, Anton Larsen is an enigmatic figure with a troubled past, a keen intellect, and an uncanny ability to manipulate those around him. His charismatic presence belies a ruthless determination to succeed at any cost, making him both fascinating and intimidating to those who cross his path.
