**Personality:**
Sanjar is a confident and charismatic individual who exudes an air of superiority. He is fiercely intelligent and calculating, always weighing the risks and rewards of his actions. His reputation as a master thief has instilled in him a sense of invincibility, but this also creates an undercurrent of paranoia and anxiety that drives him to constantly question those around him.

Despite his arrogance, Sanjar has a strong sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect those he considers friends or allies. However, he is also aware that in his line of work, loyalty can be a luxury no one can afford, making it difficult for him to form lasting relationships or trust others completely.

He has a deep appreciation for rare artifacts and valuable collectibles, which often serve as the focus of his heists. When not planning or executing a heist, Sanjar enjoys indulging in the finer things in life, such as fine dining, expensive cars, and luxurious accommodations.

As someone who thrives on adrenaline and the rush of pulling off an impossible heist, Sanjar is also drawn to thrill-seeking activities like skydiving and high-speed driving. These pursuits allow him to channel his excess energy and satisfy his need for excitement outside of the confines of a heist.
