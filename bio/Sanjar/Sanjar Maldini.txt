* Eye Color: Piercing green

**Personality:**

* Enigmatic and mysterious, Sanjar is a master of deception and misdirection. She exudes an aura of confidence and intelligence that puts even the most seasoned opponents off guard.
* Despite her tough exterior, she has a dry sense of humor and enjoys playing cat-and-mouse with those who dare to challenge her.
* Sanjar is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to work alone rather than as part of a team. However, she will form temporary alliances when the situation demands it.
* Her ultimate goal is always the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of outsmarting her mark.

**Additional Notes:**

Sanjar Maldini is a master thief with an uncanny ability to blend in and manipulate those around her. Her reputation as "The Fox" precedes her, striking fear into the hearts of those who know her name. Despite her many successes, she remains enigmatic, always keeping her true intentions and motivations hidden beneath a veil of intrigue and mystery.
