Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Sanjar Wójcik:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with an intense sparkle that hints at his mysterious nature
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a messy, piecey fashion
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through you

**Personality:**

* Sanjar is enigmatic and introverted, preferring the company of shadows to people. However, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation calls for it.
* He is driven by a sense of restlessness and discontent with his mundane life as a baker. This feeling is rooted in a deep-seated desire for something more – a purpose that goes beyond his daily routine.
* Sanjar is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to achieve his goals.
* Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is willing to use his skills for the greater good (when the situation permits).

**Interests:**

* Sanjar's true passion lies in art – specifically, graffiti and urban art. He sees the city as his canvas and enjoys leaving subtle markings on its walls.
* Music is another one of his passions; he plays the accordion with a local band on weekends, using it as an outlet for his creative energy.
* Sanjar is fascinated by history, particularly the stories of Warsaw's past and the lives of those who came before him. He sees himself as a modern-day thief, navigating the hidden paths and secrets that lie beneath the city's surface.

**Additional Quirks:**

* Sanjar has an uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings, making him nearly invisible in crowded spaces.
* He is an avid collector of rare coins and tokens, often using them to barter with acquaintances or leave as gifts for those he trusts.
* Despite his love for thievery, Sanjar has a strong moral compass and only takes items that are lost or abandoned.
