Based on the provided short story, I will create a summary of the fictional character Sanjar Abdi:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sanjar Abdi is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. His exact height and age are not specified, but considering his agility and cunning nature, he might be lean and agile, possibly around 5'10" (178 cm) tall.

His eye color is described as "piercing," which suggests that they are likely an intense shade such as blue or green. However, the story doesn't explicitly mention his eye color, so this can be considered a speculative detail.

**Personality:**
Sanjar Abdi appears to be intelligent, resourceful, and stealthy, with an uncanny ability to evade detection. As a seasoned thief, he is confident in his skills and has honed them over the years through experience on the streets of Zerzura. His mysterious past and troubled childhood have likely shaped him into a self-reliant individual with a strong sense of survival instincts.

Despite his tough exterior, Sanjar Abdi seems to possess a sense of curiosity and wonder, as evident in his fascination with the Eye of Zerzura's secrets and potential power. This glimpse of vulnerability suggests that he may not be purely driven by selfish motives and might have a more complex personality than initially meets the eye.

**Interests:**
Sanjar Abdi's primary interest is likely thievery, specifically the pursuit of rare and valuable treasures like the Eye of Zerzura. However, as hinted at in the story, he may also be driven by a desire to unravel the secrets and mysteries surrounding ancient artifacts.

It's also possible that Sanjar has an interest in exploring hidden worlds or unlocking new knowledge, which is reinforced by his experience with the Eye of Zerzura. His encounters with the gemstone may awaken an inner curiosity about the nature of power, magic, and the world around him.

While we don't have much information on Sanjar Abdi's interests beyond thievery and mystery-solving, it seems that he has a deeper desire for discovery and understanding that goes beyond mere material gain.
