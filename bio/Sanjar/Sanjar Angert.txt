Here is a summary of Sanjar Angert's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sanjar Angert is a cunning and ruthless mercenary with a reputation as one of the most feared warriors in the land. He is intelligent and resourceful, able to think on his feet and adapt to any situation. Despite his tough exterior, he has a hint of pride and a tendency to take things personally, which can sometimes cloud his judgment. Sanjar is fiercely loyal to his crew, the Red Vipers, but has also shown a willingness to work with others when necessary.

**Physical Attributes:** Sanjar stands at an imposing 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build that speaks to his years of combat experience. His hair is dark brown and often messy, framing a face that is both rugged and handsome. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait that seems almost otherworldly in the midst of his rough-around-the-edges demeanor.

**Interests:** Sanjar's primary interest is protecting his crew and maintaining their position as one of the top gangs in the city. He is fiercely competitive and enjoys outmaneuvering his opponents, whether it's in a battle or a game of cat and mouse. When he's not fighting or strategizing, Sanjar seems to have little interest in anything else - although he may have a soft spot for whiskey and good company.

It's worth noting that while we don't have much information on Sanjar's personal life or motivations, his interactions with Lyra suggest that there may be more depth to him than initially meets the eye.
