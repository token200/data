**Physical Attributes:**
Julien is a petite woman with an athletic build. Her height is approximately 5'6" (168 cm), which may be underestimated due to her slender frame. Her eye color is an striking shade of indigo, almost purplish-blue, which seems to hint at the mysterious and unique nature of her abilities.

**Personality:**
Julien Björkqvist appears to be a fiercely independent individual with a strong sense of self-preservation. She's been forced to live on the run for years due to the notoriety surrounding her abilities, and as a result, she has developed a cautious and vigilant demeanor. Despite this, Julien shows resilience and determination in the face of adversity, refusing to back down from challenges.

However, there are hints that beneath her tough exterior lies a more vulnerable side. Her reaction to the bartender's words suggests that she may still be grappling with feelings of self-acceptance and belonging. Julien seems to be driven by a desire for safety and security, which is reflected in her efforts to keep her life hidden from the public eye.

**Interests:**
Given her extraordinary abilities and experiences, it's likely that Julien Björkqvist has an affinity for scientific inquiry, particularly in the fields of physics and neuroscience. Her knowledge of energy manipulation and matter may have led her to explore the theoretical aspects of her powers.

Additionally, Julien's background as a child with a rare neurological disorder suggests that she might be drawn to psychology or social sciences, helping others who are struggling with their own unique circumstances.

Outside of science-related pursuits, it's possible that Julien enjoys activities that allow her to stay physically fit and mobile. Given the outdoor setting of the bar, it's likely that she has an appreciation for nature and may enjoy hiking, rock climbing, or other wilderness activities.
