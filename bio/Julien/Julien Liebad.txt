His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing a face with sharp cheekbones and a pointed chin. His eyes are an intense shade of grey, almost blue, but with a hint of green that seems to sparkle when he's engaged in conversation. He has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose, adding to his rugged charm.

**Interests:** Julien has a deep passion for art, particularly drawing and sketching. In fact, he often finds solace in the process of creating, using pencil strokes that are both bold and expressive.

As someone who has experienced the highs and lows of life, Julien has developed a unique perspective on human nature and relationships.
