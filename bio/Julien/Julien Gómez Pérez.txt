Despite being shrouded in mystery, Julien has shown a capacity for empathy and a willingness to use his skills for good, often leaving gifts or returning stolen items to those he has helped.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)

**Interests:** Julien's interests seem to be centered around using his skills for good. He is particularly drawn to helping those in need, whether it be a young artist or an elderly woman struggling to reunite with her lost heirloom. He also appears to have a fascination with rare gemstones, which may hold sentimental value given the role they played in his transformation.
