**Physical Attributes:** Julien is a tall and slender man in his late 40s, with an unassuming appearance that belies his brilliant intellect. He stands at approximately 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Personality:** Julien is a complex and introspective individual, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of the universe. As a reclusive scientist, he has spent most of his life holed up in his laboratory, pouring over ancient texts and conducting experiments. Despite his isolation, Julien possesses a deep sense of purpose and conviction, which fuels his relentless pursuit of understanding The Echo.

**Interests:** Julien's primary interest lies in unraveling the mysteries of The Echo, a phenomenon that has consumed most of his waking hours.

He is also deeply interested in the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of all things.

**Habits:** Julien's habit of working tirelessly to unravel The Echo has led to a somewhat cluttered laboratory, replete with dusty papers, ancient texts, and half-finished experiments. His obsession with his work often leads him to neglect his personal life, but he seems to find solace in the silence and solitude of his laboratory.

**Goals:** Julien's ultimate goal is to harness the power of The Echo, using its energy to heal the rifts between timelines and mend the fractures in reality itself. He sees himself as a key player in a far greater game, one that spans the fabric of time itself.
