**Personality:** Julien is a complex and multi-faceted individual with a rich inner life. He has a troubled past, but his determination to break free from the cycle of uncertainty that defined him as a child drives him forward. Despite this, he remains fiercely independent and can come across as tough or guarded at times. However, beneath his exterior lies a kind and vulnerable soul, which Emma helps him to uncover.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, with hints of green
* Hair Color: Sandy blond, often styled in a messy, piecey look
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a strong jawline

**Interests:** Julien is passionate about technology, innovation, and social impact. He spends his free time reading about cutting-edge developments in the tech industry, attending networking events, and exploring new business ideas. Despite his love for work, he also values relaxation and self-care, often practicing yoga or meditation to unwind.

In his personal life, Julien enjoys trying new foods, traveling to new places, and practicing photography as a way to express himself creatively. He is deeply committed to social causes, particularly those related to education and family support, which stems from his own experiences in the foster care system.

As he navigates his relationships with Emma and others, Julien becomes increasingly interested in exploring themes of identity, community, and connection. He begins to see that his past doesn't define him, but rather serves as a foundation for the person he's becoming, and this realization sparks a sense of purpose and direction in his life.
