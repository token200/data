Here's a summary of Julien Jhih-hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Julien is a introspective and melancholic individual with a deep sense of self-awareness. He has a tendency to feel disconnected from others and the world around him, often struggling with feelings of abandonment and disconnection. Despite this, he possesses a quiet acceptance and resilience that allows him to navigate difficult emotions and find solace in solitude. Julien's introspective nature makes him more attuned to his own thoughts and emotions, and he has a strong sense of empathy for others who may be struggling.

**Physical Attributes:** Julien is tall, with an unspecified height (let's say around 6'1" or 185 cm). His eyes are an intense shade of indigo or blue, which seem to hold a deep sadness. His long black hair falls across his face when he's lost in thought, framing his sharp features and angular cheekbones. He has a slender build, which complements his introspective demeanor.

**Interests:** Julien appears to have a strong affinity for literature, art, and philosophy. He may be an avid reader of poetry, fiction, or non-fiction works that explore the human condition, existentialism, and the complexities of life. He might also appreciate music with melancholic undertones, such as classical or indie folk compositions.

Additionally, Julien seems to have a deep connection to nature, particularly when it's in a state of decay or transformation (as evidenced by his affinity for rain-soaked streets). This could suggest an interest in environmentalism, sustainability, or the symbolism of natural phenomena.
