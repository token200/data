* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and slightly messy, as if he's too focused on his work to bother with grooming.
* Skin Tone: Pale, almost porcelain-like complexion that speaks to his reclusive nature and sedentary lifestyle.

**Interests:** Julien Arjona is deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, particularly in regards to quantum physics. His research focuses on harnessing the power of quantum entanglement, which holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding of space-time itself. He spends most of his time lost in thought and contemplation, often forgetting about the world around him as he delves deeper into his work.

Additional details that flesh out Julien's character:

* He is a self-taught expert in quantum physics, having spent countless hours studying and experimenting on his own.
* Despite his reclusive nature, Julien has a deep love for the night sky and often spends hours gazing at stars on clear nights, searching for inspiration.
