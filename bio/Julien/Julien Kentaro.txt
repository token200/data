Despite his polished exterior, he has a rough past that he keeps hidden from the world, and this vulnerability gives him an edge in the high-stakes art dealing world.

**Other Details:** Julien has a distinctive tattoo on his left wrist, a symbol of his connection to Akira and their shared past. He carries himself with an air of quiet confidence, often dressed impeccably in tailored suits that reflect his love of high-end fashion. Despite his polished exterior, Julien's eyes betray a hint of wariness, as if he is always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
