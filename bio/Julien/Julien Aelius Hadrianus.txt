Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Julien Aelius Hadrianus:

**Personality:** Julien Aelius Hadrianus is a charismatic and ambitious individual who exudes quiet confidence. He has a strong sense of justice and is driven to make a name for himself in the Roman Senate. However, beneath his polished exterior lies a creative and introspective soul. As he delves into the world of poetry and performance, Julien reveals a more vulnerable side - one that is deeply connected to his emotions and desires.

**Physical Attributes:** Julien stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm) with piercing emerald green eyes that seem to gleam with intelligence behind his sharp features. His dark hair is often neatly trimmed, framing his heart-shaped face and chiseled cheekbones. He has a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of active pursuits.

**Interests:** At the core of Julien's being lies a passion for poetry. He devotes hours to studying the works of Virgil and Ovid, pouring over their lines with an unquenchable thirst for inspiration. His creative energy is contagious, and he finds himself lost in the rhythm of words when no one is watching. As he joins the traveling performers, Julien discovers a new love for storytelling, history, and mythology - themes that complement his own experiences as a statesman. He finds solace in the company of those who share their stories and live their lives with passion.

The experience also has a profound effect on him - he begins to question the rigid expectations placed upon him by society. As a poet-in-residence for the troupe, Julien is free to explore the depths of his own creativity, unencumbered by the constraints of politics. He starts to feel truly alive when he can express himself in all the ways that art and storytelling allow.
