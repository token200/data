Here's a summary of Julien Tóth's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Julien Tóth is an enigmatic and reclusive novelist with a troubled past. He wears a mask that hides his scars, but beneath it lies a complex and vulnerable individual who pours out his deepest fears and desires onto the page. Despite his success, he remains tight-lipped about his personal life, but those close to him see glimpses of a broken heart and a determination to create meaningful stories.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark blue, almost black, with an intense sparkle that hints at the depth of his emotions.
* Build: Lean and wiry, due to his fragile constitution and brittle bones. He often hunches over, as if burdened by the weight of his own thoughts.

**Interests:** Julien is passionate about writing, storytelling, and exploring the human condition through his work. His interests include:

* Writing (of course!), particularly in genres like literary fiction and historical fiction
* Reading (he's an avid reader, devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology)
* Music (he has a soft spot for classical music, particularly Chopin and Debussy)
* Travel (although he prefers to explore the world through his stories rather than visiting new places himself)
* Philosophy and Psychology (he finds inspiration in the works of existentialists, psychoanalysts, and philosophers like Nietzsche and Freud)

Despite his introverted nature, Julien has a deep sense of curiosity and wonder that drives him to explore the complexities of human experience. He is constantly seeking meaning and connection through his writing, which ultimately reflects his own tumultuous life.
