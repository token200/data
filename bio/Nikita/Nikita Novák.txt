Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Nikita Novák:

**Personality:** Nikita Novák is a sharp-witted and determined detective with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely intelligent and has an uncanny ability to think outside the box, making her a valuable asset in solving complex cases. Her quick wit and instincts serve her well in navigating the twists and turns of investigations, often allowing her to stay one step ahead of suspects. Despite her confidence and skill, she remains humble and committed to uncovering the truth.

**Physical Attributes:** Nikita Novák is a woman of average height (5'6" or 168 cm) with striking features that belie her reserved demeanor. Her eyes are an arresting shade of indigo, almost purple in color, which seem to bore into those she meets. Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a neat ponytail, revealing her heart-shaped face and high cheekbones. She has a petite nose and full lips that curve into a subtle smile when she's concentrating or finding a breakthrough.

**Interests:** Nikita Novák is an avid reader of history and philosophy, particularly the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and Carl Jung. She finds inspiration in their ideas on human psychology and behavior, often applying these concepts to her own investigations. Outside of work, she enjoys practicing yoga and exploring the winding streets of Prague's Old Town, where she can lose herself in the city's rich cultural heritage.

In terms of interests that are more specific to the Czech Republic, Nikita Novák has a deep appreciation for traditional Czech cuisine (such as svickova or goulash) and spends her free time sampling local beers at hidden taverns around the city.
