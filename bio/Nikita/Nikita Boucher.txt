Here's a summary of Nikita Boucher's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Nikita is described as fearless, unpredictable, and ruthless. She exudes confidence and a sense of self-assurance, bordering on arrogance. This confident exterior hides a sharp mind and a willingness to play psychological games with those around her. Her ability to read people and anticipate their moves makes her a formidable opponent.

**Physical Attributes:** Nikita is said to have piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets. However, no details are provided about her height, weight, or other physical characteristics beyond her eye color. It can be assumed that her stature may vary depending on the situation, as she is described as able to "weave through the crowd with ease."

**Interests:** Nikita appears to have a keen interest in high-stakes poker games and the power dynamics they represent. She is drawn to the game's exclusivity and the sense of control it offers her. Her presence at these events suggests that she is driven by a desire for intellectual competition, strategic thinking, and perhaps even revenge or retribution against those who have wronged her in the past.

**Additional Traits:** Nikita seems to be highly intelligent and resourceful, able to blend into different environments with ease (as rumored by some). Her uncanny ability to read people suggests that she has a strong intuition and is skilled at manipulating situations to her advantage. Despite her tough exterior, there may be moments where she flashes a rare smile or shows vulnerability, revealing glimpses of a more complex personality beneath the surface.

It's worth noting that these details are inferred based on limited information provided in the short story, and Nikita Boucher's full backstory and character traits might expand upon these characteristics.
