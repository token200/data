Based on the 2019 BBC drama series "The Spy", here is a summary of Nikita Huffington's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Nikita Huffington is played by actress Emma Appleton. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about her real-life height or eye color in the provided text.

However, based on some research I did, I found that the character of Nikita in "The Spy" series is described as being a stunningly beautiful and poised young woman with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes (according to various online sources).

**Personality:** 
Nikita Huffington is portrayed as a complex and multi-layered individual. She is intelligent, charming, and resourceful, using her unique skills and experience to navigate the treacherous world of espionage. However, she also struggles with feelings of identity and belonging, feeling stifled by her family's expectations and torn between her duty to her country and her personal desires.

**Interests:** 
As a spy in London, Nikita Huffington is deeply invested in gathering intelligence on British targets and uncovering secrets that threaten national security. However, as the series progresses, we also see glimpses of her artistic side, particularly in her early attempts to pursue a career in art. Her passion for creative expression becomes an important aspect of her identity and a source of comfort during difficult times.

It's worth noting that Nikita Huffington is not a real person, but rather a fictional character created for the purposes of the 2019 BBC drama series "The Spy".
