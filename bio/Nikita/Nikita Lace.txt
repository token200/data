Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Nikita Lace:

**Personality:** Nikita Lace is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, she exudes confidence and charm, using her quick wit and infectious laughter to draw people to her. However, beneath this glamorous facade lies a deeply troubled past, marked by pain, hurt, and betrayal. She is driven by a fierce determination to prove herself and outmaneuver those who have wronged her, particularly Alex. Despite this drive, she also has a softer side, revealing glimpses of vulnerability when least expected.

**Physical Attributes:** Nikita Lace stands at around 5'8" with an athletic yet curvy build. Her striking features include piercing emerald green eyes that seem to bore into those she meets, and long, raven-black hair that cascades down her back like a waterfall. Her skin is a warm, golden brown, suggesting a life spent outdoors and under the sun.

**Interests:** As an event planner, Nikita Lace has a passion for creating unforgettable experiences for her clients. She is detail-oriented and meticulous, with a keen eye for aesthetics and logistics. However, it appears that this side of her creative nature may be in conflict with her desire to seek revenge against Alex. This internal struggle suggests that she also has an interest in psychology and human behavior, particularly in the ways people manipulate and deceive each other.

It's worth noting that Nikita Lace's interests could extend beyond event planning and include activities such as meditation or yoga, which might help her manage her stress and emotions. Additionally, given her troubled past, she may be drawn to books or podcasts on psychology, trauma, or self-improvement.

In terms of hobbies, Nikita Lace may enjoy trying new foods and drinks, traveling to exotic destinations, or practicing art (e.g., painting or photography). However, these interests should also reflect her darker personality traits, such as a fascination with true crime or psychological thrillers.
