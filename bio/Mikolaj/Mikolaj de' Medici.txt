Here is a summary of Mikolaj de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mikolaj de' Medici is a complex individual with a deep sense of restlessness. He feels stifled by his predetermined role as a member of the wealthy Medici family and yearns for adventure, excitement, and freedom to express himself authentically. Despite his privileged upbringing, he is drawn to the common folk and seeks connection with them through his poetry. Mikolaj is also introspective and empathetic, able to see beyond the surface level of others and understand their desires and aspirations.

**Physical Attributes:** Mikolaj de' Medici stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build. His eyes are a piercing shade of blue, reminiscent of a clear Florentine sky. His dark hair is often styled neatly, but when he wears his hat adorned with a golden eagle, it frames his face and adds to his commanding presence.

**Interests:** Mikolaj de' Medici's true passion lies in poetry, which allows him to express the emotions and desires that he feels are suffocated by his family's expectations. He is drawn to the art world, particularly to artists like Leonardo da Vinci, who share his curiosity and creativity. In addition to politics, anatomy, and literature, Mikolaj has a keen interest in innovative machines and inventions, which sparks his imagination and fuels his sense of adventure.

It's worth noting that some details about Mikolaj's physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, so I had to fill in those gaps based on my understanding of the character.
