Here is a summary of Mikolaj Magi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mikolaj Magi stands at approximately 5'11" (180 cm) with a lean yet athletic build, honed from years of mastering stealth and deception. His long, dark hair falls to his shoulders, framing his chiseled face and piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark hair is often tousled, as if he's just rolled out of bed, adding to the air of mystery surrounding him.

**Personality:**
Mikolaj Magi appears to be a complex individual with an icy exterior that hides a multitude of emotions beneath. He exudes confidence and calmness, even in high-pressure situations, which has earned him his reputation as a master thief and assassin. However, glimpses into his past suggest that he may harbor a deep sense of vulnerability and melancholy, which surfaces occasionally when he's alone with his thoughts.

**Interests:**
Mikolaj Magi has a passion for music, particularly the mournful tunes played on his lute. He finds solace in playing and singing softly to himself on quiet nights, allowing him to express emotions he keeps hidden from the world. This hobby also serves as an outlet for his creative side, which is often suppressed by the demands of his profession.

In addition to music, Mikolaj Magi seems drawn to the thrill of the chase, the excitement of outsmarting his enemies and staying one step ahead of those who would seek to bring him down. This drive fuels his ambition and motivates him to push himself to new heights, making him an even more formidable figure in the underworld.

Despite his tough exterior, Mikolaj Magi appears to have a certain fondness for Ryker, the cunning thief who presented him with the proposal that set him on this path. The brief moment of warmth he showed towards Ryker suggests that there may be more to his nature than meets the eye.
