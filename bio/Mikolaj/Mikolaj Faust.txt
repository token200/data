**Physical Attributes:** Mikolaj Faust, known to his peers as Miko, stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an lean yet athletic build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, revealing an unyielding intensity that belies his youthful appearance. His dark brown hair is often unkempt and falls across his forehead in a messy swoop.

**Personality:** Mikolaj Faust is an ambitious and driven individual with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He is fiercely intelligent, always seeking to uncover the next great secret or unlock the mysteries of the universe. This drive can make him come across as aloof and somewhat cold, but beneath his reserved exterior lies a complex web of emotions and motivations that propel him forward.

**Interests:** Mikolaj Faust's interests are centered around alchemy, mysticism, and the dark arts. He spends countless hours studying ancient texts, experimenting with potions, and delving into the mysteries of life and death.

**Other Traits:** Mikolaj Faust is also deeply passionate about power and control. His desire for mastery over the forces of life and death becomes an all-consuming force that drives him to make increasingly reckless decisions.
