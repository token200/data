Here is a summary of Jake Nieminen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jake is a introspective and emotional person who has struggled to cope with the loss of his identity after retiring from professional hockey. He feels lost and uncertain about his future, which causes him to withdraw and isolate himself. Despite this, he is deeply grateful for his relationships with loved ones, particularly his best friend Mark, and values their support and encouragement. Jake is also fiercely independent and determined to find a way forward in life.

**Physical Attributes:** Jake is 6'2" tall, which was his typical height during his hockey playing days when he was known for his physical presence on the ice. He has dark brown eyes that often appear haunted or troubled due to the emotional weight of his experiences. His hair is short and sandy blond, which seems to fade away in his daily life as he loses touch with his former athletic self.

**Interests:** Before his injury, Jake's primary interests were hockey and physical fitness, which played a significant role in defining his identity. However, now that those pursuits are no longer possible for him, he finds solace in more low-key activities like watching TV or hanging out at home. Despite this, Jake is an avid reader of sports biographies, historical novels, or self-help books, which gives him hope and inspiration to find new paths forward.
