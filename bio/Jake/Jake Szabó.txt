**Physical Attributes:**
Jake Szabó is of Hungarian-Canadian descent and stands at 5'11" (180 cm) tall. His eye color is a deep brown that seems to bore into those he looks at, as if searching for answers.

**Personality:**
Jake Szabó is a driven and passionate individual who has dedicated his life to understanding the intricate relationship between human activity and the natural world. He is fiercely independent and intensely focused on his research, often to the point of neglecting his own well-being. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can come across as slightly wry or sarcastic, which serves as a defense mechanism against the weight of his responsibilities.

Jake Szabó's primary interest is environmental science, particularly in understanding the impact of human activity on local ecosystems. He is deeply interested in climate change and its effects on the planet. In his free time, he enjoys exploring nature and appreciates the beauty of the natural world – a contrast to the desolation he often feels when looking at the current state of the environment.

His parents, both scientists themselves, instilled in him a deep sense of responsibility to protect the planet. He has a strong sense of purpose and is driven to make a difference through his research.

**Quirks:**
Jake Szabó has a tendency to get lost in thought, especially when working on complex problems or reflecting on his childhood memories. He often feels overwhelmed by the scale of the environmental issues he is trying to address, but this sense of despair also fuels his determination to push forward with his research.
