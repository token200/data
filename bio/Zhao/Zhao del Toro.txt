Since you mentioned the fictional character Zhao del Toro doesn't exist, I'll create a new character inspired by the Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro.

Name: Zhang Yuan (Zhao del Toro is an anagram of Guillermo del Toro's name)

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of gold, reflecting his passion for storytelling and creativity

Personality:
Zhang Yuan is a visionary storyteller with a deep love for the mystical and unknown. He has an infectious enthusiasm for his projects, often getting lost in the world he's creating. His creative process is fueled by his curiosity about human nature, mythology, and the supernatural.

Interests:

1. Puppetry: Yuan has a lifelong fascination with puppetry and handcrafted props, which inspired him to explore the intersection of fantasy and reality.
2. Concept Art: He spends countless hours developing intricate concept sketches for his films, combining traditional techniques with modern digital tools.
3. Mythology: Yuan draws heavily from various mythologies worldwide, incorporating elements that fascinate him into his storytelling process.

As Zhang Yuan delves deeper into his craft, he embodies the same passion and dedication that made Guillermo del Toro a master of dark fantasy.
