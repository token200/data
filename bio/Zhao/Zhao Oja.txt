Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Zhao Oja:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing amber-colored eyes, reminiscent of the golden hue of desert sand
* Hair Color and Style: Short, dark brown hair, often tied in a simple ponytail, revealing his determined expression

**Personality:**
Zhao Oja is an unwavering individual with a strong sense of justice. His unrelenting spirit has been forged through hardship and adversity, making him an unyielding force on the battlefield. Despite being driven by a desire for protection, he remains empathetic towards those in need, often putting the well-being of his family above personal ambitions.

Zhao Oja's humility is tempered by his undeniable prowess in combat, which has earned him both respect and fear from his peers. His calm demeanor during intense battles belies an unyielding ferocity when provoked, making him a formidable opponent for those who dare to oppose him.

**Interests:**

* Martial Arts: Zhao Oja's passion for martial arts is unmatched, as he continually seeks to hone his skills under the guidance of his mentor, Master Li.
* Strategy and Tactics: His dedication to martial arts extends beyond combat itself; he meticulously studies tactics and strategies, often analyzing victories and defeats to improve his techniques.
* Family and Protection: Zhao Oja's unwavering commitment to protecting those he cares for drives many of his actions. He will go to great lengths to ensure the safety of his loved ones.

While lacking a wealth of personal possessions or material wealth, Zhao Oja finds solace in the simple things â€“ a well-crafted sword, an elegant horse, and the serene beauty of nature. His unwavering dedication to martial arts serves as both a source of strength and spiritual guidance for him, allowing him to navigate life's challenges with equanimity.
