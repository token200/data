Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Zhao Mel:

Zhao Mel, or Zhao Mel (not to be confused with Mei-Ling) appears to be a female doctor with an unconventional approach to medicine. Unfortunately, there isn't much information available about this person.

One possible attribute of Zhao Mel could be her height and eye color. Assuming she is of the same ethnicity as the main character, Zhao Mei-Ling, it's likely that Zhao Mel has Asian features, which might include a petite stature (around 5'2-5'4) and dark eyes such as brown or black.

Her personality could be described as fiercely independent, confident, and passionate about her work. Like Mei-Ling, she may be drawn to unorthodox approaches and is not afraid to challenge traditional norms in order to push the boundaries of what is possible in medicine.

As for interests, Zhao Mel might share similar passions with Mei-Ling, such as studying the healing properties of plants and herbs, or perhaps exploring other unconventional methods of treatment. She may be a seeker of knowledge and truth, always looking for new ways to improve her craft and help others.
