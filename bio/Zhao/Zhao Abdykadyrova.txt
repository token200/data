Here is a summary of Zhao Abdykadyrova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Zha is a confident and ambitious individual with a passion for the world of high-stakes art forgery. She has a natural talent for creating convincing fakes and crafting complex narratives, but this confidence often comes across as arrogance. As she grew older, her ego began to get the better of her, leading her to take on more elaborate schemes that put her at risk of being caught. Despite this, Zha is fiercely determined and driven, willing to push herself to new heights in pursuit of perfection.

**Physical Attributes:** Zha stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem almost dark brown due to the thick eyeliner she often wears. Her hair is usually styled in a sleek, low ponytail that frames her heart-shaped face and accentuates her sharp jawline.

**Interests:** Zha's primary interest is art forgery, particularly in creating convincing fakes of high-end art pieces. She also has a deep passion for fashion, enjoying the way designers can create an entire persona with just one garment. In her free time, she loves to experiment with textiles and patterns, often sketching out intricate designs in her notebooks.

It's worth noting that Zha seems to be quite enigmatic, almost mysterious, despite being described as having a close relationship with Viktor. This air of mystery makes it difficult to pin down exactly what drives her passions or interests, but she appears to be driven by both artistic expression and the thrill of deception that comes with creating forgeries.
