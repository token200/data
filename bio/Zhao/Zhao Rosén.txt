Since there is no existing information on Zhao Rosén, I'll create a fictional character profile for you. Here's a summary of Zhao Rosén:

**Physical Attributes:** Zhao Rosén is a 5'9" (175 cm) tall individual with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and often styled in a messy, spiky manner. His eyes are a striking feature - they're a deep shade of indigo, almost purple, which can be both captivating and intimidating to those who meet him.

**Personality:** Zhao Rosén is a complex individual with a rich inner life. He's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo and pushing boundaries. Despite this, he has a soft spot for underdogs and marginalized groups, which motivates his actions. He can come across as aloof or standoffish at first, but once you gain his trust, he's fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

**Interests:** Zhao Rosén is deeply passionate about art, music, and literature. He's a talented painter and musician, often expressing himself through abstract expressionism and experimental electronic music. He's also an avid reader, devouring books on philosophy, history, and science fiction. In his free time, he enjoys exploring abandoned buildings, attending underground art exhibitions, and engaging in heated debates about social justice and politics.
