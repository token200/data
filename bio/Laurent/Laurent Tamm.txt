Despite his struggles, Laurent has a strong sense of determination and resilience, which drives him to create music that is honest and authentic.

He loves vinyl records, rare books on art history, and experimental cooking techniques (he's particularly fond of Korean BBQ). Laurent also has a deep appreciation for poetry, which he finds inspiring for its ability to capture the human experience in a few well-crafted lines. When he's not performing or writing music, you can find him playing guitar or practicing yoga to calm his mind and soothe his soul.
