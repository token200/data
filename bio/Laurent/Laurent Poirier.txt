Here is a summary of Laurent Poirier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Laurent has a tough exterior due to his difficult past, which makes it challenging for others to get close to him. Despite this, he has a deep passion for art that consumes his life and drives him to create something beautiful. He is introverted and often lost in his own world, but as he opens up to those around him, particularly his father, he shows signs of emotional vulnerability.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, which contrasts with the dark colors that dominate his painting style
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and wiry, due to years of living on the streets

**Interests:** Laurent's primary interest is in art, specifically painting. He spends most of his days locked away in his studio, experimenting with different techniques and styles. He is deeply passionate about capturing emotions and experiences through his work, which often leads him to explore themes of loneliness, family, and self-discovery.

In addition to art, Laurent shows a growing interest in understanding the people around him, particularly those who care for him, like his father. This newfound appreciation for human connection may be a result of his recent reunion with Philippe, and he begins to see the value in nurturing relationships beyond his artistic pursuits.
