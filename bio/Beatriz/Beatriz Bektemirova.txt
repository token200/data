**Personality:** Beatriz is a complex and enigmatic individual with a rich history. As a former Soviet spy, she has been trained to be a master of deception and manipulation, making her a skilled operative who can think on her feet. However, after years of living in the shadows, she has become increasingly disillusioned with the world around her, leading to a sense of emotional numbness and detachment. Despite this, Beatriz possesses a strong sense of justice and a desire for purpose, which drives her actions as a freelance journalist and later as an investigator.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)

**Interests:** Beatriz's interests are varied and driven by her desire for purpose and justice. As a former spy, she has expertise in:

1. Investigative Journalism: using her skills of observation and interrogation to uncover hidden truths.
