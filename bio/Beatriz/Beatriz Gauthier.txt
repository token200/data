Here's a summary of Beatriz Gauthier's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Beatriz is known for her rebellious spirit and unapologetic attitude towards life. She has a sharp wit and quick tongue, which can be intimidating to those who don't know her, but she is also kind and willing to lend a listening ear or offer sage advice to her friends and colleagues. She is driven by a desire to use her voice to make a difference and has a strong sense of justice.

**Physical Attributes:** Beatriz is likely to be in her mid-to-late 30s, with a tall and athletic build, perhaps around 5'10" (178 cm) in height. Her hair could be dark brown or black, possibly styled in a way that frames her face and accentuates her bold features. Her eyes are likely to be piercing green or hazel, which seem to sparkle with intensity when she's on the story of a lifetime.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Beatriz has a deep passion for uncovering truth and sharing it with the world. She is fiercely curious and loves nothing more than digging into complex stories and exposing corruption. Outside of work, she may enjoy activities that allow her to stay active and engaged, such as rock climbing, hiking, or attending live music events. She is likely to be a voracious reader and has an interest in politics, social justice, and current events.

It's worth noting that Beatriz seems to have a strong connection with the activist group she works with, particularly Maya, who serves as a kind of inspiration and mentor for her reporting style. This suggests that Beatriz may also have interests in social activism, community organizing, or philanthropy outside of her work as a journalist.
