Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Arseniy de' Medici's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Arseniy appears to be a creative and passionate individual, driven by his love for art and dedication to his craft. He is also kind-hearted, as evidenced by his connection with Sophia, whom he fell in love with. Additionally, he seems to possess an entrepreneurial spirit, as seen when he accepts the commission from Giovanni de' Medici, which sets him on a path of establishing himself in the art world.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: Arseniy is likely around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, a height that would have been common among artists during the Renaissance period.
- Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly stated, but based on his association with Leonardo da Vinci and the era in which he lived, it's plausible that he had dark brown or hazel eyes, which were also common during this time.

Interests:
- Art: As an artist himself, Arseniy's primary interest is in honing his craft and creating beautiful works of art. His work with Leonardo da Vinci would have instilled in him a deep respect for artistic technique and innovation.
- Philosophy: He also appears to be interested in philosophical discussions, as evidenced by the conversations he has with Sophia about various topics.
- Observation: Arseniy is described as spending hours observing human forms and studying light and shadow. This suggests that he might have an interest in portraiture or still-life painting.

It's worth noting that since this character is fictional and based on a real historical figure (Leonardo da Vinci was not mentioned in the story, but I inferred it for context), some artistic liberties were taken to fit Arseniy into the world of Renaissance Florence.
