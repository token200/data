Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Arseniy Gorski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arseniy is an enigmatic individual with a complex and mysterious nature. He is described as a master of disguise, able to blend into any crowd and adopt the mannerisms and speech patterns of those around him. This ability makes him an asset to those who know him, but also a liability for those who don't. Despite his ghostly presence, Arseniy has a certain allure to him, which is hinted at by his disarming smile.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story does not provide detailed information about Arseniy's physical appearance beyond his eye color. However, it can be inferred that he is a relatively tall individual, as he is described sitting at a table in a caf√© without mentioning any difficulties with seating or stature. Furthermore, his striking green eyes are likely to be an expressive and piercing feature of his face.

**Interests:** Based on the narrative, Arseniy's interests seem to lie in observing people and situations from a distance, rather than actively engaging in them. He appears to be fascinated by human behavior and emotions, as evident from his watching the young woman write in her notebook. Additionally, his past experiences as a former spy or brilliant hacker suggest that he may have an interest in technology, espionage, or other clandestine activities.

Some additional details can be added to flesh out Arseniy's character:

* Age: Late 30s to early 40s
* Height: Around 6'1" (185 cm) - tall enough to stand out without drawing attention
* Eye Color: Green, with a piercing intensity that seems to see right through to the soul

Please note that these details are speculative and not explicitly stated in the original story.
