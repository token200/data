Here's a summary of Arseniy Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arseniy Olsen is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, he appears to be a rugged and stoic private investigator with a no-nonsense attitude. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a deeply troubled soul with emotional scars from his past experiences as a KGB agent. He has a dark and brooding nature that draws people in like moths to a flame, but this also makes him prone to self-destructive tendencies. Olsen is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to work alone rather than rely on others for support.

**Physical Attributes:** Arseniy Olsen stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are an piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets as if searching for secrets. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his sharp features. He has a distinctive scar above his left eyebrow, which hints at the physical and emotional trauma he has endured in the past.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Olsen's interests are largely centered around solving complex mysteries and uncovering hidden truths. He is intensely curious and loves to dig deep into the darkest corners of human nature, often finding himself drawn to cases involving crime, corruption, or social inequality. In his free time, Olsen enjoys long walks in the Moscow wilderness, whiskey-soaked introspection, and solitary piano playing - which serves as a therapeutic outlet for his emotional pain.

It's worth noting that Olsen's troubled past has left him with little room for hobbies or leisure activities that might be considered 'normal'. His focus is always on the next case, and when he finally finds redemption at the end of Anastasia's investigation, it marks a significant turning point in his life.
