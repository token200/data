Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Arseniy Nagy's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Arseniys is of slender build, with an unremarkable height of around 5'9" (175 cm). His striking features include pale alabaster skin and eyes that seem to absorb light, giving him an unsettling appearance in the dark. He has unkempt brown hair and a sharp jawline.

**Personality:**
Arseniys is a complex individual with a mix of traits. On one hand, he exhibits quiet confidence, calculating precision, and an air of detachment. This stems from his years on the streets of Moscow, where he honed his survival skills to navigate the shadows. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a man driven by simple desires: bread (food), vodka (liquor), and revenge against those who have wronged him.

**Interests:**
Arseniys' primary interests revolve around his goal of taking down Viktor Kuznetsov's crime empire. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, often using his skills to stay one step ahead of the law and potential threats. Arseniy also seems to appreciate the thrill of outsmarting others and bringing those who wrong him to justice.

It can be inferred that his fascination with revenge against Kuznetsov stems from a past personal tragedy or injustice suffered by him, driving his motivations throughout the story. His actions are guided by a strong sense of determination, even if it means walking the fine line between good and evil in the dark underworld of Moscow.
