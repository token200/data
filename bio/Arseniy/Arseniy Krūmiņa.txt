Arseniļ is a complex individual shrouded in mystery, as hinted at by his penchant for the macabre in art. He is both introverted and introspective, often lost in his own thoughts as he navigates the world of art and human connections. Despite this, he has an innate ability to understand and empathize with those who share similar passions and perspectives.

**Interests:**
Arseniļ's artistic endeavors are driven by a deep fascination with the darker aspects of life, the unknown, and the supernatural. His artwork often explores eerie landscapes, skeletal figures, and otherworldly themes that tap into the collective unconscious.
