**Personality:** Arseniy is a complex and introspective individual. He has a deep sense of discontent and feels like an outsider in society due to his family's tragic fate, which his name seems to mock. However, he also has a raw emotional intensity that allows him to tap into powerful emotions through music. Despite this, he struggles with feelings of inadequacy and shame stemming from his name, which can hold him back at times.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a sharp, almost brooding intensity that seems to bore into those he meets
* Hair: Dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in disheveled locks

**Interests:** Music is Arseniy's true passion. He has an innate ability to express himself through sound, which allows him to connect with others on a deep level. Playing the guitar is not just a hobby for him but a means of survival and self-expression. He also appreciates the underground music scene and feels most at home in crowded, dimly lit clubs where he can lose himself in the rhythms.

Overall, Arseniy Claudius Nero is a multifaceted individual with a rich emotional landscape. His unique name may haunt him, but it is his talent for music that truly sets him free.
