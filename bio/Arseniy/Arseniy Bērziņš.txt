Based on the short story, I have created a fictional character profile for Arseniy Bērziņš:

**Name:** Arseniy Bērziņš
**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s (though his exact age is not specified in the story)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - slightly above average height, which might contribute to his reserved nature as he often stands out in a crowd.
* Eye Color: Deep, rich brown eyes that seem to hold a world of emotions within them. His eyes are often cast downward, betraying his introverted personality.

**Personality:** Arseniy is an enigmatic and quiet individual who keeps to himself. He is reserved and cautious, preferring the comfort of solitude over social interactions. Despite this, he has a deep passion for painting that sets him apart from others. His creative energy is intense, and when lost in his art, he becomes completely absorbed in the process.

**Interests:**

* Painting: Arseniy's primary interest is painting, which serves as an escape from the monotony of his daily life as an accountant.
* Colors and textures: He has a deep fascination with colors and textures, often experimenting with different techniques and mediums to achieve unique effects.
* Music: Although not explicitly mentioned in the story, it can be inferred that Arseniy enjoys music, perhaps even creating soundscapes or scores for his artwork.

**Additional Traits:** Arseniy's introverted nature might make him appear aloof or distant at first glance. However, beneath this exterior lies a sensitive and creative soul who is deeply moved by the world around him. His art serves as an extension of himself, reflecting his unique perspective on life.

Please feel free to modify any aspect of this character profile if you'd like me to adjust anything!
