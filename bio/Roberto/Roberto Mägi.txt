**Physical Attributes:**

* Confidence Level: High
* Risk Tolerance: Extremely high (although tempered by recent self-reflection)
* Emotional Intelligence: Growing awareness and empathy for others

Roberto's early years as "El Fuego" were marked by recklessness and a desire to push limits. However, after hitting rock bottom and reconnecting with his roots, he has shown a significant growth in emotional intelligence and empathy. He now approaches the sport with a sense of purpose and humility.

It's worth noting that Roberto's great-grandfather's adventurous spirit seems to have had a lasting impact on him, influencing his approach to the sport and his values off the track.
