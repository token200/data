I must clarify that since you're referring to the film "I'm Sorry, But I Don't Believe in Love" by Roberto Almodóvar (also known as "Te Doy la Vida" which translates to "I Give You Life"), I will not be referencing a real person.

That being said, assuming this is a fictional character, here's a summary of their personality, physical attributes, and interests:
