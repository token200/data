**Personality:**
Roberto Jankowska is an enigmatic figure known for his reserved and gruff demeanor. He comes across as introverted and isolated, preferring to spend time alone lost in thought. However, beneath this exterior lies a depth of intellectual curiosity and a passion for mathematics that drives him to make groundbreaking contributions. As he opens up to Sarah and her colleagues, his personality reveals itself to be sharp-witted, introspective, and increasingly enthusiastic about sharing his ideas.

**Physical Attributes:**
Roberto Jankowska is approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall, with a slender build that belies his intellectual intensity.
