**Physical Attributes:** Ingemar stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an unassuming build. His hair is graying at the temples, and he has piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at.

Despite his fame within the scientific community, he is reclusive and prefers to keep a low profile. He can come across as gruff or dismissive to those outside his field, but once you gain his trust, he opens up and reveals a dry sense of humor and a passion for discovery.

**Interests:** Ingemar's primary interest is in quantum mechanics, which has consumed his life's work. He is fascinated by the intricacies of the universe and spends most of his time studying and experimenting with complex theories and devices. In his free time (which he rarely has), he enjoys tinkering with gadgets and machinery, often creating new devices that push the boundaries of scientific understanding.
