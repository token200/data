**Physical Attributes:**
Ingemar Woźniak stands at an unremarkable height of 5'9" (175 cm) with a slender build. His eyes are a piercing shade of indigo, almost black in color, which seems to hold an otherworldly intensity when focused on his work.

**Personality:**
Ingemar Woźniak is portrayed as a brilliant and reclusive scientist who is intensely focused on his work. He appears detached and observant, as if studying himself through a different lens, particularly during the intense scrutiny of being in the spotlight after revealing Chronos to the world. While some see him as a hero, others fear the implications of his discovery, indicating that he may have an unsettling or unyielding presence.

**Interests:**
Ingemar Woźniak is consumed by an insatiable curiosity for knowledge and the manipulation of time itself. He has spent countless hours in his makeshift laboratory tinkering with gadgets, machinery, and theories related to time travel and its potential applications. His work on Chronos represents a culmination of this obsessive pursuit, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.

His interests extend beyond scientific inquiry, however; he seems drawn into otherworldly realms and appears to have an uncanny connection with forces beyond human comprehension.
