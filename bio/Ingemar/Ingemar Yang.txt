Here's a summary of Ingemar Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ingemar Yang is a determined and persistent private investigator with a dry sense of humor. He can be self-deprecating, often making light of his own frustrations and shortcomings. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for his colleagues and friends, particularly Rachel Lee, whom he values for her sharp mind and unwavering support.

**Physical Attributes:** Ingemar is likely in his mid-to-late 30s, with a lean build that allows him to move easily through the city. He stands around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet wiry physique developed from years of physical activity. His eyes are a piercing blue, fringed with thick lashes that seem almost unfairly long for his angular face. His hair is dark brown and messy, often sticking up in every direction as if he's been running his hands through it all day.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Ingemar has a keen interest in solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. He's intensely curious, always looking to learn more about people and situations that pique his attention. Outside of work, he enjoys reading mystery novels and devouring true crime stories, which often fuel his own investigative instincts. When not working or reading, Ingemar likes to unwind with a good cup of tea and a worn leather-bound book, lost in the pages for hours on end.

It's worth noting that Ingemar has a bit of an identity crisis surrounding his full name, "Ingemar Yang." He seems to prefer being called by his nickname or simply "Yang" when possible, suggesting a desire to shed the weight of his given name and forge his own path.
