Dmytro is intensely curious and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to take on high-stakes missions that test his skills and push him to the limit.

Despite his rough exterior, Dmytro has a deep emotional core and is haunted by the traumas of his past. He's fiercely protective of those around him and will stop at nothing to defend them from harm. As he navigates the dark world of espionage, Dmytro must confront his own demons in order to emerge victorious and come out on top.
