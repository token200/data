He has piercing emerald green eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity and a mop of unruly dark brown hair that always seems to be slightly messy. His skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours outdoors.

**Personality:**
Dmytro is an adventurous soul with a free-spirited personality that often gets him into trouble. He's fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. However, he also has a compassionate side that makes him a loyal friend and a devoted protector of those he cares about. Dmytro is intensely curious and loves to learn new things, often finding himself fascinated by obscure subjects and hidden knowledge.

**Interests:**
Dmytro's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting his adventurous personality. He's an avid rock climber, an accomplished pianist, and a passionate writer. He loves exploring abandoned buildings, reading ancient texts, and listening to folk music.

**Additional Traits:**
Dmytro has a small tattoo of a stylized owl on his left shoulder blade, which he got during his travels. He's a bit of a thrill-seeker and loves taking risks, but he's also fiercely responsible and will always try to find a way out of trouble before putting himself or others in harm's way.
