Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Sasha Szymanski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sasha appears to be introverted and slightly anxious, as evident from her fidgeting fingers at the counter in the coffee shop. However, she also shows resilience and hopefulness, as seen when she receives the handwritten note and begins to feel a sense of belonging. She is likely creative and open-minded, given her desire to escape the stress of her corporate job and start anew.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** Sasha's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on her ability to stand out amidst the quaint town of Willow Creek, it can be assumed that she is probably around 5'6" to 5'8", which is above average for a woman.
* **Eye Color:** Although her eye color is not specified in the story, brown eyes are often associated with the Polish heritage mentioned later in the text (as "Szymanski" is likely of Polish descent). Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that Sasha has brown eyes.

**Interests:** Sasha appears to value peace and contentment, as evident from her desire to escape the stress of her corporate job and find a new sense of belonging. She also seems to appreciate nature, given her decision to take a stroll along the nearby river and enjoy the sounds of the town blending together in a soothing melody. Her creative side is hinted at by her willingness to try out a new life and explore the possibilities of Willow Creek.
