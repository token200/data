In addition to her physical attributes, Sasha's interests are shaped by her upbringing as the daughter of diplomats. Her travels have taken her to many countries, exposing her to diverse customs, art forms, and philosophical perspectives. As a result, she is passionate about exploring new ideas, meeting people from different backgrounds, and incorporating their stories into her own work.

As for any missing details, I assumed that Sasha's parents would be supportive of her artistic endeavors, given the story's focus on their family gathering in rural Poland. I also imagined that Sasha might have a small studio or workspace within the estate where she can paint and express herself creatively.

Lastly, considering Sasha's love for art and travel, I pictured her having a few tattoos that reflect her experiences and cultural connections. Perhaps a small Polish flag on her left ankle, a snake coiled around her right wrist (representing her connection to Africa), or a vibrant mural-inspired tattoo on her upper back (a representation of her passion for street art).
