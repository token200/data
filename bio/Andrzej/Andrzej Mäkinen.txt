Here's a summary of the fictional character Andrzej Mäkinen:

Physical Attributes:
Andrzej Mäkinen is a tall and imposing figure, standing at around 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) with a strong build that speaks to his wrestling background. His dark hair is always neatly styled, and his piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets. He has a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rugged charm.

Personality:
Andrzej is a no-nonsense individual with a strong sense of justice. As a former wrestler turned private investigator, he has developed a tough exterior that hides a compassionate heart. His years of experience have taught him how to remain calm under pressure and navigate the complex web of human relationships. Andrzej is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority when he feels it's necessary.

Interests:
When not working on cases or digging through financial records, Andrzej enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking in the Tatra Mountains or simply taking a walk along the Vistula River. He's an avid reader, particularly fond of history and politics, which serves him well in his line of work. Andrzej is also a bit of a solitary figure, content to spend evenings alone with a good book or watching an old wrestling match on TV.

Other details:
Andrzej has a distinctive way of speaking, often using Polish colloquialisms and slang that adds to his charm. He's not afraid to use humor to defuse tense situations or keep clients at ease. Despite his tough exterior, Andrzej has a soft spot for those in need, particularly women and children, which drives him to take on cases that others might overlook.
