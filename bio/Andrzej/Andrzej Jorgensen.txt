He is haunted by his troubled past, which has instilled in him a deep-seated sense of restlessness. Despite this, he possesses a curious and introspective nature, often tuning out the world around him to listen to the whispers of his own thoughts. This introspection allows him to navigate unfamiliar situations with ease, but also makes him vulnerable to the darker aspects of human experience.
