Based on the inspiration from Gabriele d'Annunzio and the short story, I've created a fictional character profile for Andrzej D'Annunzio:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, reminiscent of a clear summer sky
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and flowing like a poet's mane
* Facial Features: Chiseled jawline, high cheekbones, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile

**Personality:**

Andrzej is a free-spirited Polish poet and patriot with a passion for life. He embodies the essence of d'Annunzio's romanticism, often seen as reckless and unapologetic in his pursuit of pleasure and freedom. Andrzej has an irrepressible sense of humor and can charm his way out of (or into) just about any situation. His sharp wit and quick intellect make him a compelling conversationalist, but also lead to occasional conflicts with those who value prudence over passion.

**Interests:**

* Poetry: Andrzej is deeply inspired by d'Annunzio's sensual and passionate style, which he strives to emulate in his own work.
* Music: He has an affinity for Italian opera and classical music, often finding solace in the sounds of Puccini or Verdi.
* Art: Andrzej appreciates the works of the Old Masters, particularly Caravaggio, who shares his love for drama and emotional depth.
* Travel: The Adriatic coast holds a special place in Andrzej's heart, and he spends as much time exploring its secrets as possible.
* Philosophy: He is deeply interested in existentialism, phenomenology, and other philosophical movements that explore the human condition.

**Quirks:**

Andrzej has a habit of carrying a small notebook with him wherever he goes, jotting down lines of verse or observations about life. He often uses Italian phrases and expressions, much to the amusement (or annoyance) of his Polish friends. When deeply moved, Andrzej's eyes tend to take on an ethereal quality, as if lost in thought and connected to something greater than himself.

Keep in mind that this is a fictional character inspired by Gabriele d'Annunzio, and not meant to be a direct representation of the Italian poet or politician.
