Here is a summary of the fictional character Andrzej Sikora:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Age: Late 30s
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue, with a piercing quality that seems to bore into those he meets
- Hair: Dark brown, often disheveled and sticking out in every direction

**Personality:**
Andrzej is a driven and intelligent individual with an insatiable curiosity about the past. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as slightly awkward or rough around the edges to those who don't know him. As a history buff, he is passionate about uncovering hidden truths and piecing together seemingly unrelated fragments of information.

**Interests:**
Andrzej is deeply interested in Polish history, particularly the medieval period. He spends most of his free time studying old texts, attending historical reenactments, and exploring the city's lesser-known corners. As an amateur detective, he enjoys solving puzzles and following leads to uncover new discoveries. His fascination with Jadwiga and her legend drives him to pursue a life of discovery, always seeking answers to questions that have haunted him for years.

**Other Details:**
Andrzej has a worn leather wallet that contains various notes, maps, and mementos from his historical research. He often wears a faded blue coat over a crisp white shirt, with a pair of well-worn trousers tucked into scuffed boots. A silver pocket watch dangles from his chain, a gift from an old mentor who had instilled in him a love for history. Andrzej's eyes light up when discussing his latest discoveries or theories, and he has a tendency to get lost in thought when pondering the intricacies of Poland's past.
