Here is a summary of Andrzej Pawlak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Andrzej Pawlak is a driven and determined individual, fueled by guilt and grief over the tragic events at the Polish Army barracks ten years ago. He is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth and bringing justice to those responsible for Marek's disappearance. His personal experiences have made him a deeply empathetic person, but also someone who is not afraid to confront harsh realities or take action against those he believes are guilty.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Grey-Brown (thin and slightly receding)
* Build: Slightly slender, with a wiry physique honed from years of physical labor as an Army officer.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing brown eyes that seem to bore into those he interrogates.

**Interests:** As a former Polish Army officer turned detective, Pawlak's interests revolve around justice, truth, and the preservation of national security. He is meticulous in his work and has a keen analytical mind, which serves him well in piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. On a personal level, he finds solace in reading about history and the lives of those who served in previous wars.

Outside of his professional duties, Pawlak enjoys drinking coffee (especially cold brew) and sipping whiskey at his local pub, where he often strikes up conversations with fellow patrons about politics, sports, or current events. He is not one for frills or luxuries but values quiet evenings with a good book, his thoughts consumed by the puzzles and enigmas that continue to haunt him.

Pawlak's deep-seated passion for justice fuels his work as a detective, making him an exceptional investigator with a unique ability to unravel even the most complex cases.
