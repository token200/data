* Build: Lean and athletic, indicating a lifetime of physical activity and mental focus.

**Interests:** Andrzej Schulz's interests lie primarily in the theoretical aspects of cryptography, particularly the concept of the "golden ratio" and its applications in creating unbreakable codes. He is fascinated by the mathematical proportions that underlie these codes, which he sees as a reflection of his own personality - simple yet elegant.

He is also drawn to the study of ancient cryptography methods and their potential applications in modern times. This fascination stems from his desire to understand the art of cryptography on a fundamental level, rather than simply using it for personal gain or recognition.

In addition to his work, Andrzej Schulz seems to appreciate solitude and quiet contemplation, often seeking out isolated settings where he can focus on his thoughts and ideas without distraction.
