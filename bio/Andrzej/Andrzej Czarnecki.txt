As a retired historian, he has spent years pouring over dusty documents and researching Poland's tumultuous past, which has instilled in him a sense of quiet desperation and determination. Despite his passion for history, he struggles with feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt, particularly when it comes to uncovering the truth about his family's role in Poland's complex history. He is also intensely private and private, often preferring to share his findings through tales and anecdotes rather than revealing personal details.

**Interests:** Andrzej's primary interest is in Polish history, particularly the 19th and early 20th centuries. He is an avid researcher and collector of rare documents and artifacts, and spends most of his days pouring over dusty tomes and yellowed papers.
