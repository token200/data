Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aleksander Cook's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksander Cook is a complex and mysterious individual. On the surface, he appears to be a humble carpenter, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep-seated history of trauma and loss. As a former spy and assassin, he has been conditioned to be vigilant and perpetually on guard, making it difficult for him to let his emotions show. However, when interacting with Emma, Aleksander displays a sense of vulnerability and openness that suggests a deeper desire for human connection. He is likely introspective and self-aware, grappling with the remnants of his past and struggling to reconcile his old identity with his new life.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Age: 50
* Height: Approximately 6 feet (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, possibly a result of his Eastern European or Russian heritage

**Interests:** Aleksander's interests are diverse and influenced by his past experiences. As a carpenter, he is skilled with his hands and takes pride in creating something from scratch. He seems to appreciate the physicality of manual labor and finds solace in working with wood. In addition to woodworking, Aleksander appears to enjoy spending time outdoors, possibly due to his former life as an operative.

Given his background as a spy and assassin, Aleksander likely has interests related to espionage, surveillance, and tactical training. However, these aspects are not explicitly mentioned in the story, and it is unclear if he still engages with such activities or if they have become an integral part of his past rather than his present.

It's also worth noting that Aleksander seems to be a man of few material possessions, living a simple life in rural America. He may have a fondness for quiet, secluded spots, and his workshop could serve as a sanctuary where he can escape the stressors of his daily life.
