Here's a summary of Aleksander Välja's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksander Välja is an enigmatic and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. He possesses an air of authority and confidence that commands respect, yet his piercing blue eyes also convey a deep sense of empathy and understanding. As a recluse, he has developed a unique perspective on the world, allowing him to navigate the boundaries between reality and the unknown.

**Physical Attributes:** Aleksander Välja stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet wiry build. His piercing blue eyes seem to see right through you, as mentioned in the short story. His dark hair is usually unkempt, framing his angular face and emphasizing his strong jawline. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many forays into the unknown.

**Interests:** Aleksander Välja's fascination with the supernatural began at a young age, leading him to become an expert in occultism, demonology, and the arcane arts. His interests include:

* Studying ancient mythology and folklore
* Exploring the mysteries of the natural world (e.g., astrology, alchemy)
* Mastering dark magic and talismanic spellcraft
* Collecting rare and obscure texts on the supernatural
* Meditating and communing with the spirits to better understand the cosmos

In his remote cabin, he has created an elaborate system of symbols, talismans, and ritual spaces, which serve as a focal point for his practices. His work is deeply personal, driven by a desire to comprehend the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality.

Despite his reputation as a recluse, Aleksander Välja seems to be drawn to the company of others who share his curiosity about the unknown. He has a soft spot for those seeking knowledge and understanding, which may explain why he takes Liina under his wing in the short story.
