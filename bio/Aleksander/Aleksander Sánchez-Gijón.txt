Here is a summary of Aleksander Sánchez-Gijón's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksander is a creative and introspective individual with a restless spirit. He is driven by his passion for art and music, and is not afraid to take risks or challenge conventions. His experiences growing up as the son of a Spanish diplomat and Mexican artist have instilled in him a strong sense of cultural identity and a desire to explore the intersections of different artistic traditions. Aleksander is fiercely independent and values his autonomy, but he is also deeply collaborative and trusts his partner in creativity, Luna, implicitly.

**Physical Attributes:** Aleksander stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his artistic intensity. His eyes are a deep, rich brown that seem to sparkle with creativity when he's working on a new project. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got in a childhood accident involving a broken guitar string.

**Interests:** Aleksander is passionate about painting, music (specifically, traditional Spanish guitar playing), and textile art. He loves exploring the intersections of different artistic traditions and incorporating found objects and textiles into his work. He is also interested in multimedia installation and performance art, and sees his new project as a way to merge these different disciplines in innovative ways.

In terms of hobbies or interests outside of art, Aleksander enjoys reading about philosophy and politics, particularly in the context of cultural identity and social justice. He is also an avid coffee drinker and smoker, often using these vices as a source of inspiration and creative fuel.
