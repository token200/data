Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Aleksander GÃ³rski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksander is portrayed as a skilled and confident individual with an air of mystery surrounding his past. He appears to be a master thief with exceptional skills in creating forgeries that are almost indistinguishable from the real thing. His ability to remain calm under pressure and think on his feet is evident, as he quickly swaps the painting with a forgery and escapes without getting caught. This suggests that Aleksander is intelligent, resourceful, and possibly a bit of a thrill-seeker.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific details about Aleksander's physical appearance are mentioned in the story. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that he likely has an average to above-average height (around 5'9" or 175 cm). His eye color is not specified, but given his ability to blend into the shadows and avoid detection, it's possible that he has dark or expressive eyes.

**Interests:** As an artist and thief, Aleksander appears to have a fascination with art, forgery, and deception. He likely enjoys the thrill of outsmarting others and staying one step ahead of security measures. His profession requires him to be highly observant, analytical, and skilled in manipulation, suggesting that he may also have interests in psychology, sociology, or criminology. Additionally, his ability to appreciate and understand art suggests a level of cultural sophistication and refinement.

It's worth noting that the story provides limited insight into Aleksander's personal life, motivations, or emotional state, so these attributes are largely inferred based on his actions and behavior as presented in the narrative.
