Here's a summary of Aleksander Isakova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aleksander Isakova is a quiet and introspective person who prefers to keep to himself. He is fiercely independent and has a tendency to be self-sufficient, which can make him appear aloof or distant to those who don't know him. However, beneath his tough exterior lies a heart of gold and a deep kindness that he only reveals to those he trusts. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about, particularly children like Lily.

**Physical Attributes:** Aleksander Isakova stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic build honed from years of physical labor. His dark hair is always neatly tied back in a ponytail, revealing a face etched with lines and creases from hard work and dedication. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he looks at, as if sizing them up before making a judgment. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got during a particularly grueling repair job.

**Interests:** Aleksander Isakova is deeply passionate about mechanics and machinery. He spends most of his free time tinkering with engines and repairing broken devices in his small workshop. Despite his love for machinery, he also has a soft spot for old bicycles, and his fondness for Lily's family bike is evident from the way he took such care to repair it.

Additionally, Aleksander Isakova seems to have a fascination with trains, which could be hinted at by the fact that his workshop is located near an old railway track. He may spend hours watching trains rumble by, lost in thought and contemplation. Despite this interest, he is not a social butterfly and prefers to keep to himself, preferring the company of machinery and tools over people.

Overall, Aleksander Isakova is a complex and multifaceted individual with a rich inner life that he only reveals to those closest to him.
