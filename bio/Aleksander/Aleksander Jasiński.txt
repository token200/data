**Personality:** Aleksander appears to be a introspective and emotional person. He has a strong connection to his past and his family, which has driven him away from his art and towards a sense of wanderlust. However, upon returning home, he is able to open up and connect with those around him, particularly his niece, on a deep level. This suggests that Aleksander may be more empathetic and understanding than initially meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - The story does not provide an exact measurement of Aleksander's height, but based on the description of him stepping off the train and onto the worn platform, it can be inferred that he is a tall man.
* Eye Color: Brown - Although the color of his eyes is not explicitly mentioned in the story, brown is a common eye color associated with many Eastern European cultures, which is consistent with Aleksander's Polish heritage.

**Interests:** Aleksander's interest appears to lie in art, as his parents encouraged his love of art from a young age. However, he has pursued a different path in life, leaving behind his artistic ambitions. His return home and reconnection with his family suggests that he may have found new meaning or purpose in life through the relationships he had with those closest to him.

Additionally, Aleksander's interest in reconnecting with his past and finding a sense of belonging suggests that he values tradition, heritage, and community. He is also shown to be a romantic at heart, as evidenced by his emotional reunion with his niece and his desire for family and connection.
