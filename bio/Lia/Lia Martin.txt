**Personality:** Lia Martin is a complex and dynamic individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, she appears confident, charismatic, and resourceful, traits that served her well as a skilled thief. However, beneath this exterior lies a deeply guarded and introspective person, haunted by past mistakes and struggling to trust others. As she navigates her new role as an agent of the law, Lia reveals herself to be fiercely determined, fiercely loyal, and fiercely intelligent, using her wit and cunning to outsmart her adversaries.

**Physical Attributes:** Lia Martin is a striking woman with an athletic build, standing at 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean yet toned physique honed from years of street life. Her eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, which seem to bore into those she meets, and her dark hair is often pulled back in a sleek ponytail, revealing a smattering of tattoos on her neck and shoulders that reflect her troubled past.

**Interests:** Despite her tough exterior, Lia has a soft spot for art, music, and literature. In her free time, she enjoys sketching the cityscapes of New Haven, collecting rare books and vinyl records, and attending underground poetry readings. Her love of art serves as a creative outlet, allowing her to channel her emotions and express herself in ways that were previously stifled by her life as a thief.
