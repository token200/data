Here's a summary of Lia Corbero's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lia Corbero is known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but she also has a soft spot for stray animals. She is compassionate, dedicated, and tireless in her work as a veterinarian. Her kind heart and gentle nature have earned her many admirers, particularly among the animals themselves.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Eye Color: Bright blue

These physical attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the original story, but I've added them to flesh out Lia's character. The bright blue eyes suggest a sparkling and engaging personality, while the 5'8" height gives her a presence that commands attention without being overwhelming.

**Interests:** Lia Corbero is deeply passionate about animal welfare and has dedicated her life to helping animals in need. She is particularly drawn to strays and underdogs, and her work as a veterinarian allows her to make a tangible difference in the lives of creatures great and small. Her love for animals is matched only by her love for their humans, as evidenced by her dedication to helping families find the perfect companion animal.

Additional details that complete Lia's character:

* Hobbies: Lia enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and photography, all of which allow her to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty.
* Goals: Lia hopes to one day establish a sanctuary or rehabilitation center for injured wildlife, where she can provide a safe haven for animals in need.
* Quirks: Lia has a habit of talking to animals as if they were people, much to the amusement of her colleagues at the shelter. She is also a bit of a hopeless romantic, always believing that every animal has a special story to tell and a love waiting to be found.
