Here's a summary of Lia James' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Lia is a complex and introspective individual, haunted by past cases that continue to weigh on her mind. She has a strong sense of determination and drive, which propels her forward even in the face of uncertainty and doubt. Her years as a private investigator have given her a tough exterior, but she also possesses a deep empathy for those who are suffering. Despite this, Lia struggles with feelings of guilt and inadequacy, stemming from cases where she couldn't find closure for the families involved.

**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Hazel (with flecks of golden brown that seem to darken when she's deep in thought)

Lia has an understated sense of style, often dressing in layers to conceal her tattoos and piercings. She favors functional clothing suitable for her line of work, such as leather jackets, dark jeans, and comfortable boots.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Lia is naturally drawn to the darker corners of human nature and the mysteries that lie within. Her interests include:

- Forensic science
- Criminology
- Psychology
- Mystery novels (especially those with a noir or detective twist)
- Hiking and walking in the city at night

Lia's love for the rain-soaked streets may be an oddity, but she finds solace in their desolation. Her affinity for the stormy weather might make her more inclined to observe life in the shadows rather than bask in the spotlight.

Despite her profession being rooted in darkness and despair, Lia has a deep affection for poetry and songwriting as creative outlets that help her process her emotions.
