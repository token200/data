* **Height:** Approximately 5'8" (173 cm)
* **Eye Color:** Pale blue or gray, which contrasts with her dark hair and pale face
* **Hair:** Long, black, and straight, falling around her pale face like a curtain

**Interests:** The story doesn't explicitly state Lia's interests, but based on the context of her actions and emotions, some inferences can be made:

* She appears to enjoy people-watching and observing others, particularly in bars and other social settings (e.g., when she scans the crowd for someone who understands her).
