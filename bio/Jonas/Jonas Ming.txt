Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Jonas Ming's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Jonas Ming appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. He is willing to spend hours searching for a specific café, which suggests that he is persistent and driven. When he finally finds the café, his demeanor changes, and he becomes more relaxed, as evidenced by his shiver down his spine when seeing the sign above the door. This reaction implies that Jonas has a strong emotional connection to the café or its owner, Ming, which may indicate that he has a personal stake in finding the hacker.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** Unspecified
- **Eye Color:** Not mentioned in the story

Unfortunately, there is no information provided about Jonas' physical appearance beyond his eyes. However, we can infer that he is likely a male individual based on the context of the story and the character's actions.

**Interests:**
The story does not explicitly state Jonas' interests, but it can be inferred that he is interested in finding a hacker who specializes in hacking or computer-related fields. His determination to find this person suggests that he has a specific goal in mind, possibly related to his own work or personal projects.

Additionally, Jonas seems to appreciate the atmosphere and offerings of Ming's Brews, as evidenced by his positive reaction when entering the café for the first time. This appreciation might indicate that he values community, social connections, or simply enjoys coffee, which could be an interest beyond his primary goal of finding the hacker.

Keep in mind that these inferences are based on a limited and relatively short story, and more context would be needed to gain a deeper understanding of Jonas Ming's personality, interests, and life beyond this specific scenario.
