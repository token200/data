Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Jonas Angert:

**Physical Attributes:** Jonas stands at around 5'11" (180 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look endearingly disheveled. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a depth of emotion when he looks at someone. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, which adds a touch of ruggedness to his features.

**Personality:** Jonas is introspective and thoughtful, often lost in his own thoughts and worries. He has a tendency to overthink things and is plagued by self-doubt and anxiety, particularly when it comes to his future and responsibilities. Despite this, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, such as Emily, and will do whatever it takes to protect and support them. He is also deeply empathetic and can easily put himself in others' shoes, which makes him an excellent listener.

**Interests:** Jonas has a deep love for the ocean and the lighthouse, having spent countless hours exploring its nooks and crannies as a child. He is fascinated by history, particularly the stories of lighthouse keepers and their struggles to maintain the light amidst treacherous weather conditions. When not lost in thought or worrying about his future, Jonas enjoys hiking, reading (especially classics and philosophy), and playing guitar.
