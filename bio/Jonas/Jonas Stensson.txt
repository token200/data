As for any missing details, I've added a few: Jonas has a small tattoo of a wrench on his left bicep, which he got during a particularly memorable road trip with friends. He is also an avid reader of classic car magazines and attends car shows whenever he can. When not working on cars, Jonas enjoys taking long walks along the Swedish countryside, where he grew up.
