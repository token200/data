Here is a summary of Dev Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Dev is determined, passionate, and fiercely dedicated to exposing the truth. He has a strong sense of justice and a deep connection to his community, which motivates him to fight for what he believes in. He is also driven by a desire for attention and recognition, but this fuels his fire rather than consuming him.

**Physical Attributes:** Dev is likely in his mid-to-late 20s or early 30s. He stands around 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with a lean build that suggests he spends a lot of time on his feet. His eye color is a deep brown, which seems to bore into those he interviews as if searching for the truth.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Dev's interests are centered around investigative reporting and storytelling. He is particularly passionate about exposing corruption and shedding light on long-forgotten issues that affect his community. In addition to his work, it appears that Dev is also interested in local music festivals (implied by the mention of Rachel discussing an upcoming festival).
