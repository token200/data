I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Dev Muti". However, based on your request, I'm assuming you might be referring to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's character.

If that's the case, here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6 feet 5 inches (196 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue

Personality:
Dev Muti is a charismatic and confident individual. He has a strong sense of justice and is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. As a skilled warrior, he possesses exceptional courage and determination.

Interests:
As a demigod from Greek mythology, Dev Muti has a deep interest in martial arts and combat sports. He also enjoys collecting rare artifacts and reading ancient texts about his ancestors' history.

Additionally, as the character of "The Rock", Dwayne Johnson brings his own personality traits to the table, including:

* A strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness towards those he cares about
