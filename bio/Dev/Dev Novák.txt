Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Dev Nov√°k:

**Personality:** Dev is an introverted and creative individual who has struggled to find his voice as a painter. He feels overwhelmed by pressure and expectations from others, particularly his parents, who were also artists. Despite this, he has a deep desire to create something meaningful and authentic. After meeting Viktor Kozlov, Dev begins to feel a sense of purpose and courage, suggesting that he may be more resilient and open to new experiences than initially thought.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Jet black
* Build: Lean and athletic

Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much detail about Dev's physical appearance beyond his height. We can imagine him as a tall and lean figure with dark eyes that reflect his introspective nature.

**Interests:**

* Painting (particularly abstract expressionism)
* Music ( possibly jazz or classical)
* Reading ( likely literature or philosophy)

Based on the story, it seems that Dev's interests are closely tied to his passion for art. He is drawn to music and reading as a way to escape into other worlds and spark new ideas. As he begins to find his voice as an artist, these interests may become more central to his life.

It's worth noting that these details are inferred from the story, and there may be additional aspects of Dev's personality, physical attributes, or interests that are not explicitly mentioned.
