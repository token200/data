Here's a summary of Dev Borromeo's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Dev is a confident and capable leader, evident in his ability to command respect from his crew. He exudes an air of authority and is always "on high alert," indicating a strong sense of responsibility and duty. Despite this, he also seems to have a lighter side, as evidenced by his playful interactions with his crewmates and the fact that he can laugh off a ruckus in their presence.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Dev is likely around 6'1" or 6'2", tall enough to stand out on the deck of the ship but not so towering that it becomes intimidating.
* Eye Color: His eyes are dark brown, possibly almost black, as described by the "salty air whipping through his dark hair."
* Hair: Dev's hair is dark and likely shoulder-length or longer, blowing freely in the wind as he works on the dock.

**Interests:** As the son of a captain and having grown up watching him navigate the Hudson River, Dev has developed a deep love for the water. He takes pride in his role as captain and finds satisfaction in guiding his ship through the harbor and beyond. His interests seem to focus primarily on maritime activities, such as sailing, navigation, and cargo management.

Dev also seems to appreciate his crew's camaraderie and social lives outside of work, as evidenced by his willingness to participate in their revelry at the dock's bar and playfully reprimanding one of them for being too rowdy. This sense of balance between professional duty and personal enjoyment suggests that Dev values relationships with his team members beyond mere authority figures.
