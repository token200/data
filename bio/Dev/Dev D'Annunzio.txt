**Personality:**
Dev D'Annunzio is a complex and introspective individual. On the surface, he presents himself as confident and charismatic, but beneath lies a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity. As a member of the powerful D'Annunzio family, Dev has always felt the weight of legacy and expectations.

Despite this, Dev is fiercely intelligent and passionate about history, driven by a desire to understand his family's past and forge his own path. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but he is deeply empathetic and will go to great lengths to support those he cares about.

- History, particularly Italian and Mediterranean history
- Opera (Dev's grandmother Sophia was an opera singer, and he often attends performances when possible)
- Reading and learning about the D'Annunzio family's stories and experiences
- Traveling and exploring new places, with a particular affinity for Italy and its countryside

**Additional Traits:**
- Dev has a deep love of Italian culture, music, and art
- He is fiercely independent but will occasionally seek guidance from those he trusts (like Sophia)
- Despite his family's expectations, Dev values honesty and authenticity above all else
