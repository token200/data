Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Fran√ßois Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Drusus is an enigmatic figure shrouded in mystery. He possesses an uncanny ability to navigate the shadows, suggesting that he is resourceful, clever, and possibly even stealthy. His skills as a master thief and forger imply that he is charismatic, confident, and able to think on his feet. However, the fact that he receives mysterious messages and proposition offers from unknown parties suggests that he may also be cautious, calculating, and driven by self-preservation.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no specific details about Drusus's physical appearance in the short story. However, based on the description of his black coat with a crimson lining and intricate embroidery, it can be inferred that he values elegance, sophistication, and possibly even a touch of luxury. The emblem on his coat - a serpent devouring its own tail - suggests that he may have an affinity for mysterious, symbolic motifs.

As for height, eye color, and other physical attributes, let us assume the following:

* Height: Drusus stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), which is slightly above average height for a man of his era.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a piercing green, reflecting his cunning and perceptive nature.
* Hair Color: His hair is dark brown, possibly with hints of black, adding to his enigmatic persona.

**Interests:** Drusus's interests seem to revolve around his skills as a thief, forger, and con artist. He is drawn to the thrill of the unknown, the rush of adrenaline that comes with pulling off daring heists, and the challenge of outsmarting those who seek to deceive him. His involvement with The Patron and the gemstone suggests that he may also have an interest in rare artifacts, precious objects, and perhaps even the supernatural or mystical aspects of his work.

Additionally, Drusus seems to value freedom and independence, as evidenced by his reluctance to take on jobs that require him to operate under close supervision. He appears to be a lone wolf, preferring to work alone rather than as part of a team.
