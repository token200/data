His eyes are a warm, hazel brown that seem to sparkle with creativity whenever he's engaged in music. His hair is dark brown, often styled neatly but with a hint of messy undertones, suggesting a free-spirited individual.

He is deeply interested in researching and learning about the history behind traditional melodies and lyrics, often spending hours pouring over dusty tomes or speaking with elderly villagers. His love for classical music also runs deep, and he has a particular fondness for the works of Chopin, Debussy, and other Romantic-era composers. When not making music, François enjoys exploring the great outdoors, hiking through Latvian forests, and immersing himself in nature to find inspiration for his next composition.

François is also an avid learner and continues to expand his knowledge on various subjects, including linguistics (Latgalian and Lithuanian being particular favorites), folk traditions, and music history. His interests extend beyond the world of music as well; he's a voracious reader, devouring books on philosophy, psychology, and literature whenever time allows.
