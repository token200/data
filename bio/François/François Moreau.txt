Here is a summary of François Moreau's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** François Moreau is a complex and enigmatic individual. On the surface, he appears to be a quiet and unassuming wine merchant, but beneath this façade lies a man with a rich history as a former spy. He is guarded and secretive, having spent years working for the French government, gathering intelligence and conducting clandestine operations behind enemy lines. This experience has left him with a sense of vulnerability and a need for control, which he attempts to satisfy through his work in the wine trade. Despite this, François is drawn to Sophie's mysterious nature and is eager to uncover her secrets.

**Physical Attributes:** François Moreau stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with an athletic build that speaks to his past life as a spy. His hair is dark brown, often worn neatly trimmed, and his eyes are piercing green, a unique feature that seems to hold a deep intensity. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his missions. François's style is understated yet refined, reflecting his appreciation for fine wine and classic elegance.

**Interests:** In addition to his work in the wine trade, François has a deep love for history, particularly the Napoleonic Wars and French espionage. He is an avid collector of rare books and documents related to these topics, which he keeps hidden away in his estate's library. When not working or indulging in his hobbies, François enjoys taking long walks through the countryside, observing the changing seasons and reflecting on his past experiences. He is also a skilled horseman and has a fondness for classical music, particularly Chopin.
