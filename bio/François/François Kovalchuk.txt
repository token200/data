Here is a summary of François Kovalchuk's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Hair: Dark brown, often styled to accentuate his chiseled features
- Build: Lean and athletic, with a strong physique honed from years of living on the streets

**Personality:**
- Charming and charismatic, with an effortless ability to talk his way into (and out of) most situations
- Cunning and manipulative, with a talent for reading people and exploiting their weaknesses
- Complex and multifaceted, with a deep-seated desire to be seen and understood beyond his surface-level persona

**Interests:**
- High-stakes scheming and cons, often targeting wealthy individuals or organizations
- Improvisational theater and performance art, which allows him to showcase his charm and charisma in a more creative way
- Philosophy and psychology, particularly as it relates to human nature and the complexities of relationships
- Music, specifically jazz and blues, which provides an outlet for his emotional depth and complexity

It's worth noting that François's interests are largely secondary to his primary goal of manipulating others and getting what he wants. However, as he begins to develop feelings for Colette, he starts to explore these interests in a more meaningful way, seeking out deeper connections and a sense of authenticity beyond the surface-level facade of his con artist persona.
