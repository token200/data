Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Nicolas Loren's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Nicolas Loren is a man of mystery with an air of quiet confidence. He commands attention without speaking much, which suggests he has a strong presence and can convey power without needing to assert himself verbally. Despite his tough exterior, Nicolas has a soft spot for those in need, indicating that he has a compassionate side and will go out of his way to help those who cannot help themselves.

**Physical Attributes:** The story doesn't provide an exact height, but it describes Nicolas's piercing green eyes as "seeing right through you," suggesting they are unusually intense. There is no mention of eye color being green in the provided text, however, so I have made this assumption for the purposes of this summary.

Nicolas's physical attributes aside from his eye color are not specified in detail within the given short story.
