Personality:
Nicolas Liebad is a complex and intriguing individual. He is initially perceived as a recluse, shrouded in mystery, with few knowing his true identity. This aura of secrecy suggests that he has experienced significant trauma or pain in the past, leading him to withdraw from the world. However, upon meeting Sophie, it becomes clear that this persona is not entirely authentic, and beneath the surface lies a brilliant mind with a passion for mathematics and an insatiable curiosity.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: Nicolas Liebad stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), indicating he has a slender yet athletic build.
- Eye Color: His eye color appears to be dark brown or nearly black, giving him a reserved and intense appearance.

Interests:
Nicolas's primary interest lies in the field of chaos theory. He is an expert mathematician who had become increasingly obsessed with unlocking its secrets. This focus on mathematics has led him down paths of isolation and self-reliance but also holds the key to understanding complex problems, as illustrated by his partnership with Sophie.

Additional details about Nicolas Liebad include:

- Appearance: His features suggest a man in his late 30s or early 40s who may have grown increasingly disheveled due to his reclusive lifestyle.
- Lifestyle: Living in an old castle on the outskirts of Paris suggests a life far removed from conventional societal norms, adding to his enigmatic persona.
- Interests outside mathematics: Given his past as a mathematician struggling for recognition and his passion project in chaos theory, it's possible that he finds solace in reading dusty tomes and exploring fading frescoes within the castle walls.

The partnership with Sophie brings new elements into Nicolas Liebad's life, reigniting his interest in collaboration, problem-solving, and possibly hinting at a personal journey beyond mathematics.
