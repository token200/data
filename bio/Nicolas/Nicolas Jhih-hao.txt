**Personality:** Nicolas is a quiet and introspective individual who possesses a deep passion for traditional lantern-making. He is humble and unassuming, often preferring to let his work speak for itself rather than seeking the spotlight. Despite this, he has a gentle kindness and patience that allows him to connect with others on a deep level. As a master craftsman, Nicolas is meticulous and precise in his work, but he also has a playful side that emerges when working with others.

**Interests:** Nicolas's primary interest lies in the art of traditional lantern-making, which has been passed down through generations of his family.
