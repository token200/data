Here's a summary of Nicolas Koskinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Koskinen is an enigmatic and reclusive individual. He appears stoic and unapproachable, with a hint of curiosity that can be seen in his demeanor when faced with mysterious messages or unexpected opportunities. Despite his introverted nature, he has a deep sense of passion for art and is driven to explore the mysteries of the cosmos.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Koskinen stands at around 6'1" (185 cm), an imposing figure that commands attention in his dark, black coat.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an unnerving shade of blue, a color that seems almost otherworldly and piercing. They are said to bore into the darkness, as if searching for hidden truths.

**Interests:** Koskinen's primary interest lies in art, particularly painting and capturing the essence of human emotion on canvas. He is fascinated by abstract symbolism and sees himself as an artist attuned to the cosmic forces that shape the universe. His journey takes him further into exploring the mysteries of the cosmos, seeking a deeper understanding of his art and its connection to the stars.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Koskinen seems drawn to the unknown and the unexplained. The mysterious message from the unknown number sets off a chain of events that leads him to explore the abstract symbolism woven into his work and uncover the secrets hidden within it.

Koskinen's interests appear to be both personal (artistic expression) and cosmic (exploring the mysteries of the universe). This dichotomy suggests that he is a deeply introspective individual who sees his art as a reflection of his inner world, but also feels an inexplicable pull towards the vast expanse of the cosmos.
