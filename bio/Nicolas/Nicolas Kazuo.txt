He has a calm and collected demeanor, often adopting a neutral tone that makes him almost invisible to those around him. Despite this aloof exterior, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity, which he only reveals to those he trusts. As a result, he is intensely private and guarded, often hiding behind multiple personas to protect his true self.
