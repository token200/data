Based on the story about Nicolas Sadyrbaeva, I've created a fictional profile for her:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Age: 25
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Bright blue, almost icy in shade
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in loose waves that frame her heart-shaped face
- Skin Tone: Smooth and pale, with a subtle sprinkle of freckles across her cheeks

**Personality:**
Nicolas is an imaginative and curious individual who wears her passion for art on her sleeve. She's fiercely creative and has a keen eye for detail, which serves her well in her artistic pursuits. Nicolas is also empathetic and understanding, often finding herself drawn to those with troubled pasts or untold stories. Her sense of wonder and excitement about life is infectious, making her a joy to be around.

**Interests:**
- Art (painting, illustration, sculpture)
- Fantasy literature and mythology
- Travel (especially to European cities with rich histories)
- Collecting rare books and artifacts
- Exploring mystical energies and spiritual practices

As an artist who has discovered a new dimension of her craft through the world of magic, Nicolas is now on a quest to master her unique gift. With Maxim's guidance, she's about to embark on an epic journey that will take her far beyond the realms of reality.

Additional attributes:
- She has a quiet sense of confidence and can be quite reserved when meeting new people.
- Nicolas often carries a sketchbook with her wherever she goes, as inspiration strikes at any moment.
- Despite her artistic talents, Nicolas feels uncertain about the future and struggles to balance her passion for magic with the practicalities of everyday life.
