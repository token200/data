**Personality:** Claire appears to be a compassionate and introspective individual, driven by a deep connection to her hometown of Ravenswood.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel

It is assumed that Claire has brown hair, which could complement her hazel eyes. Her height and build are described as petite and slender, suggesting a reserved yet elegant presence.

**Interests:** As a psychologist, Claire's primary interest lies in understanding the human psyche. She is drawn to unraveling the complexities of the mind and exploring the intricacies of human behavior.

However, her connection to Ravenswood and its history suggests that she has a strong affinity for the town's secrets and mysteries. Her return to the town and reunion with Emily Koskinen imply that there may be more to Claire's interests than initially meets the eye. It seems that she is not just content with understanding the human mind but also seeks to uncover hidden truths about her hometown.

Claire's interest in Ravenswood and its history indicates that she values community, tradition, and perhaps even a sense of nostalgia. Her connection to Emily Koskinen suggests that there may be a deeper emotional investment at play, one that goes beyond professional curiosity or intellectual fascination.
