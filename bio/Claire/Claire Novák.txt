She is fiercely independent and determined, with a strong sense of self-reliance that stems from years of working alone as a novelist.

Her skepticism towards Sophie initially hides a deeper vulnerability, but as they bond over their love of writing, Claire's guard begins to drop, revealing a complex and sensitive individual beneath.

**Interests:**

In addition to writing, Claire is deeply interested in literature, poetry, and philosophy, often finding inspiration for her novels in the works of famous authors, philosophers, and thinkers.

Overall, Claire Novák is a multifaceted character with a rich inner life, driven by a passion for storytelling and a desire to connect with others who share her passions.
