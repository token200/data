Here is a summary of the fictional character Victoria Wei-lun:

**Physical Attributes:** Victoria Wei-lun stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, straight, and falls to her shoulders, framing her heart-shaped face and bright hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with intensity.

**Personality:** Despite her tough exterior, Victoria has a soft spot for those in need and is driven by a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely intelligent, strategic, and determined, which has helped her achieve great success in the corporate world. However, this drive often comes at the cost of her personal relationships and well-being.

**Interests:** Outside of business, Victoria enjoys hiking, practicing yoga, and reading self-help books to improve herself. She also loves art, music, and trying new cuisines, but has been too busy to pursue these interests until she met Sophia.

In terms of specifics, I've added the following details:

* Victoria's parents were modestly educated and worked hard to provide for her upbringing.
* She has a keen eye for design and fashion, often incorporating creative elements into her business ventures.
* Despite her success, Victoria feels like an imposter at times, struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.
* Sophia's influence has encouraged Victoria to explore her creative side, including writing poetry and starting a personal blog.

Overall, Victoria is a complex and dynamic individual who has undergone significant growth and transformation through her relationship with Sophia.
