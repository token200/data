**Physical Attributes:**
Stéphane Delacroix stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown, often worn long and unruly, framing his face and accentuating his angular features. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost indigo, which seem to hold a world of emotion within them. He has a strong jawline and full lips that curve into a subtle smile, adding to his enigmatic charm.

**Personality:**
Stéphane is an introverted and introspective person who has long been content with his solitary existence as an artist. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep-seated desire for connection and meaning. He is highly intelligent and perceptive, with a sharp mind that allows him to observe the world around him with precision. Stéphane is also intensely private, having built walls around himself over the years to protect his emotions from the world.

As he opens up to Sophia, it becomes clear that Stéphane is fiercely passionate about his art and has a deep love for life's complexities. He is empathetic and can put himself in others' shoes, which allows him to form meaningful connections with those around him. Despite his artistic talent, Stéphane struggles with self-doubt and feelings of isolation, making Sophia's presence in his life a lifeline.

**Interests:**
Stéphane's interests are deeply rooted in art, philosophy, literature, music, and the human experience. He is drawn to the works of existential philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger, which resonate with his own introspective nature. As an artist, he finds inspiration in the movements of Impressionism and Expressionism.

Stéphane is also a voracious reader, devouring books on psychology, sociology, and philosophy to gain deeper insights into the human condition. His musical tastes range from classical composers like Chopin and Debussy to modern artists like Max Richter and Olafur Arnalds. When not painting or reading, Stéphane can often be found lost in thought, reflecting on life's big questions and seeking answers within his art.

Sophia's influence has awakened a sense of purpose within Stéphane, inspiring him to explore new creative avenues and redefine what it means to live a fulfilling life.
