Here's a summary of Stéphane Kozłowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Stéphane Kozłowski is a tall and lean man in his mid-to-late 40s, with an athletic build that speaks to his active lifestyle. He stands at around 6'2" (188 cm) and has short, dark brown hair that's often neatly styled. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for any potential clues. A small scar above his left eyebrow hints at a past injury, adding to his air of rugged mystery.

**Personality:** Stéphane Kozłowski is a private and introspective individual, preferring the company of his own thoughts to that of others. His eyes are those of a seasoned detective, ever-vigilant for any detail that might lead him to a breakthrough. He's intensely curious and has a dry sense of humor that he only shares with those closest to him. Despite his tough exterior, Stéphane Kozłowski has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect those who trust him.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Stéphane Kozłowski's interests lie primarily in solving puzzles and uncovering the truth. He's an expert researcher and strategist, always on the lookout for new leads and connections. In his free time, he enjoys long walks along the riverbank of Ashwood, observing the town's inhabitants from afar. He's a whiskey connoisseur and can often be found sipping on a fine single-malt at the local café. Stéphane Kozłowski is also an avid reader, devouring books on history, psychology, and criminology to expand his knowledge and stay ahead of the game.

While not explicitly mentioned in the short story, I've added some additional details to flesh out Stéphane's character:

* He has a fondness for old records and vinyls, often listening to jazz or blues music while working on cases.
* His preferred mode of transportation is an old, restored Ford Mustang that he uses to patrol Ashwood's streets at night.
* Despite his reputation as a skilled detective, Stéphane Kozłowski has a secret weakness for baking – particularly when it comes to traditional Polish pastries like makowiec or pączki.

These details should help bring Stéphane Kozłowski to life as a complex and intriguing character!
