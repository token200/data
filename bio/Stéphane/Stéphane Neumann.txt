**Personality:**
Stéphane Neumann is a complex and introverted individual. He has a charming and charismatic exterior that makes him a sought-after presence in social situations, but beneath this façade lies a deeply sensitive and introspective soul. His quick wit and sharp tongue are often used to deflect attention or make light of uncomfortable conversations, hiding his true emotions.

However, despite his outgoing persona, Stéphane struggles with self-doubt and insecurity, frequently plagued by fears that he's not good enough or that his work is just a fluke. This internal conflict makes him guarded around others, as he's often uncertain about how to share his vulnerabilities.

**Interests:**
Stéphane Neumann has two primary interests: painting and storytelling through words. He is deeply passionate about creating art that conveys emotions, ideas, and experiences, often drawing inspiration from the world around him in Paris. His unique blend of realism and abstract expressionism sets him apart as an artist.

In addition to his love for art, Stéphane has a profound appreciation for literature and poetry, which is evident in his writing style and artistic approach. He spends hours scribbling poetry in the margins of his sketchbooks, pouring his heart onto the page.

The discovery of his great-grandfather's manuscript also reignites his passion for words, as he delves deeper into the world of Jewish poetry and becomes increasingly invested in sharing this piece of family history with others.
