I must correct you that I couldn't find any information about a fictional character named Stéphane Huffington either, so I'll create a new character inspired by the real-life entrepreneur and journalist, Arianna Huffington's husband, Michael Huffington, and his ex-wife,  Kathleen Stéphanie (no relation to the media personality).

However, considering that you asked for a female character inspired by the real-life media personality and entrepreneur Stéphanie Cohen-Huffman, I'll create a new character.

Here is a short summary about the fictional character Stéphanie:

Stéphanie "Steph" Huffington is a brilliant and compassionate journalist with a passion for storytelling. She stands at 5'8" with long, curly brown hair and bright blue eyes that sparkle with curiosity. Steph's style is eclectic and bohemian, reflecting her love of art and music.

As the founder of The Huffington Post (inspired by Stéphanie Cohen-Huffman), Steph has revolutionized the way people consume news online. She is driven by a desire to tell stories that need to be told, and her infectious enthusiasm has inspired countless journalists and entrepreneurs.

Despite her busy schedule, Steph is always up for an adventure, whether it's embarking on a road trip or exploring new places with friends. She is fiercely independent and values her freedom above all else. However, she also believes in the power of community and is deeply committed to supporting local causes and initiatives that promote social justice and human rights.

Steph's interests include photography, hiking, and cooking, which she loves to do with her loved ones. She is an avid reader and enjoys devouring books on history, philosophy, and psychology. When she's not working or exploring new horizons, Steph can be found practicing yoga or spending time in nature, finding solace in the peace and quiet of the world around her.
