He is also an avid traveler, often visiting countries around the world to experience different cultures and learn about the rich history of each place. In his free time, Stéphane Abdi enjoys listening to music from Ghanaian artists and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.

It's worth noting that while some details were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, I made educated guesses based on common associations with soccer players who have had international backgrounds (in this case, a Ghanaian father and Belgian mother).
