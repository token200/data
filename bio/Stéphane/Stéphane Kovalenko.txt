Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Stéphane Kovalenko:

**Personality:**
Stéphane is a brilliant and reclusive individual with a passion for mathematics. He is fiercely dedicated to his work, often neglecting his own needs and well-being in pursuit of understanding complex equations. Despite his exceptional abilities, he remains aloof and detached from the world around him, preferring the solitude of his own company. This can be seen as both a strength and a weakness, as it allows him to focus intensely on his work but also makes it difficult for him to connect with others.

**Physical Attributes:**
Stéphane is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, although exact details are not provided. He is described as being hunched over his workbench, suggesting a slightly stooped or wiry physique. His eyes are a piercing blue, which adds to his intensity and focus.

**Interests:**
Stéphane's primary interest is mathematics, specifically topology and number theory. He has spent years studying and researching these subjects, pouring over dusty tomes and scraps of paper covered in complex equations. His work on the theorem that could change the course of modern mathematics is a testament to his dedication and passion for the field.

In addition to mathematics, Stéphane's childhood experiences in Eastern Europe suggest that he has a strong appreciation for learning and education. He comes from a family of teachers who encouraged his curiosity and supported his academic pursuits.

Stéphane also seems to have an interest in nature, as evidenced by his tendency to gaze out the window at the snow-covered rooftops during moments of frustration or inspiration. This suggests that he may appreciate beauty and tranquility in the natural world.
