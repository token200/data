**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)

**Personality:**

Stéphane is a creative soul, driven by passion rather than logic. Despite facing hardships, he retains an optimistic outlook on life, finding beauty in the smallest details and connections to those around him. His artistic nature is not limited to painting; it also influences his perspective on life's intricacies. He is empathetic, with a deep connection to those left behind by circumstances.

**Interests:**

1. **Art:** Stéphane had initially pursued art but let it fall into the background after caring for his mother. Upon rediscovery of drawing and painting, he finds joy in capturing the essence of his surroundings - cityscapes that hold nostalgic value and emotional depth.

2. **Observation and Sketching:** The act of observing his environment closely, be it its sounds, colors, or textures, is an integral part of Stéphane's creative process. He sketches with a keen eye for detail, translating the ephemeral nature of life into permanent records that hold meaning long after the moment has passed.

3. **Nature and Human Connection:** The worn leather journal not only serves as a canvas but also as a portal to memories of his hometown and the people he left behind. Through art, Stéphane reconnects with what was lost and experiences moments of belonging and purpose.

4. **Inspiration and Renewal:** The journal represents more than just a tool for expression; it's a means to find inspiration in life's mundane routines, turning them into something transcendent through the act of creation itself.
