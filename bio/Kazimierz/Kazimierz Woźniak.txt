**Additional Details:** Kaz's small, cluttered shop is a testament to his unique personality: it's a treasure trove of eccentricities and curiosities. The walls are lined with rows of clock faces, each one telling a story of its own; there are vintage globes, antique scientific instruments, and even a few strange and exotic objects that Kaz has collected over the years.
