**Physical Attributes:**
Kazimierz Ławniczak is a tall man in his mid-40s, standing at approximately 6'2" (188 cm). He has dark brown eyes that seem to hold a deep intensity behind them. His hair is often unkempt, and he sports a scruffy beard that adds to his enigmatic appearance.

**Personality:**
Kazimierz Ławniczak is an introverted and quiet individual who is deeply passionate about art. Despite being a creative soul, he prefers to keep a low profile and avoid the spotlight. He is a perfectionist and can be quite self-critical when it comes to his artwork. However, this attention to detail has earned him a reputation as one of Warsaw's most skilled street artists.

He is particularly drawn to the intersection of these subjects, which inspires him to create thought-provoking murals that reflect the city's soul. In his free time, he enjoys exploring Warsaw's hidden corners and secret spaces, where he can find inspiration for his next piece.

As "Ławni," Kazimierz is always on the lookout for new ideas, techniques, and materials to incorporate into his art. He is a night owl and finds solace in the quiet hours of the morning, when he can retreat to his small studio apartment and lose himself in his creative world.

**Accounting Side:**
In contrast to his nocturnal exploits as Ławni, Kazimierz's day job as an accountant provides a sense of stability and normalcy. He enjoys working with numbers and patterns, which he believes helps him stay focused and grounded during the day. However, this aspect of his life remains relatively unknown to the public eye.
