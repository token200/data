He has a sensitive side, easily moved by the beauty of his surroundings and the stories of others. As his career takes off, he remains humble and true to his craft, never losing sight of his passion for art. He's fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else.

**Interests:** Kazimierz is deeply passionate about art, history, and literature. He spends hours reading books on Czech folk tales, mythology, and the history of Prague.
