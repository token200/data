Despite being a thief, Liebad seems to take pleasure in the challenge and thrill of outsmarting those who try to catch him.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm) - tall enough to be imposing but not so tall that it's off-putting.

Additionally, Liebad has an interest in the art of deception and misdirection. He is skilled in various forms of stealth and surveillance, often using these skills to evade detection. His affinity for rose petals, as seen on Winters' doorstep, might also indicate a romantic side or a desire for poetic gestures that leave his mark.

It's worth noting that there are no other known details about Liebad's personal life, family, or backstory. He seems to be a solitary figure with an almost mythical reputation among those who know him and respect him as a master thief.
