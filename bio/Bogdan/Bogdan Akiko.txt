Here is a summary of the fictional character Bogdan Akiko:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green, often described as an unnerving intensity by those who have seen them up close.

Personality:
Bogdan Akiko is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a quiet demeanor and prefers to keep to himself, finding solace in the company of a well-made whiskey rather than people. Despite his questionable past as a retired hitman, he possesses a wit that can be disarming when he chooses to use it.

Interests:
Bogdan has an affinity for whiskey and seems to have developed a taste for fine spirits over the years. However, beyond this interest, his motivations are largely driven by curiosity and a sense of adventure. He is drawn to missions that require a unique set of skills and can find himself lost in the thrill of the hunt.

It's worth noting that Bogdan's interests extend beyond just his professional pursuits. As he begins to form connections with Lena and starts to question his life choices, it seems that he might be developing a more introspective side, one where he finds solace in human relationships rather than relying solely on his skills for companionship.
