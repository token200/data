**Personality:**

Bogdan Oja is a driven and analytical individual with a strong passion for puzzle solving and cryptography. His nickname "The Enigma" reflects his exceptional skills in deciphering complex codes, and he takes pride in being able to unravel mysteries that others cannot. Bogdan's expertise has also made him somewhat of an enigma among his peers, as few know the true extent of his abilities or motivations.

Bogdan is a man of intrigue, with a mysterious side that draws people to him. His nickname suggests that he is someone who keeps secrets close to his chest and only reveals them when it suits him. Despite this, there's an underlying sense of respectability about Bogdan, as if he operates from a place of principle rather than malice.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Bogdan stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm), with an athletic build that suggests he spends time working out and staying physically fit.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a piercing blue, almost indigo, which seems to bore into those he meets. This gives him an air of authority and intensity.

**Interests:**

Bogdan's main interests revolve around puzzle solving and cryptography, which have become his life's work. He is fascinated by codes, ciphers, and cryptanalysis, and spends a significant amount of time studying these subjects. His expertise has led to involvement with top-secret organizations and private clients seeking his services.

In addition to his professional pursuits, Bogdan appears to be a whiskey aficionado, often enjoying a drink or two in quiet settings like the dimly lit bar where he was approached by the mysterious acquaintance. This suggests that Bogdan values relaxation and self-care, possibly as a way to recharge after completing high-stakes missions.

Outside of puzzle solving, very little is revealed about Bogdan's personal interests or hobbies. However, his encounter with the cryptic note sets him on a path that hints at a deeper desire for self-discovery and exploration.
