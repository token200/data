He also values the quiet moments of solitude that come with being near the sea, where he can reflect on his life and let his thoughts wander. Despite his love for the ocean, Bogdan seems to have a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures in life, like sharing stories with children and watching them grow and thrive.

Overall, Bogdan is a complex and multifaceted character who embodies both the rough-and-tumble qualities of a seasoned sailor and the gentle side of an old man who has come to appreciate the beauty of life's quiet moments.
