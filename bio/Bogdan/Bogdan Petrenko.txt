- Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and arms honed from years of combat training

**Personality:**
Petrenko is an enigmatic individual who exudes quiet confidence. He commands attention without ever demanding it, preferring to work behind the scenes rather than draw unnecessary attention to himself.

Petrenko is fiercely independent and prefers to keep people at arm's length, even those close to him.

**Interests:**
As a former soldier turned mercenary, Petrenko has a deep-seated appreciation for strategy and tactics. He enjoys analyzing battle plans and assessing his own performance in high-pressure situations. Outside of combat, he has a fascination with history, particularly the stories of forgotten soldiers who fought and died for their countries or ideals. On rare occasions, he's been known to indulge in whiskey-fueled gaming nights with fellow mercenaries, testing each other's skills in competitive tournaments.

**Additional Traits:**
Petrenko has an impressive skillset that includes martial arts expertise, marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and proficiency in multiple languages (including Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, and English). Despite his numerous adventures, he maintains a remarkably clean record of zero casualties on the battlefield.
