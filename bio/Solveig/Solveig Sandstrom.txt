Here's a summary of Solveig Sandstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Solveig is a reclusive and introverted person who has built walls around herself to protect her creative space. However, beneath her guarded exterior lies a complex and passionate individual with a deep love for her craft. She is highly precise and meticulous in her work, often getting lost in the intricacies of her designs. Despite this, Solveig is fiercely protective of her art and has a tendency to be wary of new people, making it challenging for others to get close to her. However, as she begins to open up to Maria, her true nature is revealed - kind, determined, and a passionate soul with a desire to explore new horizons.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Solveig stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm), with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are a deep shade of indigo blue, almost purple in hue, which seems to hold the same mystery and depth as her designs.
* Hair: Solveig's hair is dark brown, with subtle waves that cascade down her back. She often wears it tied back in a ponytail or bun, revealing her expressive face.

**Interests:**

Solveig's primary interest lies in textile art, particularly weaving and knitting. Her passion for creating intricate patterns with yarn and thread has led to international recognition, and she spends most of her days lost in the world of threads and fibers. However, as she begins to work with Maria, Solveig discovers a new sense of purpose - exploring new ideas and techniques that push the boundaries of what is possible with textile art.

In addition to her craft, Solveig also has a deep connection to her childhood village, where every thread and yarn was carefully selected for its unique properties. This attention to detail has shaped her artistic style and has led her to become one of the most celebrated textile artists in the world.
