Here's a summary of the fictional character Solveig Kalnina:

**Physical Attributes:**
Solveig Kalnina is a woman with a slender yet athletic build, standing at 5'8" (173 cm) tall. Her hair is dark brown and often styled in a neat bob, framing her heart-shaped face and bright hazel eyes that seem to sparkle with curiosity. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, adding a touch of whimsy to her otherwise elegant features.

**Personality:**
Solveig is a creative and analytical thinker, with a passion for art, music, and puzzle-solving that drives her to excel in her detective work. She's intelligent, resourceful, and has an innate ability to see connections between seemingly unrelated things. Her colleagues often tease her about being "artistic" in her approach, but this is precisely what makes her so effective at solving complex cases.

**Interests:**
Solveig's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting her love of art and music. She's an avid fan of Art Nouveau architecture and can spend hours exploring the streets of Riga, soaking up its vibrant colors and textures. She's also a keen music lover, with a deep appreciation for classical music and opera. When she's not working on a case, Solveig enjoys attending concerts, studying art history, and practicing yoga to clear her mind.

**Skills:**
Solveig is an exceptional detective with a unique combination of creative thinking, analytical skills, and attention to detail. Her passion for art and music gives her an edge in understanding the motivations behind crimes and spotting patterns that others might miss. She's also an expert researcher, able to dig up obscure facts and connections with ease.

**Quirks:**
Solveig has a habit of pacing around her office when she's deep in thought, much like the scene described in the story where she's retracing steps in her mind. Her colleagues have also noticed that she often hums or whistles softly to herself when working on a case, which can be both soothing and distracting at the same time!
