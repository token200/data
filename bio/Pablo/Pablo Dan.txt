**Additional Notes:**

Pablo Dan's character seems to be driven by an inherent desire for redemption and forgiveness, which he attempts to achieve through each new heist. His complex past and motivations create a rich and nuanced character that is both fascinating and relatable. The curse that follows him, tied to the Starlight Serenade, serves as a poignant reminder of his troubled history and serves as a reminder that the consequences of our actions can haunt us forever.
