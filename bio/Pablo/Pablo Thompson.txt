Here is a summary of Pablo Thompson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Pablo Thompson stands at 6'1" with a rugged, athletic build, honed from his decades-long career in the CIA. His dark brown eyes seem to hold a world of secrets, but also sparkle with warmth when he smiles. His dark hair is flecked with gray, giving him a distinguished air that commands respect.

**Personality:** Despite his tough exterior, Pablo has a soft spot for strays â€“ both human and animal. He is fiercely independent and prefers to keep people at arm's length, but once you earn his trust, he becomes fiercely loyal. His mysterious past has left him with a healthy dose of skepticism, but he is also intensely curious and loves nothing more than uncovering the secrets of the city.

**Interests:** Pablo is passionate about jazz music and the history of New Orleans, which drew him to The Voodoo Lounge. He is fascinated by the city's unique blend of cultures and its rich history, which he explores through his conversations with Mama LeRoux and other locals. He also enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, trying new foods and drinks, and learning about the various secret societies and mystical traditions that weave their magic into the fabric of the city. When not immersed in his research or sipping whiskey at The Voodoo Lounge, Pablo can be found walking Lola, his scruffy little terrier companion, through the French Quarter streets.

Overall, Pablo is a complex and intriguing individual with a rich inner life and a deep love for the city he now calls home.
