As an art critic, Pablo has built a reputation on his brutally honest reviews, but he is also drawn to the emotional resonance of each piece. He believes that art should challenge us, make us question our assumptions, and ultimately reveal something fundamental about the human condition.

In contrast to Sophia's passion for art as a creative force, Pablo sees it as an intellectual pursuit, one that requires dedication, analysis, and a willingness to take risks. Their conversation is a meeting of minds, each pushing the other to consider new perspectives on art, philosophy, and life itself.
