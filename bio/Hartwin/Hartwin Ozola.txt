Here's a summary of Hartwin Ozola's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:**
Hartwin is a creative and introspective person. He has a deep appreciation for art, history, and the city he calls home. His experiences growing up in Riga under Soviet rule have instilled in him a sense of nostalgia and awareness of the complexities of history. He is driven to capture the unseen moments of life through his photography, often lost in thought as he wanders the streets of Berlin.

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: Hartwin stands at around 5'10" (178 cm), tall enough to be noticed but not so tall that it overshadows his artistic presence.
- Eye Color: His eyes are a deep brown, like the rich soil of Latvia where he grew up.
- Hair Color and Style: Unspecified in the original text, but we can imagine Hartwin having dark, messy hair that adds to his rugged, creative aura.

**Interests:**
As a photographer, Hartwin's primary interest is in capturing the essence of urban landscapes. He is particularly drawn to hidden spaces between buildings, overgrown lots, and other overlooked areas that hold secrets on the wind. His passion for art, history, and the human experience drives him to explore these forgotten corners through his lens.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Hartwin seems to be intrigued by music (as mentioned in passing when he hears the distant thrum of a club). He also appears to have an appreciation for the arts scene in Berlin, participating in exhibitions and networking with other creatives.
