I must correct you again - there is no such fictional character as Hartwin Navratilova. However, I can create a fictional profile for Martina Navratilova's brother.

Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Hartwig Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
Eye Color: Bright blue
Hair Color: Dark brown
Build: Athletic, with broad shoulders and a lean physique

**Personality:**
Hartwig is a calm and collected individual, often serving as the voice of reason in times of chaos. He's a natural mediator, able to bring people together and find common ground. Despite his reserved nature, Hartwig has a dry sense of humor that can catch those around him off guard.

**Interests:**
Hartwig is an avid outdoorsman and enjoys hiking, camping, and fishing in his free time. He's also passionate about music, playing the guitar and writing his own songs. As a tennis enthusiast, he often attends matches and supports his sister Martina's rivalries and triumphs. Hartwig has a deep appreciation for history and culture, particularly Czech heritage.

In this fictional profile, I've made up most of the details, while drawing inspiration from real-life sources, such as Martina Navratilova's story.
