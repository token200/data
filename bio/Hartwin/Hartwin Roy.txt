Here's a summary of Hartwin Roy's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Hartwin Roy is known for his dry wit, unorthodox teaching methods, and sadistic tendencies. He has a playful sense of humor and enjoys pushing his students' boundaries to keep them engaged. Despite his somewhat unconventional approach, he has a deep affection for his subject matter, particularly the Venus flytrap.

**Physical Attributes:** Hartwin Roy is described as standing with a worn chalk that looks like it's been through a war, suggesting that he may be slightly older and more rugged around the edges. Unfortunately, no specific height or eye color are mentioned in the short story. However, based on his dry wit and sarcastic tone, I would imagine him to have piercing brown eyes that sparkle with amusement.

**Interests:** As we see from the short story, Hartwin Roy is passionate about botany, particularly photosynthesis and the unique characteristics of plants like the Venus flytrap. He also seems to enjoy provoking thought-provoking conversations, as evidenced by Abed's question about a vegan diet for the Venus flytrap.
