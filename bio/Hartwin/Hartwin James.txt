**Personality:** Hartwin is a compassionate and empathetic individual who genuinely cares about his clients' struggles. Despite being an accountant, he is not just focused on numbers but also understands the emotional aspect of business and its impact on people's lives. He is willing to go above and beyond for his clients, especially those who are struggling, as evident from his willingness to work with Emily Wilson. His frustration with managing finances often gets the better of him, but when he connects with someone genuinely passionate about their work, it brings out a more positive side of his personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Hartwin is likely in his mid-to-late 30s or early 40s, given the context of running a small accounting firm. He stands at around 5'9" to 5'11", with a slender build that suggests he spends most of his time sitting at a desk. His eyes are a warm, hazel brown color that seem to sparkle when he's engaged in conversation or interested in someone's passion project.

**Interests:** Hartwin loves numbers and finance, but it seems that he has a creative side that is not immediately apparent. When Emily Wilson talks about her photography business, his interest piqued, he becomes more than just an accountant; he sees potential for growth and connection. It appears that he enjoys learning about people's passions and interests outside of their work.
