He is confident in his abilities and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to solve cases and help those in need. Despite his impressive skills, he remains humble and unassuming, preferring to work behind the scenes rather than seeking the spotlight.

**Physical Attributes:** Mario Zarina stands at an average height of 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean yet athletic build. His eyes are a piercing blue, often fringed with thick eyelashes that add to his suave and sophisticated demeanor. His most distinctive feature, however, is his impressive mustache, which he carefully maintains and trims to perfection.
