Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' life and works, I've created a fictional character profile for Takahashi Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of golden brown
- Hair: Dark brown, styled in a slightly unruly manner
- Skin Tone: Olive-toned, reflecting his mixed heritage
- Build: Slender, with a wiry physique

**Personality:**
Takahashi Luis Borges is a introspective and imaginative individual. He has a strong affinity for abstract concepts and philosophical debates, often finding himself lost in thought. Despite this, he possesses a dry sense of humor and can be quite witty when the occasion calls for it. Takahashi values knowledge and ideas above all else, and his vast library reflects his insatiable curiosity.

**Interests:**
- Writing (short stories, poetry, and philosophical essays)
- Reading (philosophy, literature, mathematics, and history)
- Philosophy and metaphysics
- Music (classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes)
- Traveling and exploring new places

**Habits:**

* Takahashi often writes in the early morning hours, when the city is still quiet.
* He has a habit of collecting rare books and manuscripts, which he displays proudly in his study.
* Takahashi is an avid sketch artist, often capturing scenes from nature or cities on paper.

**Strengths:**
- Quick-witted and sharp-tongued
- Highly intelligent and analytical thinker
- Passionate about sharing ideas and discussing abstract concepts

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be overly self-critical when it comes to his writing
- Struggles with social interactions, preferring quiet time alone to engage in thought-provoking discussions.
