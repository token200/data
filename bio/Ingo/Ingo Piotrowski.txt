**Personality:** Ingo Piotrowski is an introverted and quiet individual who appears unlikely to be the hero he becomes. He is book-smart and has a curiosity about the unknown that drives him to uncover hidden knowledge. Despite his initial reluctance to take on the responsibilities that come with possessing The Atlas, Ingo proves to be brave, resourceful, and determined.

**Physical Attributes:** Ingo Piotrowski stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) tall. His eye color is a deep brown, often hidden behind a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose. He has unruly dark hair that often falls across his forehead, and a lean, athletic build despite his reserved nature.

**Interests:** Ingo's interests are centered around books, particularly those on obscure and esoteric subjects. He is fascinated by ancient civilizations, lost knowledge, and cryptic languages. The Atlas of Lost Cities is the catalyst for his newfound adventures, but he has always been drawn to the unknown and the mysterious. Outside of his work as a librarian, Ingo enjoys reading, researching, and puzzles, which serve as a source of comfort and mental stimulation in his quiet life.

It's worth noting that while Ingo's background as a librarian provides him with a unique set of skills and knowledge, it is not explicitly stated in the short story.
