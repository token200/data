Since the original request was to write about Ingo Hussein, I must inform you that I couldn't find any information on a character by that name. However, assuming that "Ingo Hussein" is a fictional character inspired by or similar to Saddam Hussein, here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Name:** Ingo Hussein (a fictional alias)

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Black
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique
* Facial Features: Chiseled jawline, prominent nose, and piercing dark eyes

**Personality:**

Ingo Hussein is a complex and enigmatic figure. He exudes an air of confidence and charisma, but beneath his polished exterior lies a ruthless pragmatist. As a leader, he is calculated and cunning, always seeking to expand his power and influence. Despite his tough exterior, Ingo has a dry sense of humor and can be quite witty when the situation calls for it.

**Interests:**

Ingo Hussein is an avid collector of rare and ancient artifacts, with a particular fascination for Mesopotamian history and culture. He is also an accomplished polo player and enjoys playing chess as a way to unwind. In his younger years, he was an enthusiastic surfer, often spending hours riding the waves on the Persian Gulf coast.

Please note that these attributes are purely fictional and not based on any real individual, including Saddam Hussein.
