**Personality:** Ingo is a determined and tenacious individual with a strong sense of justice. He is unorthodox in his approach to detective work, often relying on his instincts and unconventional methods to solve cases. Despite his tough exterior, he has a compassionate side and can't help but feel a twinge of admiration for Maria's determination. Ingo is driven by a desire to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, with a sharp, intelligent glint
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn slightly tousled and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, honed from years of physical activity and investigative work
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and deep-set eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Ingo is deeply passionate about his work as a detective and is driven by a desire to solve complex cases. Outside of the office, he enjoys:

* Reading true crime novels and biographies of famous detectives
* Exploring the city's hidden corners and abandoned places (much like the riverbed where Maria was found)
* Playing the guitar in his spare time, often listening to blues music that fuels his investigative instincts
* Traveling to new locations, always on the lookout for fresh perspectives and clues to solve his next case

Ingo is a man of few words but is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. His reputation as a brilliant detective has earned him a place in the hearts of many, and he takes pride in being the go-to investigator for Azura's most challenging cases.
