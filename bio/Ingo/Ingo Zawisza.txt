He is deeply introspective and has a tendency to get lost in his own world, as seen when he becomes completely absorbed in his art. This intensity can sometimes make him appear standoffish or distant to those who don't know him, but beneath the surface, he is fiercely sensitive and empathetic.

* Painting (his primary passion and creative outlet)
* Music (he has been known to compose music while working on his art)
* Reading (especially literature and poetry that explores themes of identity, culture, and social justice)
* Traveling (specifically to Poland and other European countries with rich artistic histories)
* Philosophy (he is deeply interested in existentialism and the human condition)

It's worth noting that Ingo's interests are not exhaustive, but rather a reflection of his eclectic and creative nature. His art is an integral part of who he is, and everything else seems to revolve around it.
