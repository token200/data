Based on the provided story, here's a summary of the fictional character Ingo Novák:

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are mentioned in the story. However, considering the protagonist's introspective and emotional nature, I will assign some characteristics that might fit his personality type.

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue, reflecting the turmoil and intensity within

**Personality:** Ingo Novák is a complex and introverted individual. He struggles with unspoken emotions, carrying the weight of deceit and unresolved feelings on his shoulders. His personality can be described as:

* Brooding and introspective
* Emotionally guarded
* Haunted by past experiences and regretful choices
* Lacking in social connections, feeling invisible to those around him

**Interests:** Given his character's background and emotional state, I imagine that Ingo Novák has a few interests that reflect his inner turmoil:

* Writing (perhaps poetry or short stories) as an outlet for his emotions
* Music, particularly classical compositions that evoke feelings of melancholy and introspection
* Reading literature that explores themes of identity, morality, and the human condition

**Background:** Unfortunately, not much is revealed about Ingo Novák's past in the story. However, based on his behavior and emotional state, it seems likely that he has experienced some significant losses or betrayals in his life, leading to a deep sense of mistrust and disillusionment with others.

Please note that these details are purely imaginative, as there is no real character by the name of Ingo Novák in any notable work.
