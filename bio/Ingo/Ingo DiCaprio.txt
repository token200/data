Based on the short story provided, here's a summary of Ingrid Diana Caprio's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ingrid is a free-spirited individual who values living life on her own terms. She's a hopeless romantic with a strong sense of determination and a desire to chase her dreams. Her unconventional methods and love for natural remedies often lead to humor and playful teasing from her friends, earning her the nickname "Wild Ingo."

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Striking green eyes with a hint of gold around the iris
* Hair: Wild, curly mane of hair that falls down her back like a waterfall

**Interests:** Ingrid's primary interests include herbalism and natural healing. She spends most of her time learning about the medicinal properties of various plants, experimenting with new remedies, and studying under Max's guidance. Her passion for helping others is matched only by her love for adventure and exploring the great outdoors.

It seems that I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ingo DiCaprio, so I've created a new character based on the surname "DiCaprio."
