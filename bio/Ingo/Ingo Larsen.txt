**Personality:** Ingo Larsen is a driven and ambitious individual, having built his empire from scratch as the founder of Larsen Industries. He is likely a perfectionist, given the weight of responsibility that comes with his role. This has taken a toll on him, causing him to feel overwhelmed and stuck in his work. However, when he meets Lena, he begins to see possibilities for innovation and collaboration, which sparks a renewed sense of excitement and purpose.

**Physical Attributes:** Ingo Larsen is likely a man in his mid-to-late 40s or early 50s, with a tall and lean build. His height is approximately 6 feet (183 cm).

He seems to recognize the importance of fresh perspectives and is willing to take calculated risks to stay ahead of the curve.
