As a seasoned thief and assassin, Ingo is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to operate outside the boundaries of conventional morality.

He is an expert in stealth, deception, and strategy, always seeking to improve his skills and stay one step ahead of his competitors.

His experiences in the underworld have left him with a deep sense of empathy and understanding for those on the fringes of society.

In terms of personal relationships, Ingo has a complex web of acquaintances and adversaries who are wary of his reputation. Those close to him struggle to penetrate his reserve, but he is fiercely loyal to those few individuals who have earned his trust.

Ultimately, Ingo's interests revolve around unraveling the enigma that surrounds himself â€“ not just about his own past but also about the people and motivations that drive him forward in this shadowy world of espionage, deception, and ancient mysteries.
