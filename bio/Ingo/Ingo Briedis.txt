Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ingo Briedis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ingo Briedis appears to be a highly skilled and experienced private investigator with a reputation for being elusive and untouchable. He seems to be confident and self-assured, as evident from his raised eyebrow when Anastasia approaches him with a case. His ability to read people and situations is also apparent, as he can sense the urgency in Anastasia's voice and the gravity of Sofia Jensen's situation.

**Physical Attributes:** Ingo Briedis is likely a tall and imposing figure, given the description of Anastasia as being behind him when he steps out of the alleyway. His height is not explicitly mentioned, but based on his confidence and presence, it's possible that he stands at around 6'2" or taller.

In terms of eye color, there is no explicit mention, but considering Ingo's background as a KGB agent, it's likely that his eyes are darker and more intense. Anastasia describes Sofia Jensen as having striking blue eyes, which may be an indicator of the contrast between Sofia and Ingo's physical appearance.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Ingo Briedis is clearly interested in espionage, counter-intelligence, and the world of Eastern European politics. His reputation for being "untouchable" suggests that he has a strong sense of loyalty to those he believes in and a drive to uncover the truth.

Ingo's interests may also extend to investigative work, analysis, and strategy. As a skilled investigator, he likely enjoys solving complex problems and piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. His willingness to take on high-stakes cases like Sofia Jensen's suggests that he is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect those who are vulnerable.

It's worth noting that Ingo's personal interests or hobbies are not explicitly mentioned in the short story, but based on his background and personality, it's possible that he enjoys activities such as reading, researching, or working out to maintain his physical fitness.
