**Personality:** Marcelle Handschuh is a brilliant and eccentric artist known for her unconventional and avant-garde approach to sculpture. She is innovative, passionate, and unapologetic in her pursuit of artistic expression. Her parents' nurturing environment encouraged her creativity, and she grew up surrounded by the Berlin art scene's emphasis on nonconformity. This upbringing shaped her confident and independent personality, allowing her to take risks and push boundaries in her work. Despite her success, Marcelle remains committed to her artistic vision, refusing to compromise her creative integrity.

**Interests:** Marcelle's interests lie deeply within the realm of art and innovation. As a kinetic sculptor, she is fascinated by the intersection of physics, mathematics, and creative expression. Her work is driven by a desire to challenge perceptions and push the boundaries of what is possible with materials and techniques.

Her fascination with the nature of reality and perception drives her to create immersive experiences that blur the lines between the artist's world and the viewer's perceptions.
